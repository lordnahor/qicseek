				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been working with a team of entrepreneurs in designing a Visual Sharing and Reflection system based primarily on mobile phones.    It is nice to see that this application, called VisR, is now released on Android. From the description of the application,</p>
<blockquote><p>
VisR:</p>
<p>VisR helps you spontaneously capture, share, organize, and reflect on moments effortlessly.  Seize the moments and relive with friends and family. Never again spend countless tedious hours searching for and organizing pictures on your phone.  </p>
<p>Do you love sharing  experiences, but find it aggravating to locate the perfect picture to describe it?  VisR removes this issue. VisR automagically classifies and organizes photos utilizing information readily available on your mobile phone in a what, when, where, and who form that is specific to you. You can find the photo of interest and with a few taps post it to your favorite place such as Facebook or Twitter.
</p></blockquote>
<p>iPhone application is coming soon.</p>
<p>Currently VisR is free and is also supported by a website where you can see all photos shared by you and others.  As usual, what you see is a very early functionality of this system.  The team wants to move fast and make an application that allows you to share your moments (may be using special effects and special lenses) spontaneously, but also effortlessly organize all the photos that you take in a form natural for you to access and share.  It uses events to organize photos but these events, unlike many current systems, and not just the date, but use multiple sources to identify them.</p>
<p>I am very happy to share this News with you.  I do intend to use all the feedback and work with the team in refining the system so my almost 20 year old dream of organizing and accessing photos and other visual media may become reality soon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Comes 2009 (which conveniently I consider for this discussion as 2010) and we enter the new decade &#8212; lets call Teens.  Teens brought smartphones, first iPhone and then Android.  The camera in these phones is not the same quality as P6000 or D80, but is acceptable quality.  But these devices (yes I carry both â€“ call me crazy) have excellent quality camera from my perspective because now I rarely print photos and the 5MegaPixel is more than enough quality to view on a monitor and on my phone.  More importantly, I can immediately send photos I capture at the moment and of the moment to Facebook or email them to relevant people.  The luxury I did not have earlier.  Now I can literally share moments with my friends and family 10,000 miles away within moments of those key moments.  Moreover, I can broadcast them or directly share them.  And the cost to do this is the most attractive â€“ ZERO.  And the convenience â€“ well I have my phones always with me â€“ so I donâ€™t need to carry any special camera with me.  </p>
<p>So now I donâ€™t have to even think of my cameras.  I noticed that first my D80 stopped traveling with me.  And in the last two trips it did not travel even to places where normally it would have gone.  But what is more surprising is that though P6000 went with me but did not come out of my bag.  All the photos that I took were taken using VisR on Android, and many were taken using iPhone camera.  I also took some photos using Instagram and in Foursquare.  This trip I did not take any photos using picplz or Path â€“ I have no explanation â€“ just that is what happened.  Several photos that I took were shared immediately on Facebook and I even heard comments from people within minutes.  In one case even got some helpful hints.</p>
<p>And this is just the beginning of Teens.  All indications are that photography is going through same temperamental period as Teens go through.  Based on all technological progress ranging from hardware to software to social practices to spread of cameras in developing countries to more than 75% of all humans, I am eagerly waiting to see how this field is going to evolve.  I must say, however, that I am very optimistic about the future of photography as a experience sharing medium.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago, I came back from a trip to Evanston, Illinois.  There I met lots of important and interesting people and took lots of photos.  The weekend before that also traveling and was in Tempe for an event on digital culture and took lots of photos at the event and other places.  On my return flight from Chicago, I was reflecting on my own photo taking behavior.  The changes in my behavior are nothing short of astounding.  Maybe I am the only one going though this change â€“ but somehow I feel that I am not the only one, but that the society is going through a very interesting and very rapid transformation in photo taking behavior.  I will describe my behavior over three decades â€“ though the dates donâ€™t exactly coincide with the calendar dates but are close enough for the message.</p>
<p>In 90s (that is 1990s), I was still living in the 20th century.  I used to take my camera only to very important events and was quite careful in taking photos â€“ subconsciously I believed in Kodak Moments because I knew that I will have to pay to Kodak for each photo twice once when I bought the role and then when I got it developed.  Those were the days, when I was quite careful in deciding which moments are really important to capture and save because they had to be valuable to me in terms of inconvenience of taking my camera with me, money for film and its development, organizing those photos in a form that I could reflect those moments, and share those moments by sending photos.</p>
<p>In 2000s, I started using my digital camera â€“ went through many generations of cameras from low Mega Pixels to 14 Mega Pixels with increasingly sophisticated features both in my pocket instant cameras to my SLR cameras.  In 2010 it was common for me to carry on all important trips at least a Nikon P6000 and Nikon D80.  The P6000 was always in my bag and was most of the time with me.  In early part of the decade I was still quite conscious of the fact that each photo needed to be transferred to my computer and required lots of memories.  In fact, I even deleted photos that were blurred or duplicate.  I slowly started using multiple photo management software and started kind of dumping my photos because the storage was becoming cheap.  Sharing was a serious issue in the early part of the decade.  I even printed some photos and sent hard copies to people.  In some cases I event sent photos by mid decade.  Towards the end of the decade, I was regularly uploading photos on multiple computers and even some cloud-based services â€“ even became premium user on multiple services.  Even started using Eye-Fi card to automatically transfer photos using Wi-Fi services so I did not have to spend time on transferring photos.  This resulted in a very interesting change.  Earlier I regularly transferred â€˜goodâ€™ photos on Flickr but now I automatically transferred them all to Flickr in addition to my hard disk.  This also meant that all my photos on Flickr became private â€“ did not want to spam people; and I did not have time to go to Flickr and change privacy settings for â€˜goodâ€™ photos.  So,  in a funny but true sense as I started taking more photos, I started sharing fewer photos.</p>
<p>Some other interesting changes took place because of the arrival of Facebook.  Since many of my friends started sharing photos and many people I wanted to share photos with were on Facebook, I started uploading important photos on Facebook.    I was very motivated to carry both my P6000 and D80 in 2008 and  part of 2009 to all places and important events that I visited â€“ was very motivated to capture lots of moments visually and then share those with my friends and family. </p>
