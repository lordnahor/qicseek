<p><LI><A NAME="QQ1"><B>How is E-mail sent and received over the 
Internet?</B></a><br>
<p>The Internet is now the fastest way to send mail from 
one place to another.  In order to send and receive 
electronic mail, a person first needs a mailing address.  This
address is comprised of a name followed by a domain. The name is a
selected identifier which is unique to each person, just like the 
first line of a regular mailing address. The domain serves as the 
computerized street address. It lets the "cyberspace mailman" know
which computer system to deliver the mail to.  Again, like a conventional
mailing address, it is possible to have two people with the same
name on the Internet, but they have different domains to distinguish
between the two. This way, everyone on the <b><a href="ftp://ftp.concert.net/netinfo/interest-groups.txt">
Internet's mailing list</a></b> has a unique and identifiable address. 
In order to find someone's e-mail address, just dial <b><a href="http://www.four11.com/Sled.html">
411 (Directory Services)</a></b> for help.

<p><LI><A NAME="QQ2"><B>How is information linked together on the World 
Wide Web? </B></A><br>
<p>One of the greatest features of the World Wide Web is its ability to link documents and
resources to each other. This connection of information is made possible by Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).
The <b><a href="http://oneworld.wa.com/htmidev/devpage/dev-page.html">HTML Developer's JumpStation</b></a> 
contains many resources on developing, editing, and converting HTML documents that can link to other 
documents on the Internet. There are also sites on the Internet such as <b><a href="ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/lweitzel/wow/home.html"> 
The Web of Wonder</b></a> which are specifically designed to provide over 1,500 links to places 
on the Internet.

<p><LI><A NAME="QQ3"><B>What methods of policing and control are utilized in 
regards to the World Wide Web and who is responsible for this task?</B></A><br>
<p>With so many people accessing "cyberspace" at one time, security is an 
essential part of the Internet's success. <b><a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW">CERN</b></a>
, the Switzerland based laboratory where the World Wide Web was developed, assumes
much of the responsibility of policing the Web.<b><a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW">CERN</b></a>
offers security through <b><a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Shen/ref/shen.html">SHEN: A Security 
Scheme for the World Wide Web</b></a> The purpose of <b><a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Shen/ref/shen.html">
SHEN</b></a> is to develop way to secure mail, file transfers, and information in the Web.
In addition, there are many services such as <b><a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/bsy/www/sec.html">Security 
Resources</b></a> and <b><a href="http://www.greatcircle.com/gca/tutorial/main.html">Internet Security
Firewalls</b></a> that focus primarily on preventing hackers from invading
your computer.  A comprehensive guidebook on <b><a href="ftp://nic.merit.edu/documents/fyi/fyi_08.txt">
Internet Security </b></a> shows the many security issues facing Net users
and how they can deal with these issues.

<p><LI><A NAME="QQ4"><b>How does one find information and resources in the 
World Wide Web?</a></b>
<p>Due to the incredible number of documents, files, and pages accessible
on the World Wide Web, it is often difficult to find out exactly where
these sites are located.  Thankfully, <b><a href="http://www.bbcnc.org.uk/babbage/iap.html">
Search Engines</a></b> are available which help to locate specific areas that
exist in the Web.  There are many types of search tools, or spiders, available that
 will help you find your way around cyberspace.  
<b><a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/home/mcbryan/WWWW.html">
The World Wide Web Worm</a></b> is a common search tool that conducts searches by
keyword, title, or URL.  You can also search the web with <b><a href="http://nearnet.gnn.com/wic/newrescat.toc.html">
The Whole Internet Catalog</a></b> which offers an updated list of sites
arranged by category.  These search engines are the best way to find the 
exciting and interesting resources, services, and information that
the World Wide Web has to offer.

<p><LI><b><A NAME="QQ5">What is the United States' current economic 
position?</a></b>
<p>The U.S. economy is facing tough times with the dollar slipping in value
compared to other national currencies. Political unrest in Europe and 
other parts of the world have hurt <a href="gopher://infopath.ucsd.edu">U.S. foreign trade</a>,
 while NAFTA and 
GATT have made efforts to increase trade revenues.  While <a href="gopher://wiretap.spies.com">
Bill Clinton's economic plan</a> aims to "increase public investment" and "reduce the deficit",
the recent Republican takeover of Washington has threatened this agenda. 
As a result, the inflation rate is threatening to rise and consumer spending is 
declining.
