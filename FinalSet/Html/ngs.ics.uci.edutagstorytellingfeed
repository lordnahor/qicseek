				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the best post that I  read in some time on â€˜dataâ€™ is by Om Malik. <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/03/26/why-data-without-a-soul-is-meaningless/" title="Om Malik"> See here.</a></p>
<p>This post made me think about all the buzz about Big Data.  The situation is exactly same as that described in the famous fable of &#8216;Six Blind Men and an Elephant&#8221;.  Different communities approach big data from their very limited perspective.  So here is my perspective on one aspect of big data &#8212; its use for telling compelling stories.  I recently wrote something on this topic:  <a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/5644217/IEEE%20Multimedia%20Storytelling%20Jan%202013.pdf" title="in Multimedia">See Micro and Mega Stories</a>.</p>
<p>We collect data and use data effectively to enhance our experiences and tell stories. But this requires understanding relationships among disparate data items. And that is where the importance of Big Data really lies.<br />
A major transformation going on in society currently is the nature of story telling. At one time story telling was based on subjective experiences by an individual that were only qualitatively available to the storyteller. The last decade has seen the arrival of â€˜dataâ€™ and objective story telling. Human memory is powerful but has its limitations. Subjective human memory results in powerful anecdotes. Add to this availability of large volumes of data and ability to attach it to strengthen those anecdotes and you got powerful and compelling factual stories.</p>
<p>Storytelling is changing &#8212; whether for entertainment or for business or for education.  It is going to be more objective &#8211; more based on data.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are living in the age of transformations.  Even the most ancient and most popular art, the art of storytelling, is being transformed by the emerging technology, particularly first by Computers and now by Mobile Phones.  My research in the last few years has been related to some aspects of storytelling using emerging technology.  Storytelling plays a very central role in human life and society.  The nature of storytelling is closely related to how we communicate, how cultural traditions are formed, how we learn and educate, and how we entertain.  <a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/5644217/Extreme%20Stories%20120902.pdf" title="Emerging storytelling" target="_blank">This white paper</a> is the result of my observations in this fascinating area.  I would love to hear your comments and suggestions on this.</p>
<p>Here is a link to the white paper: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/5644217/Extreme%20Stories%20120902.pdf</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Extreme Stories: 13<br />
Storytelling is a well-known art that almost everybody practices.  Some people have special talents, some acquire reasonable ability, and some just manage to use it for their  interactions.  There has been much written about it.<br />
With increasing amount of data capture, there is a rise in new kind of storytelling, however.  This is based on data, using talents to use the data for communicating the point that the storyteller is interested in conveying.  This kind of storytelling is not related to weaving through individual events as is done in most traditional storytelling.  Here a storyteller uses appropriate data collected over time to convey the story.  Usually, there is a predetermined theme and finding from the data and this needs to presented using appropriate rendering of the data.  Statistical approaches are used to summarize this data to make the story compelling.  Powerful visualization techniques have emerged to represent and render spatio-temporal-thematic data in compelling form.  Combination of all these analytical tools with visualization techniques started becoming popular even before computers arrived.  With computing power, more attention was given to such tools.  The last few years have seen significantly more attention being given to data analytics and visualization approaches.  This trend is likely to continue for some time.<br />
The nature of storytelling with large volume of data, commonly called Big Data, is taking another extreme form.  In micro stories, one presents just a simple, or atomic, event and all data and information related to that to convey experience of that event.  On the other extreme, using analytics and visualization one conveys mega stories that use large volumes of data to convey summary of experiences collected over long time, at relevant geographic locations, and across relevant themes.</p>
<p>One thing is clear: the nature of storytelling is evolving.  We will see increasing number of stories that will be told using data.  New forms of storytelling approaches will emerge for this new type of storytelling.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So how do people tell stories when they have lots of events that are seemingly related to the what needs to be told but telling everything in gory details makes a story boring and may be counterproductive to the goal of the storyteller.  Another common constraint is the time or space available.  Thus, a storyteller must â€˜coverâ€™ all important events that make for a compelling story under given constraints and for each of those events it must use the experience of the event to maximize the interestingness of the story.  This is not a easy problem to solve.  It requires two important â€˜selection decisionsâ€™ and a rendering challenge.  The first decision is to select n events out of m where m may be much larger than n and the second decision is which experience associated with the event are best for the goal.  Another challenge is related to threading or rendering these experiences using multiple media in a proper sequence to make the most impact.<br />
In good old days, life was simple.  Stories either had only text, or audio, or video.  In most cases, the experience was not even concretely collected, it was more based on the memory of the storyteller or was created based on the imagination â€“ which in turn could be based on some memories &#8212;  and had to be rendered using only one medium.<br />
Advances in capture mechanisms as well as ease in rendering multiple media easily means that people collect more and diverse experiential event data and they collect more events.  That has a very interesting effect on society.  More people are interested in storytelling using real event data collected for events.  More stories are being told using real data collected by more people.  Also, more people are becoming storytellers.  In a sense, applications like Path, tiny reviews, Instagram, Foursquare, and FitBits are encouraging more people to tell more data-driven stories.  At this stage, many of these applications seem to be in early stage and are very exciting.  But we have a tendency to get used to the initial excitement and then want more either from the same or develop new applications that will take us farther.  Todays exciting technology becomes tomorrows routine and becomes unsatisfactory day-after-tomorrow.<br />
Current popular applications are related to predominantly one medium related to an event.  More sophisticated applications like making videos or creating albums or creating scrapbooks are way too tedious and time consuming and are based on last centuryâ€™s technology.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This emerging form of the story is more data-driven.  It will use meta data as well as data intentionally and consciously captured by a person who may be collecting this for personal use, but then may decide to share the experience of the event with others.  Obviously, every story is to share your experiences.  That means that the storyteller customizes the experiences to be included in the story based on his/her knowledge of the interests of recipients of the story.</p>
<p>Even micro-stories should consider the experiences that the storyteller wants to include in the story targeted to specific audience.  Most of these stories are being told using mobile phones.  This is good, because mobile phones are much better experience and even capture devices than any that existed so far.  They collect much information, sometimes too much, for micro-storytelling.  There are already some applications that are going in this direction. Path and Tiny Reviews are two of my current favorites.  One may even consider Instagram to be one such application.</p>
<p>So far, video has not being used much in such micro stories.  Video will become popular sometimes in very near future.  Even audio, not only speech but also audio of the environments in which events take place, is not currently used much.  This is also likely to become popular.</p>
<p>Effectively, the current trend suggests that we are using &#8216;low hanging fruits&#8217; in experiential data.  Once we have used these, micro stories will migrate to using more experiential data.</p>
