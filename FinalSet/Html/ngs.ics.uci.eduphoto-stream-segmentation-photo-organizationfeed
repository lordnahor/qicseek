		<description><![CDATA[Quite frankly, I would rather like to save or organize my photos locally on my machine rather than doing it on internet. Although I donâ€™t feel any harm in doing so but somehow the security concerns are always there. 

There&#039;s no doubt that many websites have very strong security settings as far as images are concerned i.e. you can not just copy the images, but loopholes are always there. I would rather say that arrange for some good photo organizing software (adobe provides such software) and then organize your photos locally.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are a number of metrics which are easily harvested programatically which
might be useful if assigned to an image. Given a collection of images, they are
scanned and the following attributes are determined.

time delta
    duration between this image and prev, next.

geometric complexity 
    indicated by the degree that the image can be compressed.

chromatic complexity
    number of discrete colors in image

average color
    dominant color of image

I&#039;m sure others will become evident, they share the characteristic of being
available solely by examining the image data.    


When images are tagged, a Bayesian filter correlates the above attributes with
tags. I think there&#039;s a real chance that patterns would emerge which, if not
leading to automation, would provide an improving level of assistance.

The time delta attribute is valuable in determining batches. Within a batch,
defined by a set of photos shot within a specified time frame, the tags will
tend to be the same.

Thanks,
Kent]]></description>
