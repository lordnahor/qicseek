<h3>Travel Information</h3>

<p> Options for reaching Shenzhen proper: </p>

<ul>
<li> Direct flight to Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport. <br>
     Here is the website of Shenzhen international airport http://eng.szairport.com/. 
     However, only some Asian cities like Singapore, Tokyo, Taipei, Seoul and Bangkok 
     have direct airlines to Shenzhen. <br>
<li> Fly to Hong Kong International Airport and then take an airport coach to Shenzhen. 
     The bus journey takes about 40 mins. <br> 
     Please refer to the following - <a href="http://www.hongkongairport.com/CBT/Controller?locale=eng">click here</a> - for the 
     transportation connection between Hong Kong international airport and mainland China.
     The following - <a href="http://www.hongkongairport.com/CBT/Itinerary?actionType=list&locale=eng&locType=c&locCode=sz&arr_dep=D&locations=SZ&operation=&deptDate=&schehr1=00&schemin1=00&schehr2=23&schemin2=59">click here</a> - shows all coaches and ferries from Hong Kong airport to Shenzhen. Actually,
     many good hotels can be directly reached by the coaches, it is very possible that 
     one of them will be our conference venue. So this could be the most convenient way 
     for many people. <br>
<li> One-stop flight to Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport by Beijing or Shanghai 
     International Airport This could also be good. For instance, there are around 20 
     flights from Beijing to Shenzhen every day. 
</ul>

<h3>Visas</h3>

 <div class="content clearfix">
      <p>Please remember that visas are needed for most non-Chinese nationals to enter China (exceptions are passport holders from Singapore, Brunei, and Japan). Application should be made to the Chinese Embassy/Consulate in your country of residence, no later than four weeks before your departure. There are two types of visas:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tourist Visa (L Visa):</b>  A visa for tourism. You should check with the Chinese Embassy/Consulate in your country of residency to determine the local rules that apply for your tourist visa application. You may need to show evidence of bookings for your return flights and hotel.  Alternatively, you may need to provide an official letter of invitation.  <a href="invitation-letter-request">This letter will be sent to you upon request</a>.<br />
<!-- A visa for tourism. We have been advised that changes in the rules may make this type of visa inappropriate. Ask if it is applicable to you.  Simplest is to apply for a tourist ("L") visa, which allows enough time to attend the conference and participate in pre/post conference activities.  <!- Most attendees should apply for a Tourist Visa. Please contact your closest Chines Embassy or Consulate for instructions. - An official invitation letter is NOT required. The regular processing time is 4-5 working days. Please plan ahead to allow enough time for visa processing. --><!-- A visa for tourism. We have been advised that changes in the rules may make this type of visa inappropriate.
