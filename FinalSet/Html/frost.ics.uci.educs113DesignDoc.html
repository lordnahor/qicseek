Design Document Structure

</CENTER>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

The Design Document is a critical factor in determining the
success of your efforts to create a computer game.
With commercial games, it is often created over a period
of many months, and is a "living" document, updated as
the game is developed.
For this course, your Design Document will probably describe a larger
and more complex game than you will be able to implement by
finals week.  That's perfectly OK, but you should indicate clearly
what parts you plan to accomplish.

<p>
Your Design Document will be a web document.
You should use HTML, PDF, or another universally readable format.
Don't break your Design Document into separate pages with different URLs.
<p>

Your Design Document should have four major components:
the Overview,
the Game Specification,
the Technical Specification,
and the Schedule.
In addition, an essential component of your document is
careful proofreading.  Look for misspelled wrods, awkward
grammer, needless repetitions, unstated assumptions,
vague assertions, needless repetitions, and omissions
important features.  Every member of the team should have
carefully read the document before it is considered final.

<!--

No table of contents.

Overview should be first page, no more than one page
(Google Docs? Try print preview.)

Don't include <i>this</i> document in your design doc.

<h3> Overview (Executive Summary)</h3>

The goal of this section is to
give the reader, in a single page, a clear understanding
of who is making the game and what your game is all about.
A person who reads just this section should be able to
form an accurate mental picture of the game.
<p>
Make sure this section is a single page, and has the following
structure:
<ol>
<li>Name of the game
<li>Name of the team
<li>Names of team members
<li>Overview of game, including (as appropriate)
	<ul>
	<li>description of game play, key features, win conditions;
	<li>genre and important influences;
	<li>outline of background story;
	<li>art design;
	<li>technical platform.
	</ul>
</ol>


<h3> Game Specification</h3>

The Game Spec section serves as a "rule book" for the game.
It describes the types of interactions the player can have with
the game.
It should be fairly easy for a writer to turn the Game Specs
into a manual that could be included with the game.
The nature of the Game Specs is somewhat dependent on the type
of game being developed.
I'll give examples and descriptions for four genres of games,
top-down shooters (TDS), driving sims (DS), first-person shooters
(FPS), and role-playing games (RPG).

<UL>
<LI>
<b>Rules and mechanics.</b>
This is often an extensive section, and may need to be divided
into subsections.
For any type of game, explain how the game ends or is finished.
<b>TDS:</b> How ships/tanks/units move,
the types of weapons they have, how damage or
hit points are calculated.
<b>DS:</b> The physics of the world, how the car / vehicle is controlled,
race rules, information about brakes, tracks, surfaces, parts, etc.
<b>FPS:</b> How damage or hit points are calculated, how the protagonist moves,
types of weapons and their capabilities.
<b>RPG:</b> Rules for creating characters, their stats, skills, special powers.
How inventory, buying/selling works.

<LI>
<b>Artwork and user interface.</b> For all types of games, show
screen shots, sketches, prototypes, samples.
Describe the overall "look and feel" of the game.
<b>FPS:</b> Often tries to "shoot" for the sense of
having no user interface.
But there always is one, right?

<LI>
<b>Gameplay and balance.</b> What can the player(s) do? See?
Hear? How does
he or she interact with the game world? How are weapons or other
tools acquired, used, lost?
What are the puzzles that have to be solved?
Does left click mean something different than right click?
What kind of physics model, if any, is being used?
Describe how the game is
designed so that whatever options the user chooses, the game is
still interesting and playable.
<!--
<b>TDS:</b>
<b>DS:</b>
<b>FPS:</b>
<b>RPG:</b>
-->

<LI>
<b>Music and sound.</b>
Even the simplest music and most rudimentary sound effects add
immensely to the pleasure and "immersiveness" of playing a game.
It may be hard to describe the music and sound you plan to have,
but you should describe where the music and sound will come from.
List important sound effects.

<LI>
<b>Background story.</b>
<b>DS:</b> Often sketchy or non-existent.
<b>TDS, FPS:</b> Typically fairly simple.
<b>RPG:</b> Usually quite complex, with many side-stories.  Should
integrate closely with the artwork, the characters, and the levels.

<LI>
<b>Characters.</b> This section might be integrated with examples and
sketches of artwork.
Discuss both the characters the player can play, if any, and the
NPCs the player will encounter.
<b>TDS:</b> Spaceships, asteroids.
<b>DS:</b> Other racers, pace car, police.
<b>FPS:</b> Usually a variety of monsters, aliens, and bad guys.
<b>RPG:</b> Every NPC should be described, his/her/its background,
skills, powers, possessions. useful knowledge.
For important characters, this should be a "character bible."

<LI>
<b>Levels.</b> These are the phases of the games.
They have a variety of names:
<b>TDS:</b> Levels.
<b>DS:</b> Locations, tracks.
<b>FPS:</b> Missions.
<b>RPG:</b> Quests.
Describe the story, goals, interactions, etc. of several levels.
If your levels have puzzles or secrets, describe those.
For some games, a storyboard is an extremely useful way of
communicating the action in a level.
Briefly describe several levels, if appropriate,
and give a large amount of detail about a single one you plan to implement
this quarter.

<LI>
<b>Scripts.</b> There are several kinds of scripts:
lines for voice actors to speak,
text for text-based interfaces, and programming scripts for
controlling the action and behavior of some objects or characters.
(If you have all three of these, you may want to break them out
into separate sections.)
<b>TDS:</b> Typically little.
<b>DS:</b> Some, e.g. bridge and traffic light controls.  Before
and after race sequences.
<b>FPS:</b> Interactions with monsters, guards, minor non-adversarial
characters.
<b>RPG:</b> Extensive.  Ideally, the exact text of dialogs will
be presented in the Design Document.

<LI>
<b>Cut scenes.</b> If you plan to have non-interactive sections
of the game, at the beginning, the middle, or the end, describe these
in detail.

<LI>
<b>Artificial Intelligence.</b>
How do NPC's, enemies, and followers behave?

</UL>

<h3>Technical Specs</h3>

In "real life" the Technical Specs are hundreds of pages long.
They take all the rules from the Game Specs and make them
specific, unambiguous, and implementable.
When writing the Technical Specs, think through implications,
exceptions, exact limits.
For instance, if the the Game Specs say "The player will be
able to make the car move faster by pressing the up arrow key,"
the Technical Specs should elaborate: "Each press of the up arrow
key causes the car's speed to be multiplied by 1.01, up to a
maximum of 500 and down to a minimum of -100 (reverse)."
For this example, you'd need to explain also exactly how the user
shifts between forward and reverse.

<P>
The Technical Specs should also discuss or include:

<UL>

<LI> Programming languages, including compiler and emulator.

<LI> Libraries that will be used.

<LI> Any code or engines to be used.  If you plan to use
a game engine, describe it and explain what its
interface (to the rest of the system) is.

<LI> Target hardware and Operating System.

<LI> Data Structures, or better, interfaces of ADTs and classes.
A list of all (C++/Java/C#) classes and their interfaces is
appropriate in this section.

<LI> Exact algorithms.  If an NPC "knows" how to walk back and
forth between to positions, avoiding a large rock in between,
discuss the AI algorithm (or script) that will be used.

<LI> Back-up and version control plans.  You don't want to lose
40 hours of work in tenth week!


</UL>


<h3> Schedule and Personnel</h3>

It's important that each member of the team have a clear set
of responsibilities, and a clear time-line for various tasks.

You should include the following:

<UL>

<LI> Deliverables as of the end of seventh week, Friday, February 21.

<LI> Deliverables as of the end of ninth week, Friday, March 7.

<LI> Deliverables as of the end of the project, Friday, March 14.

</UL>

As far as possible, state the deliverables by team member.
Structure the sequence of your deliverables
so that core art and gameplay comes first, and extra features,
levels, characters, puzzles, AI, etc., are scheduled later.
You should plan on having a playable mini-version of your game
by February 28.

<P>

For each team member, state the role(s) he or she will play in
the project, and what contributions he or she will make to the
final game.  Also include a statement from each team member
about what he or she needs to learn in the remainder of the
course.

<P>
If you are working with people who are not enrolled in this course,
you should mention them and explain their roles.
In particular, if you are working with artists and include
any of their artwork, make sure to give them credit.
