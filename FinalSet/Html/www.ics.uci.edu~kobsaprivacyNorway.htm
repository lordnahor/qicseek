NAME="ch2"></A>Chapter II General rules for the processing of personal data 
</H4>
<H4><a name="sec8"></a>Section 8 Conditions for the processing of personal data </H4>
<P>Personal data (cf. section 2, no. 1) may only be processed if the data
subject has consented thereto, or there is statutory authority for such
processing, or the processing is necessary in order <BR>
a) to fulfil a contract to which the data subject is party, or to take steps at
the request of the data subject prior to entering into such a contract, <BR>
b) to enable the controller to fulfil a legal obligation, <BR>
c) to protect the vital interests of the data subject, <BR>
d) to perform a task in the public interest, <BR>
e) to exercise official authority, or <BR>
f) to enable the controller or third parties to whom the data are disclosed to
protect a legitimate interest, except where such interest is overridden by the
interests of the data subject. </P>
<H4><a name="sec9"></a>Section 9 Processing of sensitive personal data </H4>
<P>Sensitive personal data (cf. section 2, no.8) may only be processed if the
processing satisfies one of the conditions set out in section 8 and <BR>
a) the data subject consents to the processing, <BR>
b) there is statutory authority for such processing, <BR>
c) the processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of a person, and
the data subject is incapable of giving his or her consent, <BR>
d) the processing relates exclusively to data which the data subject has
voluntarily and manifestly made public, <BR>
e) the processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of a
legal claim, <BR>
f) the processing is necessary to enable the controller to fulfil his
obligations or exercise his rights in the field of employment law, <BR>
g) the processing is necessary for the purposes of preventive medicine, medical
diagnosis, the provision of care or treatment or the management of health care
services, and where the data are processed by health professionals subject to
the obligation of professional secrecy, or <BR>
h) the processing is necessary for historical, statistical or scientific
purposes, and the public interest in such processing being carried out clearly
exceeds the disadvantages it might entail for the natural person. </P>
<P>Non-profit associations and foundations may process sensitive personal data
in the course of their activities even if such processing does not satisfy one
of the conditions laid down in the first paragraph, litra a-h. Such processing
may apply solely to data relating to members or to persons who, on account of
the purposes of the association or foundation, voluntarily have regular contact
with it, and solely to data which are collected through such contact. The
personal data may not be disclosed without the consent of the data subject. 
</P>
<P>The Data Inspectorate may decide that sensitive personal data may also be
processed in other cases if this is warranted by important public interests and
steps are taken to protect the interests of the data subject. </P>
<H4>Section 10 Register of criminal convictions </H4>
<P>A complete register of criminal convictions may only be kept under the
control of official authority. </P>
<H4><a name="sec11"></a>Section 11 Basic requirements for the processing of personal data </H4>
<P>The controller shall ensure that personal data which are processed <BR>
a) are processed only when this is authorized pursuant to sections 8 and 9,
<BR>
b) are used only for explicitly stated purposes that are objectively justified
by the activities of the controller, <BR>
c) are not used subsequently for purposes that are incompatible with the
original purpose of the collection, without the consent of the data subject,
<BR>
d) are adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose of the
processing, and <BR>
e) are accurate and up-to-date, and are not stored longer than is necessary for
the purpose of the processing, cf. sections 27 and 28. </P>
<P>Subsequent processing of personal data for historical, statistical or
scientific purposes is not deemed to be incompatible with the original purposes
of the collection of the data, cf. first paragraph, litra c, if the public
interest in the processing being carried out clearly exceeds the disadvantages
this may entail for natural persons. </P>
<H4>Section 12 Use of personal identity numbers, etc.</H4>
<P> Personal identity numbers and other clear means of identification may only
be used in the processing when there is a objective need for certain
identification and the method is necessary to achieve such identification. </P>
<P>The Data Inspectorate may require a controller to use such means of
identification as are mentioned in the first paragraph to ensure that the
personal data are of adequate quality. </P>
<P>The King may by regulations prescribe further rules regarding the use of
personal identity numbers and other clear means of identification. </P>
<H4><a name="sec13"></a>Section 13 Data security </H4>
<P>The controller and the processor shall by means of planned, systematic
measures ensure satisfactory data security with regard to confidentiality,
integrity and accessibility in connection with the processing of personal data.
</P>
<P>To achieve satisfactory data security, the controller and processor shall
document the data system and the security measures. Such documentation shall be
accessible to the employees of the controller and of the processor. The
documentation shall also be accessible to the Data Inspectorate and the Privacy
Appeals Board. </P>
<P>Any controller who allows other persons to have access to personal data,
e.g. a processor or other persons performing tasks in connection with the data
system, shall ensure that the said persons fulfil the requirements set out in
the first and second paragraphs. </P>
<P>The King may prescribe regulations regarding data security in connection
with the processing of personal data, including further rules regarding
organisational and technical security measures. </P>
<H4>Section 14 Internal control </H4>
<P>The controller shall establish and maintain such planned and systematic
measures as are necessary to fulfil the requirements laid down in or pursuant
to this Act, including measures to ensure the quality of personal data. </P>
<P>The controller shall document the measures. The documentation shall be
accessible to the employees of the controller and of the processor. The
documentation shall also be accessible to the Data Inspectorate and the Privacy
Appeals Board. </P>
<P>The King may prescribe regulations containing further rules regarding
internal control. </P>
<H4>Section 15 The processor's right of disposition over personal data </H4>
<P>No processor may process personal data in any way other than that which is
agreed in writing with the controller. Nor may the data be turned over to
another person for storage or manipulation without such agreement. </P>
<P>It shall also be stated in the agreement with the controller that the
processor undertakes to carry out such security measures as ensue from section
13. </P>
<H4>Section 16 Time limit for replying to inquiries regarding data, etc. </H4>
<P>The controller shall reply to inquiries regarding access or other rights
pursuant to sections 18, 22, 25, 26, 27 and 28 without undue delay and not
later than 30 days from the date of receipt of the inquiry. </P>
<P>If special circumstances should make it impossible to reply to the inquiry
within 30 days, implementation may be postponed until it is possible to reply.
In such case, the controller shall give a provisional reply stating the reason
for the delay and when a reply is likely to be given. </P>
<H4>Section 17 Payment </H4>
<P>The controller may not request compensation for providing data pursuant to
Chapter III or for meeting demands of the data subject pursuant to Chapter IV.

NAME="ch3"></A>Chapter III Information on processing of personal data</H4>
<H4><a name="sec18"></a>Section 18 Right of access </H4>
<P>Any person who so requests shall be informed of the kind of processing of
personal data a controller is performing, and may demand to receive the
following information as regards a specific type of processing: <BR>
a) the name and address of the controller and of his representative, if any,
<BR>
b) who has the day-to-day responsibility for fulfilling the obligations of the
controller, <BR>
c) the purpose of the processing, <BR>
d) descriptions of the categories of personal data that are processed, <BR>
e) the sources of the data, and <BR>
f) whether the personal data will be disclosed, and if so, the identity of the
recipient. If the person requesting access is a data subject, the controller
shall inform him of <BR>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>a) the categories of data concerning the data subject that are
being processed, and <BR>
b) the security measures implemented in connection with the processing insofar
as such access does not prejudice security. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The data subject may demand that the controller elaborate on the information
in the first paragraph, litra a-f to the extent that this is necessary to
enable the data subject to protect his or her own interests. </P>
<P>The right to information pursuant to the second and third paragraphs shall
not apply if the personal data are being processed exclusively for historical,
statistical or scientific purposes and the processing will have no direct
significance for the data subject. </P>
<H4><a name="sec19"></a>Section 19 Obligation to provide information when data is collected from
the data subject </H4>
<P>When personal data is collected from the data subject himself, the
controller shall on his own initiative first inform the data subject of <BR>
a) the name and address of the controller and of his representative, if any
<BR>
b) the purpose of the processing, <BR>
c) whether the data will be disclosed and if so, the identity of the recipient,
<BR>
d) the fact that the provision of data is voluntary, and <BR>
e) any other circumstances that will enable the data subject to exercise his
rights pursuant to this Act in the best possible way, such as information on
the right to demand access to data, cf. section 18, and the right to demand
that data be rectified, cf. sections 27 and 28. </P>
<P>Notification is not required if there is no doubt that the data subject
already has the information in the first paragraph. </P>
<H4><a name="sec20"></a>Section 20 Obligation to provide information when data is collected from
persons other than the data subject </H4>
<P>A controller who collects personal data from persons other than the data
subject shall on his own initiative inform the data subject of which data are
being collected and provide such information as is mentioned in section 19,
first paragraph, as soon as the data have been obtained. If the purpose of
collecting the data is to communicate them to other persons, the controller may
wait to notify the data subject until such disclosure takes place. </P>
<P>The data subject is not entitled to notification pursuant to the first
paragraph if <BR>
a) the collection or communication of data is expressly authorized by statute,
<BR>
b) notification is impossible or disproportionately difficult, or <BR>
c) there is no doubt that the data subject already has the information which
shall be contained in the notification. </P>
<P>When notification is omitted pursuant to litra b, the information shall
nonetheless be provided at the latest when the data subject is contacted on the
basis of the data. </P>
<H4><a name="sec21"></a>Section 21 Obligation to provide information in connection with the use of
personal profiles </H4>
<P>When a person contacts the data subject or makes decisions to which the data
subject is subject on the basis of personal profiles that are intended to
describe behaviour, preferences, abilities or needs, for instance in connection
with marketing activities, the controller shall inform the data subject of <BR>
a) the identity of the controller, <BR>
b) the categories of data which are being used, and <BR>
c) the sources of the data. </P>
<H4><a name="sec22"></a>Section 22 Right to information regarding automated decisions </H4>
<P>If a decision has legal or another significant effects for the data subject
and is based solely on automated processing of personal data, the data subject
who is subject to the decision may demand that the controller give an account
of the rules incorporated in the computer software which form the basis for the
decision. </P>
<H4><a name="sec23"></a>Section 23 Exceptions to the right to information </H4>
<P>The right to access pursuant to sections 18 and 22 and the obligation to
provide information pursuant to sections 19, 20 and 21 do not encompass data
<BR>
a) which, if known, might endanger national security, national defence or the
relationship to foreign powers or international organizations, <BR>
b) regarding which secrecy is required in the interests of the prevention,
investigation, exposure and prosecution of criminal acts, <BR>
c) which it must be regarded as inadvisable for the data subject to gain
knowledge of, out of consideration for the health of the person concerned or
for the relationship to persons close to the person concerned, <BR>
d) to which a statutory obligation of professional secrecy applies, <BR>
e) which are solely to be found in texts drawn up for internal preparatory
purposes and which have not been disclosed to other persons, <BR>
f) regarding which it will be contrary to obvious and fundamental private or
public interests to provide information, including the interests of the data
subject himself. </P>
<P>Data pursuant to the first paragraph, litra c, may nonetheless on request be
made known to a representative of the data subject when there are no special
reasons for not doing so. Any person who refuses to provide access to data
pursuant to the first paragraph must give the reason for this in writing with a
precise reference to the provision governing exceptions. </P>
<P>The King may prescribe regulations regarding other exceptions from the right
of access and the obligation to provide information and regarding conditions
for the use of right of access. </P>
<H4>Section 24 How the information shall be provided </H4>
<P>The information may requested in writing from the controller or from his
processor as mentioned in section 15. Before providing access to data relating
to a data subject, the controller may require that the data subject furnish a
written, signed request. </P>

NAME="ch4"></A>Chapter IV Other rights of the data subject</H4>
<H4>Section 25 Right to demand manual processing </H4>
<P>Any person who is subject to a fully automated decision such as is mentioned
in section 22 or to whom the case otherwise directly relates may demand that
the decision be reviewed by a physical person. </P>
<P>The right pursuant to the first paragraph shall not apply if the data
subject's interests in terms of protection of privacy are adequately
safeguarded and the decision is authorized by statute or is related to the
performance of a contract. </P>
<H4><a name="sec26"></a>Section 26 Right to be excluded from direct marketing </H4>
<P>The King may prescribe regulations regarding a central marketing exclusion
register with further rules governing the register. </P>
<P>The data subject may demand that his name be blocked as regards use in
direct marketing, irrespective of the medium. Such blocking may be demanded in
both the central marketing exclusion register and in the marketer's register of
addresses. </P>
<P>Controllers who engage in direct marketing shall update their register of
addresses in relation to the central marketing exclusion register prior to
sending out mailings for the first time and at least four times yearly. </P>
<P>Any person who receives direct advertising shall be informed as to who
provided the personal data on which the mailing was based. </P>
<P>The right to request blocking in the central marketing exclusion register
does not apply to marketing of the products of controllers with whom the data
subject has a current customer relationship. </P>
<P><b><a name="sec27"></a>Section 27 Rectification of deficient personal data</b> </P>
<P>If personal data which are inaccurate or incomplete or of which processing
is not authorized, the controller shall on his own initiative or at the request
of the data subject rectify the deficient data. The controller shall if
possible ensure that the error does not have an effect on the data subject, for
instance by notifying recipients of disclosed data. </P>
<P>The rectification of inaccurate or incomplete personal data which may be of
significance as documentation shall be effected by marking the data clearly and
supplementing them with accurate data. </P>
<P>If weighty considerations relating to protection of privacy so warrant, the
Data Inspectorate may, notwithstanding the second paragraph, decide that
rectification shall be effected by erasing or blocking the deficient personal
data. If the data may not be destroyed pursuant to the Archives Act, the
Director General of the National Archives of Norway shall be consulted prior to
making an administrative decision regarding erasure. This decision shall take
precedence over the provisions of sections 9 and 18 of the Archives Act of 4
December 1992 No. 126. </P>
<P>Erasure should be supplemented by the recording of accurate and complete
data. If this is impossible, and the document which contained the erased data
therefore provides a clearly misleading picture, the entire document shall be
erased. </P>
<P>The King may prescribe regulations containing supplementary provisions as
regards how to effect rectification. </P>
<H4><a name="sec28"></a>Section 28 Prohibition against storing unnecessary personal data </H4>
<P>The controller shall not store personal data longer than is necessary to
carry out the purpose of the processing. If the personal data shall not
thereafter be stored in pursuance of the Archives Act or other legislation,
they shall be erased. </P>
<P>The controller may, notwithstanding the first paragraph, store personal data
for historical, statistical or scientific purposes, if the public interest in
the data being stored clearly exceeds the disadvantages this may entail for the
person concerned. In this case, the controller shall ensure that the data are
not stored in ways which make it possible to identify the data subject longer
than necessary. </P>
<P><a name="sec28-1"></a>The data subject may demand that data which are strongly disadvantageous to
him or her shall be blocked or erased if this <BR>
a) is not contrary to another statute, and <BR>
b) is justifiable on the basis of an overall assessment of, inter alia the
needs of other persons for documentation, the interests of the data subject,
cultural historical interests and the resources required to carry out the
demand. </P>
<P>After the Director General of the National Archives of Norway has been
consulted, the Data Inspectorate may decide that the right to erase data
pursuant to the third paragraph shall take precedence over the provisions of
sections 9 and 18 of the Archives Act of 4 December 1992 No. 126. </P>
<P>If the document which contained the erased data gives a clearly misleading
picture after the erasure, the entire document shall be erased. </P>

NAME="ch5"></A>Chapter V Transfer of personal data to other countries</H4>
<H4>Section 29 Basic conditions </H4>
<P>Personal data may only be transferred to countries which ensure an adequate
level of protection of the data. Countries which have implemented Directive
95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of
personal data and on the free movement of such data meet the requirement as
regards an adequate level of protection. </P>
<P>In assessing the adequacy of the level of protection, emphasis shall be
placed, inter alia on the nature of the data, the purpose and duration of the
proposed processing and the rules of law and the professional rules and
security measures which apply in the country in question. Importance shall also
be attached to whether the country has acceded to the Council of Europe's
Convention No. 108 of 28 January 1981 on the protection of individuals with
regard to the automatic processing of personal data. </P>
<H4>Section 30 Exceptions </H4>
<P>Personal data may also be transferred to countries which do not ensure an
adequate level of protection if <BR>
a) the data subject has consented to the transfer, <BR>
b) there is an obligation to transfer the data pursuant to an international
agreement or as a result of membership of an international organization, <BR>
c) the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract with the data
subject, or for the performance of tasks at the request of the data subject
prior to entering into such a contract, <BR>
d) the transfer is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract
with a third party in the interest of the data subject, <BR>
e) the transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the
data subject, <BR>
f) the transfer is necessary in order to establish, exercise or defend a legal
claim, <BR>
g) the transfer is necessary or legally required in order to protect an
important public interest, or <BR>
h) there is statutory authority for demanding data from a public register. </P>
<P>The Data Inspectorate may allow transfer even if the conditions of the first
paragraph are not fulfilled if the controller provides adequate safeguards with
respect to the protection of the rights of the data subject. The Data
Inspectorate may stipulate conditions for the transfer. </P>
<P>The King may prescribe regulations regarding the transfer of personal data
to another country, including regarding stopping or limiting transfers to
specified countries which do not satisfy the requirements set out in section
29. </P>

NAME="ch6"></A>Chapter VI Obligation to give notification and to obtain a
licence</H4>
<H4>Section 31 Obligation to give notification </H4>
<P>The controller shall notify the Data Inspectorate before <BR>
a) processing personal data by automatic means <BR>
b) establishing a manual personal data filing system which contains sensitive
personal data. </P>
<P>Notification shall be given not later than 30 days prior to commencement of
processing. The Data Inspectorate shall give the controller a receipt of
notification. </P>
<P>New notification must be given prior to processing that exceeds the limits
for processing provided for in section 32. Even if no changes have taken place,
new notification shall be given three years after the previous notification was
given. </P>
<P>The King may prescribe regulations to the effect that certain methods of
processing or controllers are exempted from the obligation to give
notification, subject to a simplified obligation to give notification or
subject to an obligation to obtain a licence. For processing that is exempt
from the obligation to give notification, regulations may be prescribed to
limit the disadvantages that processing otherwise may entail for the data
subject. </P>
<H4>Section 32 Content of the notification </H4>
<P>The notification shall provide information regarding <BR>
a) the name and address of the controller and his representative and processor,
if any, <BR>
b) when the processing will begin, <BR>
c) who has the day-to-day responsibility for fulfilling the obligations of the
controller, <BR>
d) the purpose of the processing, <BR>
e) an overview of the categories of personal data that are to be processed,
<BR>
f) the sources of the personal data, <BR>
g) the legal basis for collecting the data, <BR>
h) the persons to whom the personal data will be disclosed, including
recipients in other countries, if any, and <BR>
i) the security measures relating to the processing. </P>
<P>The King may prescribe regulations regarding the data which notifications
shall contain and the implementation of the obligation to give notification. 
</P>
<H4>Section 33 Obligation to obtain a licence </H4>
<P>A licence from the Data Inspectorate is required for the processing of
sensitive personal data. This does not apply, however, to the processing of
sensitive personal data which have been volunteered by the data subject. </P>
<P>The Data Inspectorate may decide that the processing of data other than
sensitive personal data shall also be subject to licensing, if such processing
otherwise will clearly violate weighty interests relating to protection of
privacy. In assessing whether a licence is necessary, the Data Inspectorate
shall, inter alia take account of the nature and quantity of the personal data
and the purpose of the processing. </P>
<P>The controller may demand that the Data Inspectorate decide whether
processing will be subject to licensing. </P>
<P>The obligation to obtain a licence pursuant to the first and second
paragraphs shall not apply to the processing of personal data in central
government or municipal bodies when such processing is authorized by special
statute. </P>
<P>The King may prescribe regulations to the effect that certain processing
methods are not subject to licensing pursuant to the first paragraph. As

disadvantages are offset by considerations that favour the processing. </P>
<H4>Section 35 Conditions laid down in the licence </H4>
