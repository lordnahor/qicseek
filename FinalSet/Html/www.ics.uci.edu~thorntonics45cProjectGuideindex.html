<p class="title">Introduction</p>

<p>This quarter, much of your focus will be on the programming projects found here.  Being a course in C++ programming, all of these projects will be written entirely in C++; they are designed to expose you to a variety of concepts and techniques that are important in C++, and to prepare you for later coursework in ICS, such as ICS 46.</p>

<p>I do not assume that any of you will have previous C++ experience, though I do expect that all of you have at least a year or so of introductory programming experience in some language other than C++.  For a lot of you, that will have been our first-year sequence in Python; others will have taken our previous first-year sequence in Java, or introductory courses in other places in any of a variety of programming languages.  In general, if you have some experience programming in <i>something</i>, you'll be fine, provided that you're willing to put in the time and effort to learn something new, especially something that might look and feel quite different from what you're accustomed to.  The most important thing when learning a new programming language is to form an understanding of the appropriate idioms the new language provides, as opposed to attempting a line-for-line translation from the language you prefer to the language you're learning.</p>

<p>Note that C++ programming requires a level of care and attention to detail that exceeds what you may have experienced in languages you've used previously, requiring a dual focus on both higher-level abstractions and low-level implementation details that many languages hide and/or handle automatically.  Focusing on the small details of the code you write is more important than it is in many other languages.  Debugging can be more of an adventure, given that program crashes will not necessarily be accompanied with the clarity of diagnostics to which you've become accustomed.  For these reasons, it's important to start your work <i>early</i>, encounter problems <i>early</i>, and get questions asked and answered <i>early</i>.  Many of the most perplexing debugging problems I've ever faced in my professional career were in C++ programs, and having enough time to get these kinds of issues resolved may well be the difference between finishing your work or not.</p>

<p>While prior C++ (or C) experience is neither required nor assumed, it doesn't hurt; however, if you have prior experience, especially in C, you may find that some of the practices you've learned in the past are not acceptable in this course.  We're focused not just on writing programs that generate the correct output, but at least as importantly on techniques that modularize programs, manage and hide complexity, and generally make the best use of what C++ has to offer, above and beyond what is provided by its C heritage.  (It's important to realize that, while C and C++ share a common lineage, they have diverged in a number of ways in the last couple of decades; be aware that our focus here is squarely on C++, not C.)  We'll start with some of the baseline concepts first &mdash; and ignore a lot of the higher-level abstractions &mdash; but will quickly realize that writing clear C++ programs requires avoiding the manual, error-prone techniques as often as possible.</p>

<p class="title">Evaluation of your work</p>

<p class="subtitle">Evaluation criteria</p>

<p>Each of your projects will be graded on a 30-point scale, with the points split (albeit unevenly) into two categories: <i>correctness and robustness</i> (i.e., does the program work?) and <i>quality and design</i> (i.e., how well is the program written?).  They are described in more detail below.</p>

<table class="normal">
  <tr class="top">
    <td>Criteria</td>
    <td>Value</td>
    <td>Description</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Correctness&nbsp;and&nbsp;robustness</td>

        <li><i>Summary: Does the program do what it's supposed to do for any input that meets the project specifications?</i></li>
        <li>When the program is given valid input, does it generate the output specified?</li>
        <li>Is the output spacing and case correct, if these are specified?</li>
        <li>When the program is given unusual or erroneous input, and the project write-up doesn't specifically forbid us from testing it, is it handled gracefully?</li>
        <li>Are all resources allocated by the program (e.g., memory, open files) released before the program ends?</li>

<p class="subtitle">Code that does not compile</p>

<p>If you submit a program that does not compile, we will not be able to execute it and, thus, will not be able to evaluate its correctness.  It is your responsibility to turn in code that compiles, and it's important that it compiles in the development environment specified for this course &mdash; more about that below.  Though we will make an honest effort to assess its overall correctness and quality, we can, at our discretion, assign a score as low as zero to a program that does not compile, and you can assume that your score on such a program will not necessarily apporach the percentage of completeness and correctness you actually achieved, as it is impossible for us to measure that without being able to run and test your program.</p>

<p>At the level of experience that is assumed of you, you should be able to ensure that code compiles, even in a partially-completed program; you should be able to work incrementally, save copies when you reach stable state, and so on.  You might also consider using a source control tool like <a href="git-scm.com">Git</a>, which helps you to formalize this kind of incremental work, though this is not required.  If you've never used a source control tool before, it would be worth the effort spent to learn about one; given its flexibility and popularity in professional and open source circles, Git is a very good choice.  If you prefer something else, feel free to use it.  (Git is installed on the ICS 45C VM, but you can install other systems on to the VM pretty easily if you're so inclined.)</p>

<p class="subtitle">Late work</p>

<p>Things happen and ten-week quarters can be unforgiving.  It's not unreasonable to expect that you may find it difficult to finish one of the projects on time, even if you're on top of things most of the time.  I get emails often from students, saying things like <i>If I just had one more day to work on this, I'd get it done!</i>  On the other hand, being consistently behind is a recipe for struggle in this course; we'll be moving quickly, and it will be progressively harder to catch up the farther behind you get.</p>

<p>The best balance between these two realities is that everyone is allowed to have a tough time with a project once this quarter &mdash; maybe you underestimated the difficulty of an assignment, maybe you have three midterms and a paper due the same day, maybe you have a sudden outside commitment that can't be avoided.  For this reason, I'm offering the following late work policy:</p>

<p><i>Each student is permitted to submit any one project up to 48 hours late, with no questions asked about why and no prior notification required.</i></p>

<p>For the purposes of clarification, here are some additional details about how this policy works:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You are not required to notify us in advance &mdash; in fact, in all honesty, we'd prefer that you didn't.  (There are a lot of students in this course, so that would represent a lot of extra work for us.)  We'll be looking for submissions up to 48 hours beyond the deadline of each project.</li>
  <li>There is a ten-minute grace period after the due date, allowing you time to get your files submitted to Checkmate.  If you submitted your files at 12:08am for an 11:59pm due date, you're fine.  Best not to play with fire, though, if you're already done before 11:59pm; at 12:11am, you'll have used up your one-time extension.  <i>No exceptions!</i></li>
  <li>The first project that you submit late will fall under this policy; any subsequent project you submit late will not be accepted.  (In other words, you can't submit two projects late, then wait to see which one you get a better score on; we won't be grading the second one.)</li>
  <li>If any one file is submitted beyond the ten-minute grace period, the entire project is considered late.</li>
</ul>

<p>We'll be tracking this throughout the quarter and, of course, will not grant the extension to anyone more than once.  But this should accommodate the unforeseen issues that might otherwise prevent you from finishing a project on time.</p>

<p>Other than this, late work is not accepted in this course.</p>

<p>Out-of-the-ordinary circumstances sometimes warrant exceptions to this policy; if you are faced with a problem that is preventing you from getting your work done on time, either on a single assignment or chronically, please contact me and we can talk about how best to approach the problem.  It's important to contact me sooner rather than later; earlier in the quarter, there are a lot more things I can do to help than there are in the tenth week.</p>

<p class="title">Development environment</p>

<p>Unlike programming languages such as Java or Python, which make it a point to be (more or less) independent of the platform (i.e., the hardware, the operating system, etc.) that they run on, C++ is decidedly <i>platform-dependent</i>.  This is especially true in the last couple of years or so, as a new version of the C++ Standard, called C++11, has been released, but not all compiler implementers have implemented all of the new features of the language yet (and library support is even more hit-or-miss).  And even amongst the features that all compilers share, there are differences &mdash; all the way down to details such as the maximum value you can store in a variable of type <b>int</b>! &mdash; that make it important for us to agree on a single development environment: a particular compiler running on a particular operating system.</p>

<p>Because not every one of you will be running the same operating system on your own machine, and to avoid the problem of having each of you install and configure the necessary software yourselves, the officially-supported development environment for ICS 45C is provided in the form of a <i>virtual machine</i>, a complete environment that includes an operating system, compiler, debugger, text editors, and so on; we'll call this the <i>ICS 45C VM</i>.  Rather than installing software, you'll download the ICS 45C VM and run it as an application on your computer, but log into it as though it was a separate computer.  This is explained in more detail in <a href="Project0">Project #0</a>, which describes how to download it and set it up for use.</p>

<p class="subtitle">What if I don't want to use the ICS 45C VM?</p>

<p>Everything we do this quarter will be standard C++11.  Aside from incompatibilities between compilers &mdash; both those arising from new features that are implemented by some compilers and not others, as well as platform dependencies &mdash; I would expect you to be in good shape using something else a large percentage of the time, though you'll find that you hit bumps in the road sometimes, and it may not be obvious when you do.  You may write programs that work in your environment but don't work in the provided environment; this is a realistic possibility in C++, especially when we're working with newer language features that aren't implemented in every compiler.</p>

<p>Be aware that we will be grading your work using the ICS 45C VM, so, at minimum, you should <i>always</i> test your projects in the ICS 45C VM before submitting your work.  Submitting work that compiles on your favorite compiler but not in the ICS 45C VM is viewed the same as any other work that does not compile at all; as when you work for (or with) someone else professionally, you don't always get to choose your favorite environment to work, and have to adapt to what is appropriate to the situation.  Additionally, be aware that you're on your own to get software other than the ICS 45C VM set up and configured; we can't realistically support everyone's separate home installation, whereas the ICS 45C VM gives us a single system to support.</p>

<p>Also (and especially if you've never used Linux before or spent a lot of time on a command line), you should consider the practical usefulness of learning new skills that will no doubt prove to be valuable as you pursue professional and academic options further down the line.  Trying out something new while having the safety net of a large course staff to help you is a lot better than struggling with it on your own.  Even if only for that reason, I'd strongly encourage you to use the ICS 45C VM for all of your work, even if it seems like a difficult transition at first.  Linux and command lines are an important part of real-world computing, and you would be wise to gain some experience with them.</p>

<p class="title">Submitting your projects</p>

<p>When you complete each project, you must submit it to us electronically to a web-based system called Checkmate.  Follow <a href="SubmittingProjects.html">this link</a> for a detailed description of how to submit your projects via Checkmate.  Understand that we will only accept projects submitted using the procedure described there; we <i>do not</i> accept printed copies of your projects, nor do we accept them via email <i>under any circumstances</i>.</p>

<p>You are responsible for submitting the version of your project that you want graded.  We will grade the most recent submission made before the deadline.  Accidentally submitting the wrong version will not be considered grounds for a regrade.</p>

<p class="title">Academic honesty</p>

<p class="subtitle">The policy</p>

<p>As ICS 45C or CSE 45C students, you are expected to know and follow the academic honesty policies of both the Bren School of ICS and the University as a whole.  Please take a few minutes to read the policies, which can be found at <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/#03">this link</a>.</p>

<p>All of your lab work is expected to be completed <i>solely by you</i>.  Worker in larger groups and/or sharing of code between students that are not partners is not permitted.  Note that "high-level discussion of course material for better understanding" is permitted and encouraged, but when it comes time to sit down and write code, that is expected to be done by you and you alone.  All submissions are compared to one another using an automated plagiarism detection system.  This system is extraordinarily good at finding similarities between submissions, even when there are superficial differences.  (Note that we also compare your submissions to those submitted during previous quarters whenever one of these assignments was given during a previous quarter, so it is an exceedingly bad idea to turn in, or even refer to, code written by a friend of yours who took the course already.)</p>

<p>Since all of your work is expected to be completed solely by you, you will be held responsible even if you plagiarize only a small portion of someone else's work.</p>

<p>Academic honesty is a two-way street.  Providing your code to other students for them to turn in as their own is not permitted anymore than turning in someone else's code.  Resist the temptation to give code to your friends "for reference."  Based on my experience, I can say that your "friends" may very well betray you and turn it in, anyway.</p>

<p>Naturally, the Midterm and Final Exam are also expected to be individual efforts.  Dishonest behavior during an exam will not be tolerated.</p>

<p>Violators of academic honesty policies are subject to the penalties described in the Bren School of ICS policy.  They are also subject to an immediate course grade of F, and you will not be allowed to drop the course to avoid the grade.  Also be aware that a single documented case of academic dishonesty may preclude you from switching into computing majors, registering for computing minors, joining the ICS Honors Program, and graduating from a computing major with honors.</p>

<p class="subtitle">The lesson</p>

<p>Okay, so the moral of the story is that it's wise to avoid cheating.  I believe that it's relatively rare that students enter a course with the conscious intent to cheat their way through it; why come to UCI if you're not planning to get something out of the coursework?  So why do people cheat every quarter in every course?  The answers vary, but here's the easiest way I can boil down the numerous conversations I've had with students caught cheating in my courses over the years: <i>I fell behind and couldn't figure out how to catch up</i>.  Things happen and ten-week quarters are unforgiving.  You might get sick, you might have issues crop up in your family, you might have an off-campus job that's demanding too much of your time, you might be trying to decide whether you're on the path you want to be on... Any of those things (and many others) can make it hard to keep up.  You fall a little behind, you fall a little further behind, and pretty soon the situation seems hopeless.  You're under pressure, temptation gets the better of you...</p>

<p>If you feel like you're beginning to slip off course or things are getting beyond your control, the best thing to do is to talk to us <i>sooner rather than later</i>.  We're here to help; we understand.  But the reality of taking large-sized courses at a large-sized institution is that we're not going to know you're in need unless you tell us.  If things are happening in your life, tell us; you don't have to be specific if you're not comfortable with it.  Before the fact, there's often a way to work things out.  After the fact, it's usually too late.</p>
