Dear Mr. Miller                                                    B&quot;H
    I have been meaning to write you for a very long time.  As a matter of 
	fact, I think I once spoke to you when I was in NY visiting my brother, 
	Chaiim Baruch (Harry) Schonfeld.  Anyway, we've always heard from our 
	father, Moshe, A&quot;H, and from other relatives, that we were descended from 
	the Bnei Yissoschor.v  However, noone seems to know how.  I've asked and 
	asked.  Some versions I've heard &quot;shtimt nisht&quot;.  Maybe because you've 
	done much more research than I have, and are more well versed with 
	Seforim, you would know.
    
	A 2nd cousin of mine, a Margareten (ben Hinda Schonfeld Margareten) 
	reportedly went to the Blushever, z&quot;l, andd asked him if we are related 
	to the B&quot;Y and he answered &quot;Avada&quot; (certainly). 
	
    Also, to change the subject somewhat, could you tell me about the 
	Miller-Schonfeld connection.  We had several occassions to speak with family 
	members of Pesach Dovid Schonfeld, A&quot;H, but unfortunately all those 
	occassions were when we or they were sitting Shiva.  We are related to that 
	family through 2 different connections.
    
	Anyway, here is our Yichus-please let me know what you know, and I will do 
	likewise:
 
    My father:   Moshe Schonfeld                
	           + Pesel Lifshe Goldberger (a Lisker grandchild)
      gfather    Chaim Baruch Schonfeld         
	           + Malya Weinberger
     ggfather    Naftali Yeshaya Asher Schonfeld
	           + Esther Wohl, 
	             Shprintza Shaindel Wohl (Hanucovce)
    gggfather    Menachem Mendel Schonfeld      
	           + Sora Blima ?
   ggggfather    Eliezer Schonfeld              
               + ?
 
                               Looking forward to hearing from you,
                               Elizabeth Feder

Dear Moishe,
    I did look at the website, and did not see any apparent connection.
    I can provide several tiny hints regarding the Q of our connection to
the Bnei Yissoschor, and also the dates, as you asked.  Unfortunately, these
hints have not helped me discover the answer, but nevertheless:
(1)  In talking to my father A&quot;H's first cousin, she said she thought the
connection was through the mother.  The Wohl sisters, who were wives to
Naftali Yeshaya Asher (I am named for them)  were descended from Shaul Wahl,
the Polish king for a day.  Their parents were Yaakov Yehuda and Rivka bas
Moshe Chaim (maiden name unknown) Wohl.
(2)  When I was in Israel this past summer, I met another branch of the
family for the first time.  They are descendants of Naftali's brother
Yechiel Mechel Schonfeld, who lived in Uhely.  They said they did not get
the &quot;Kabbala&quot; that their branch stems from the B&quot;Y, but were knowlegeable
that that Naftali &amp; Yechiel's uncle, Moshe, was the B&quot;Y's son-in-law.


The dates:
My father, obm Moshe Schonfeld, b. **** in Cz, d. Pesach ****
Gfather Chaim Baruch b, 1879, d. 1929
Naftali Yeshaya Asher Schonfeld b. about 1840, d. Av, 1920

Thanks,

Elizabeth Feder

This too is in process. Are you aware of the family of Naftali Yeshaye Asher
Schonfeld from Hanusovce nad Taplou? The secular documents refer to him as
Nathan, and he is also called Naftali by contemporaries. His father was
Menachem Mendel (or some variant) who is assumed to be the brother of Moshe
Schonfeld from Medzilaborce. The family has a Tzavah from NYA which states
that they are descendants of the B.Y. Not necessariyly from Moshe ben
Eliezer but from another daughter. Elizabeth Schonfeld Feder is their family
historian. Her brothers Louis Schonfeld (Yekutiel) lives in Flatbush (less
than 5 minutes away from you) and Baruch Schonfeld also from Flatbush.  I
mentioned your name to her. Also, fee free to use my "Schonfeld subscriber"
list to disseminate any relevant information you wish. All the individuals
who I have mentioned plus a number of others are on this list.

Dear Moishe,
    I just read your e-mail & am on my way out-don't have time to elaborate
now, but IY"H I will give you the details later on the Neuman connection-it
is a definite one.  I was going to contact my mother A"H's landsman(lady)
from Hukliva today to ask her to help, because I know from when she visited
with my mother, they remembered each other's families.  Now I will wait
until you & I correspond a bit more.
    I also translitereated Neuman several ways, not knowing which is is
current use- but having Neumans on both sides of my family, I used one for
one side and one for the other.

Dear Moishe,
       Our family is descended on my mother's side from the Lisker Rav, R.
Tzvi Hersh Friedman, of Olaszliska, Hungary.  My mother's maiden name was
Goldberger, direct line from Yoizef Goldberger, son -in -law of the Lisker
(author of Ach Pri T'vua and HaYoshor V'Hatov-more on that later). I only
wish our connection to the Bnei Yissochor was as clear.  I will fill in the
missing information that I know offhand, as I don't have time to look up
trees, charts, and birth records right now.  I will fill in what I know in
CAPS, so that it will be easy for you to see what I've added.
    I also forwarded your message to another family member, and told him to
respond to you as able.

Dear Moishe,
    I made a mistake.  Herschel Newman is married to a Shusterman & living in Fla.
	Ari passed away several yrs ago. 
	I have Chana Mindel Uri's son listed as Shaya Naftali, not Naftali Shaya.If you
	don't know of any family members to consult about this, I could probably find
	someone to ask, although I am not in direct, constant contact with them.My aunt
	is.
    A key Q for you, which would hint at a lot of info:  Do you know who Naftali 
	Yeshaya (or reversed) was named after? Again, my Schonfeld Ggrandfather was
	Naftali Yeshaya Asher, and I don't know of an antecedent with that name, though
	I can go back 2 more generations.  What about the town of origin?  My Newman
	source tells me the Newmans came from Uhely.
    Also, your birthdate for NYH of 1888 seems wrong-or my dob for Ettel of 1863 is
	wrong. Let's check on that if we can.
    At this point I am still in the process of researching & entering Newman family
	names.  
                                                    Regards, Elizabeth

Hi,
Thanks for your response. You should be aware that Zvi Elimelech's (Hersh Mylech) 
namesake was the famed R' Hersh Mylech Spira, author of various books, the most 
famous entitled &quot;Bnei Yissochur&quot;, for which he is known. He lived from 
1783 - 1841. Can your datres fit with your g-grandfather being born then (>1841) 
instead of 1820-1830?

Hi,
 I wish I could help with this one but the only one that I know of is my grandfather,
 Moses (Moshe). For some reason,no one in the family knows the names of any of his 
 siblings, just that Zvi was from Hungary and born somewhere in the 1820-30 range.
 Zvi had died by 1896 since the first child to my grandparents was a boy named Hersh 
 Melech who died shortly after birth and was born in 1896. I know the names of a few 
 of his siblings children who were my grandfather's age. One of his siblings sons
 (obviously a brother) was Abe Schonfeld who accompanied my grandmother here in 1912, 
 June or so to New York  and two sisters, Esther Weisman and  Fannie Goldberg, who 
 were about my grandmother's age so born about 1875 to another of his siblings but
 dont know if they were Schoenfelds by maiden name or not.

Hi,
Can we start in the beginning? Can you list (in age order?) the children 
from each of R' Zvi Elimelech's marriages? For women, can you add their 
married names?
Do you have a genelogical report out of a program like Family Tree Maker or 
such?

The only thing that I can add is that my grandfather was the 8th of 10 children 
from the second marriage and he was born in 1867 so if R'Hersh 
Mylech Spira died in 1841, then my great grandfather would have 
been born then and fathered 10 children by the time he was 26 in 
1867, when my grandfather was born. Possible, but not likely,
unless a lot of them died in infancy and another was produced in 
less than a year. I wish I knew.

Hi all,
This is a wonderful idea of Louis's. Here is my Schoenfeld tree:
I am Marge Neff Schechner, daughter of Sylvia Schoenfeld Neff. She is the
youngest of seven children of Moses (and Rose Schreier) Schoenfeld, who was
born in Boryslav(then Austria) in 1867, the 8th of 10 children of Tzvi
Elimelech and Bella Richter Schoenfeld. Tzvi had another wife before Bella
with whom he had two children who he left with his former in laws somewhere
in Hungary. He then married Bella and had another 8 children with her. My
Tzvi antecendent died sometime around 1920. Since my grandfather, Moses,was
the 8th of 10 children, I can assume that Tzvi was born sometime around
1825-1830. Unfortunately, I don't know the names of any of my grandfather's
siblings. He had a nephew named Abraham Schoenfeld, who was born about 1890
and married a woman named Rose, and a niece named Esther who married a man
named Moishe Weisman. They had 3 children named Irving,Hannah(born about
1912) and Belle who married a man named Harold Cole(Cohen. Another niece was
Esther Zukerman (born about1890) who married a man named Max Magid.

Moishe,


I don't know where it fits. If you wish to make a Schonfeld section within
your website that would be good. I
would refer all Schonfeld correspondance to that site and encourage them to
send you postings. I would also advertise
that site to all relevant parties. I would ask you to make the Schonfeld
branch as prominent on your site as the Spira section. I sent you the Gedcom
version earlier this morning.


BEst wishes,

I had been in touch with Marge S in the past, but never received such
extensive data. There is another Hersh Meileh Schonfeld
said to have come from Stropkov. This data is from Julia Coriat and her
cousin in German (an Israeli now living there)This Hersh Meilech was born in
about 1803 and lived in the Kosice area and died in Vienna. I have more
details, but there must be
a better way than this for us to keeping repeating ourselves. There is a
Schonfeld web page, but it was started by non-Jewish Schonfelds from
Germany, even though there has been some Jewish input including my own. I
also have created a mailing list with about 20 names (I will add your name
too) for the purposes of doing a Schonfeld DNA project. Perhaps I  should
ask that we use  that mailing list to send this type of correspondance.
Attached is the latest (about 2 years old, but with a few modifications
during that time) Schonfeld chart in Gedcom 5.5

Hi,
In response to your letter:
Sylvia Schoenfeld Neff's oldest living sibling was Bertha Schoenfeld
Goldheir, born 1898. Bertha was named for her grandmother, Bella Richter
Schoenfeld, wife of Tzvi Elimelech.
There was a child born about two years before Bertha, named Harry(Hersh
Melech or Tzvi Elimelech) born about 1896 or 97 but he died at age 6
months.Bertha and Harry were born in Boryslav.


Moses Schoenfeld was born in Boryslav in 1867.
Rose Schreier Schoenfeld was born in Drohobycz in 1876.


I have no information regarding any of my grandfathers siblings. Family
story is that he was the 8th of 10 children born to Tzvi from his second
wife, Bella. The first two children were from the first wife and were left
with her parents in Hungary when he married Bella. I have the names of
several of Moses nieces and a nephew.
Abraham Schoenfeld; accompanied my grandmother to the US in 1912 and was
then 22 years old. He married a woman named Rose and they had two children.
Esther Zukerman Magid came here in October, 1912 on the Kaiser August
Victoria with my mother's five older siblings. She married a man named Max.
Esther Weisman, a niece, married to a man named Moishe. Had 3 children named
Irving, Hannah (b.1912), and Bella (b.1906) married a man named Harold Cohen
who changed the name to Cole.


I can only guess as to when Bella and Tzvi died since my grandparents named
their first two children after them. My mother told me that Tzvi's yartzeit
was on 28 Tevet and I would assume that he had died by the time Harry was
born in 1896.Bella's yartzeit is 1 Shevat. Mom's only brother, Joseph, who
died in 1990 gave her this information.


Marge


Please indulge me. Can you supply years of birth (and place) for the
following:


Sylvia Schoenfeld Neff
The name of Sylvia Schoenfeld Neff's oldest sibling, and her year of birth


Moses Schoenfeld
Rose (Schreier) Schoenfeld


Do you know the 10 children of Tzvi Elimelech and Bella Richter Schoenfeld?
Who was the oldest? born what year?

This too is in process. Are you aware of the family of Naftali Yeshaye Asher
Schonfeld from Hanusovce nad Taplou? The secular documents refer to him as
Nathan, and he is also called Naftali by contemporaries. His father was
Menachem Mendel (or some variant) who is assumed to be the brother of Moshe
Schonfeld from Medzilaborce. The family has a Tzavah from NYA which states
that they are descendants of the B.Y. Not necessariyly from Moshe ben
Eliezer but from another daughter. Elizabeth Schonfeld Feder is their family
historian. Her brothers Louis Schonfeld (Yekutiel) lives in Flatbush (less
than 5 minutes away from you) and Baruch Schonfeld also from Flatbush.  I
mentioned your name to her. Also, fee free to use my "Schonfeld subscriber"
list to disseminate any relevant information you wish. All the individuals
who I have mentioned plus a number of others are on this list.

Subject: RE: Many new Schonfeld descendants added 


Hi,
As per Louis's request, I am sending my Schoenfeld tree, what I know of it,
to the list.


I am Margery Neff Schechner. My mother is Sylvia Schoenfeld Neff, the 8th
child of Moses and Rose Schreier Schoenfeld. Her siblings are/were
Harry (Hersh Melech)Schoenfeld,born about 1896 and died in infancy.
Bertha Schoenfeld Goldheir,born-1898, died-1973.
Rae Schoenfeld Weinstein,born-1900, died-1981.
Joseph Schoenfeld, born 1902, died-1990
Matilda Schoenfeld Teitelbaum, born-1904, died-1990
Lillian Schoenfeld Spitzer, born 1906
Hannah Schoenfeld Cukell, born 1913
Sylvia Schoenfeld Neff, born 1914


My grandfather, Moses, was born in 1867 in Boryslav to Tzvi Elimelech and
Bella Richter Schoenfeld. He was the 8th of 10 children. He died in 1944 in
New York City.
My greatgrandfather, Tzvi Elimelech had a first wife who died after giving
birth to two children who were left with his dead wife's family in Hungary.
Tzvi died sometime before 1896 since my grandparents named their first
child,Harry,for him. Bella died before 1898 since my Aunt Bertha was named
for her.
Unfortunately, I do not know the names of any of my grandfather's siblings
but have several of his nieces' names and one nephew. Abe Schoenfeld, born
about 1890, married a woman named Rose and lived in New York after 1912.
Esther Zukerman arrived in New York in 1912 and married a man named Max
Magid. Esther Weisman was another niece, married to a man named Morris
(Moishe) Weisman. They had three children; Irving, Belle ,born about
1906,(who married Harold Cohen/Cole) and Hannah, born about 1912.
There is another name in the family tree, Dora Bien, wife of Henry Bien, but
I do not know how she fits in.

Dear Shmuel, Marge and Louie,

Actually, after re-reading everything at
http://www.familytreemaker.com/users/s/h/m/Rubens-Shmuel/PHOTO/0004photo.html
and
http://www.familytreemaker.com/users/s/h/m/Rubens-Shmuel/PHOTO/0005photo.html
 I can tell you based on the death entry on your site that Shmuel's "Tzvi Hersh Schonfeld" 
 was 69 when he DIED (not born) on Feb 6, 1874, which corresponds to 19 Teves, 5634. The 
 date of Feb 6 1804 is 24 Shevat, 5564. The death record on your site does not show BIRTH 
 date, only DEATH date. 

Also, this is not the same Tzvi Elimelech from Marge Schechner, who says that "My mother 
told me that Tzvi's yartzeit was on 28 Tevet and I would assume that he had died by the 
time Harry was born in 1896". Obviously the two yahrtzeits, 28 Tevet and 19 Teves do not 
match. 

Can the three of you offer any direction?

Dear Bertha


Wellcome to the club of descendants of R' Zvi Elimelech SPIRA (was LANGSAM)
from Dynov, called the Bnej Jisass'char, after his most famous book (I am
not one of his descendants, but my wife and our children are).


The best place to look for this family is the website of Moishe Miller
(descendant of a brother of R' Zvi Elimelech miDynov):  www.langsam.com


Checking the website I could not find anything about your Weinberger family.
Louis Schonfeld, also a descendant of the Dynover Rebbe) has Weinbergers in
his family tree
(http://www.familytreemaker.com/users/s/c/h/Louis-Schonfeld/tree1.html), but
they don't fit to your informations.


I would be much interested in the actual text on the gravestone. Is it in
Hebrew? How is the connection described exactly?


I found out about the connection of my family with the Dynover Rebbe by an
obituary of her grandfather, where it said: &quot;He was a grandson of the
Dynover Rebbe&quot;. After many years of complicated research I found out that he
was not a grandson, but a greatgreatgrandson! Things are even more
complicated because one of the Dynover's granddaughters (my wife's ancestor)
married the widower of her aunt (the Dynover's daughter). (see details on
Moishe Miller's website:

Dear Bertha,
Welcome indeed!
After looking through my info, the best I can find so far is the following.
R' Hersh Mylech Spira had a daughter Beila, who was first married to R' Nechemia, 
son of Tzvi. He drowned in a river during his father-in-law's lifetime. Beila 
subsequently married R' Shimon Yeshaya Reich, ABD Ludomir. She had one known 
child from each spouse. The child from Nechemia was Mechla , married Levi Yitzchok.
They had 1 known child:Michal Weinberg . See this info at
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/spira/bny-yscr.htm#L3.2


Can you provide some more background on your own ancestry. What is the lineage 
between yourself and R. Nechemia Weinberger?


Does anyone else come from the Langsam/Spira/Miller/Eckstein tree? The roots 
are primarliy Galician and northern Slovakia in the first half of the 1800's

Dear Moshe Miller:


I am still not clear about the response I got from you but we will try 
together to solve this puzzle.


My Mother was a granddaughter of R. Nechemia  Weinberger on her mother's 
side. 
I know that R. Nechemia's mother was called BABA BRUCHA .  I am named after 
her  and so is His granddaughter living in Israel.  We had in our family many 
girls named after the grandmother.  R. Nechemia Weinberger had 6 daughters 
and on son Fishel was his name.  They all moved from Poland to Cologne 
Germany in the early 1900  I think from Pzemizel (Galicia)  .


I am trying to find out from Germany when the whole family moved from Poland  
from what town or city  to Cologne Germany.


Hope this will give you some information and can help to solve our mystery.


Best regards, 

Bertha Schwarz

Hi,

Let's try it this way:
What is your mother's name, first and surname (maiden)
What were her parent's names and surnames
Your mother's grandfather was Nechemia Weinberger, born 1863. How may children 
did he have and what were their names?
Nechemia's father was R. Pessach Moshe Weinberger. His mother was Brucha. What 
was her maiden name? How many children did she have and what were their names?


This information can help us determine how you fit in the tree.

In the Encyclopedia, Me-orei Galicia, Volume 2, pages 828 and 826, it refers to 
a R' Mordecahi, of Dinov and Belz, 1870 - 1942, as a grandson of the Bnei 
Yissochur. It says that he married the daughter of R' Volf Weinberger, and
then changed his own surname to Weiberger. 

It list two sons of R' Mordche:
R' Yehoshua (1894-1966) 
R' Elazer, who died in an accident involving metal (I can not make out the 
whole story. It seems that there may have been another brother, that had a 
son Yakov, that donated a Sefer Torah in his memory).

The R' Yehoshua, son of R' Mordche has three sons:
R' Shlomo of New Jersey
R' Dov Zev of Willaimsburg, NY
R' Pesachya Meir of New Rochelle, NY

Do you know these people?

Dov Zev is Rabbi Bernard Weinberger, the rabbi of the Young Israel in

Hi,


Here is the information so far of Nechemia Weinberger;


My Mother's name was Dora Teitelbaum-Krulik
Her maiden was Dora Ksias
Her Mother's name was Leah Weinberger
Her Husband's name was Ychiel Ksias
My Great Grandfather's wife name was Sara Kelner
They had 6 daughter, and one Son
The name of the daughter were:
Leah (My Grandmother) , Beti, Miriam, Rivka, Mina, Pesia and one Son Fischel 
Weinberger.  


  My understanding is that  Nechemia's Mother ( Berucha) her  maiden name was 
Spira she married Pessach Weinberger. I do not know    how many children  she 
had beside Nechemia.  This is the information I am looking for.


I hope it makes it a bit clearer for you now.

HI,


I am not familiar with the name of Rabbi Bernard Weinberger from 
Williamsburg, Brooklyn New York.


The married names of Miriam was Weinberger and so was Mina. Miriam Weinberger 
married her cousin  Shemuel Weinberger by the same family name.  She died 
after her son's birth David.  Shemuel Weinberger married her sister Mina.  
They moved from Cologne to Bnei Berak in l936 with 3 children.  David, Moshe 
and Bracha. 
Shemuel and Mina are buried in Bnei Berak and on their graves it says that 
they are the great grandchildren of Bnei Yissochur.


Pesia Weinberger married  Israel Weisman.  After he husband died she 
remarried to  a man name Tuvia Holichitz in Israel.  She is 92 years old and 
lives in Israel.


Fischel Weinberger married Rosa Lerer they had 4 children Rivka, Miriam, 
Channa, and Yaacov. (They died in the Shoah)


Rivka Weinbeger married Yaacov Recker they did not have any children
  (They died in the Shoah)


Bety Weinberger married Hirsch Abent.  They had 4 children Clara, Norbert, 
Dora, Berte.  Clara and Norbert were twins. ( They died in the Shoah)   


My grandmother Leah Weinberger married Yechiel Ksias they had 4 children 
Dora(my mother) Moshe Adele and Menachem.  My grandparents dies in the Shoah 
.  My mother, Adele and Moshe survived and lived in Israel.  Moshe died very 
young in Israel .


I gave you a lot of information and hope that will make it a bit easier to 
connect the weinberger family
From my understanding Bracha Shapira married Pessach Weinberger .

Dynov. His wife's name was Bruchu (Bracha) .  From what I was told by my 
mother, she was the daughter of Zvi Elimelch Shapiro from dynov.  


My mother's aunt Mina was married  to Shemuel Weinberger who's bother's name 
was  Fischel Weinberger the Rabbi of Yad Eliahu in Israel.  On page 826 of 
R.Wunder's Encyclopedia   There is a picture of him.  Shemuel Weinberger he 
lived in Bnei Berack since 1936.  Mina was his second wife.  He married his 
first wife sister. who died at childbirth.  I understand that Shemuel 
weinberger and Mina (his wife) were cousins. 


I have a picture of Nechemia Weinberger tombstone.  He was buried in Bnei 
Berak and so is Shemuel and Mina Weinberger. 


I hope that this will make it clearer to you what I am looking for.


I do know that some of the family moved to Muncaz Hungary but am not clear 
yet who.

Hello,


Your am planning to do just that, to get a death certificate and immigration 
papers of Nechemia Weinberger when I will be in Israel next time.


I just looked again at the photo I took last year of the tombstone of 
Nechemia Weinberger it says the following;
R. Nechemia Weinberger the son of Pessach Moshe Weinberger the grandson of 
Bnei Yissochor from Dynov.
On Shemuel Weinberger tombstone it says; the son of R, Jacob 
 the great-grandson of Bnei Yissochor.
On the tombstone of the daughter of Nechemia Weinberger it says;
Chana Mendel Weinberger, the daughter of Nechemia and Sara the 
great-granddaughter of Bnei Yissochor.  Shemuel and Chana Mendl were husband 
and wife.  It seems to me that Nechemia Weinberger's mother was names Bracha 
and not his wife.
Nechemina Weinberger was my mother's grandfather. 
I hope that will make it clearer to find more information on the family tree.


Thanks again for your help.
Bertha Schwarz.

Subject: Weinberger Family Update

Dear All,

It has been some time since we have written and I just wanted to bring 
you up to date on where my WEINBERGER research is holding. 

I have recently uncovered some new information that seems to link us more 
closely. Bertha wrote of her great-uncle being married to a Roza Lehrer. 
This family turns out to be descendents of PESACH MOSHE and BRACHA 
Weinberger. This means that the NECHEMIA that Bertha Schwartz and Dr.
Judith Lobel come from had a sister named RIVKA. This Rivka married 
Shmuel Lehrer and had Rosa (and others). 

I have been in touch with several descendents of Rivka, living in the NY 
area and Antwerp too. They also know that Rabbi Fischel Weinberger of Yad 
Eliyahu in Israel and his brother Shmuel were cousins. Their father was 
Yakov. He may have been either a brother or nephew to Nechemia and Rivka.
This connection is only a guess right now. I am trying to contact somebody 
from that family to find out the name of Yakov's father. 

So, so far we have Brucha and Pesach Moshe with two children, Nechemia and 
Rivka. They possibly had another named Yakov. Also, please remember that 
the Bnei Yissochur (1783 - 1841) was named R' Hersh Meylech Spira. He was 
married to Chane Mindel, surname unknown. They had seven children. You can 
view this list at
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/spira/bny-yscr.htm

Now, getting back to bringing us altogether. Bertha wrote about some of the 
family going to Munkacz. Linda Cohen wrote about some Weinberg/er family that 
came to the USA from Munkacz. Maybe somebody can supply more information on 
this part.There may be some connection there. 

There is the Pesach Moshe Koifman, that I am hoping lisadan@internet-zahav.net
will tell us about.

Most importantly, Gail Furst wrote about a Hersh Meylech Weinberger who had
a daughter named Chana Mindel, born in Dubiecko. This family MUST be related, 
having the names of both the Bnei Yissochur and his wife in their family. 
Perhaps somebody can supply a contact to Moishe Gewirtz or some other family 
members from this branch. Also, Gail, can you supply an approximate time frame
for when Hersh Mylech Weinberger lived? It may be that he was yet another 
sibling to Nechemial and Rivka. 

Going back to the beginning, once again, the parents of Nechemia and Rivka 
were Pesach Moshe and Bracha. I have no proof as to which one was the 
Weinberger. In those days, it was not uncommon to only have a Jewish 
wedding ceremony, with no corresponding civil record. This would 
usually result in the children retaining the maiden name of the mother.
In our case, there are possibilities. It might be that Pesach Moshe was 
named after the father of the Bnei Yissochur, whose name was Pesach. It 
might be that Bracha was the connection. If she was, it might be that she 
was a daughter of Baila, who was the daughter of the Bnei Yissochur. There 
is no evidence that the Bnei Yissochur had more than the seven known children,
Bracha NOT being one of them. Also, given the dates involved, she would have 
been to old to have been his child. Of course, Bracha could have been almost 
any else's child too.

I hope that we can work together to try and put more of this into place. I
have recorded much of out earlier emails and they can be found at
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/spira/brknspir.htm

I will try to review the ship records available at the Ellis Island website 
for any possible new leads.

Please respond, at least to let me know your own thoughts on how to continue
from here.

Sincerely,
Moishe Miller

<strong>R' Fischel Weinberger</strong><br>
In Rabbi Meir Wunder's encyclopedia of Galician Scholars , II:824, he mentions 
a (Ephraim) Fischel Weinberg (1912 - 1964). A picture is included. He was born 
in Przemysl to Yakov, a chasid of Dynow-Belz and a descendant of the Bnei Yissochur. 
This Ephraim Fischel married Chana Teumim, daughter of R' Zev Teumim, ADMUR Zaleshchiki. 
When R' Zev passed on in 1931, the two candidates for succession were his son-in-law, 
R. Fishel Weinberger of Przemysl, and R. Mordechai Sprecher, a rabbinical judge.  
Neither was elected and both subsequently served as rabbinical judges with the 
title ABD.<p>
Fischel's wife and children perished in the Holocaust and he alone escaped to Israel 
in 1944. In 1946 he married Rivka Kliers and accepted the post of Rabbi of Yad eliyahu, 
next to Tel-Aviv. He had a brother Shmuel in Bnei Brak, who passed away 29 October 1974. 
Shmuel was married to <a href="nchmwbrg.htm#Miriam">Weinberger family</a> as well.<p>
Perhaps Fischel and Shmuel's father, Yakov, was also a son of Pesach Moshe and Bracha 
Weinberger.<p>
In the sefer Bnei Ephraim he writes of his lineage. This was published by his sons Yakov, 
Moshe of Bnei Brak, his step-daughter, Devora Shvadron and Chana Goldberg.<p>

Subject: Weinberger's from Dynow and Mukachevo

Dear Fellow Researchers,

I saw your posting in the JGFF at JewishGen. Perhaps we share a mutual interest. I am looking for 
a Weinberger family that connects to R' Hersh Mylech Spira, author of the Bnei Yissochur, and many 
other Hassidic works. 
There appears to be (at least) two Weinberger branches intertwined with the Spira family. One 
originates with Nechemya Weinberger, son of Pesach Moshe. The other is with a Naftali and Perel 
Reich, grandchildren of Beila Spira.

Dear Moishe, 

Sorry but I don't have more than my great aunt's maiden name 
Mary Weinberg/er who married my grandfather's brother Samuel Katz. 
They immigrated to NYC about 1905 from Munkacs. 

We live in Michigan.  When I was I child, there was on 'old' lady we 
called Perel (phonetically--> Perel ainy)  She may have been from 
the Hollander or Spira family.  My grandmother, (maiden name Eisenberg) 
said the woman was a cousin (I think!) --Perel could have been 
connected to Katz or Eisenberg or Weinberg--my Baba claimed 
everyone! 

Sorry I can't help more. 

Happiest Holidays to You and Yours,

Dear Moishe,
I am in the process of obtaining the Weinberger family history from a Weinberger relative 
from New Jersey. I will give you all the info that I have right now.
 
Hersh Mylech Weinberger from Dubiecko had two wives. He had a wealthy brother who lived in 
Berlin and had a street named after him. Weinbergerslass. I don't know anything else about 
his siblings or parents. Hersh had two sets of children from each wife.
There was a daughter Chana(my husband's grandmother), a son Chaim(lived in New York and had 
children Robert, Gail Lester, Susan Hiller).There were other brothers and sisters and half 
brothers and sisters.One half sister lived in Israel.
Chana Weinberger married Reuben Faust and moved to his home town of Sedziszow where they 
had 5 children. Ben(Dov Ber), Mendel, Pearl(Perel), Harry(Hersh Mylech), Morris(Moses). They 
went by the name Weinberger growing up and changed their name back to Faust after the war 
because the parents were only married by jewish law.
I noticed in the Spira family tree that David Spira had daughters that lived in Sedziszow.
 
The Weinbergers were a  large religious family with many rabbis. They lived in all the 
surrounding towns near Dubiecko.
 
There is a Moishe Gewirtz that lives in New York now . I was told that he had two wives and 
lost family in the Shoah. 
There are other Weinberger family members in the USA mainly New York,New Jersey area.I hope 
to have more info soon to make the connection with you.

I have just come across your great Research.
 
My Name is Hersh Meilech Gewurz, I am the son of Reb Moishe Gewirtz, My Father's Mothers 
name was Malka & her Father was Reb Hersh Meilech Weinberger.
 
I would be intrested to know how Reb Hersh Meilech Weinberger was connected to the

Looking forward for your respond.

I called him instead of email on
Tisha b'Av 2010
July 19, 2010

This is what Harry told me:

Moshe - born in Sanok, Sep 1 1918 - 2003 (NY)
lived in east Flatbush and married there. He was a Mashgiach for meat
In 1960 they were in Crown Heights already but moved back in 65, until 72 to East Flatbush
In 1972 they moved to Boro Park on 18th and 50th.

Moshe is the son of
Malka Weinberger (sister to Phillip - he had no children) and Dov Gewurz (died in 1920). 
Dov was a son of Moshe Gewurz, and ben-bais by Bluzower Rebbe.
Malka and Dov had Moshe and also had 2 dtrs:
* Hentcha or Esther (shot By Nazis in the very beginning of the war. She was evicted from 
  the house by the Nazis and she went back. They shot her).
* other one is unknown, she died young and caused Dov's death.

Malka passed away in Siberia
Her father was Hersh Mylech Weinberger

Moshe claimed he came from the URI mishpacha.
Also that Malka and Dov were first cousines, but the 
connection to the Bnei Yissoschur was only based on Malka 

After Siberia Moshe lived is Estreich. 
He married a Wasserstein who died during childbirth, with the child.
She has a sister, married to Binyomin (Yumtchi) Goldstein.

Moshe's second wife is Perel Ganzfried, and they have Hersh Mylech (Harry). 
Harry lives at 777 Kent Ave, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NY

Pesha Horowitz/Stockholmer (1894 - 1979) was married to Avrohm Zusha <strong>Ziskind</strong>. 
According to her family, she was a descendent of the Bnei Yissochur. 
In an attempt to determine the connection, the following is presented. <p>
Pesha and Avrohm Zusha had three children; Sholom Ber, Leah, and Yechiel.
Pesha's parents were Dovid <strong>Horowitz</strong> of Estila, Galicia and Leah 
<strong>Halcer</strong> (c. 1878 - 1946).<br>
Pesha's two siblings were Mindel and Zissel<p>
Dovid's parents were Yechiel and Pesha Horowitz. This Horowitz family was of direct paternal 
descent from the <strong>ShL&quot;Ah</strong>.
Leah's father was R' Zev Halcer. Leah may have had a brother Mayer.<p>
The family beleives that the connection may be within the branch of <a href="bny-yscr.htm#L3.3">R' David Spira</a>,

&#149; <strong>Chana Mindel Stern nee Langsam</strong><br>
The Stern family, descended from Chana Mindel Langsam, married to Chaim Stern, claims 
to be from the Bnei Yissochur. It would seem that Chana Mindel's father, <a href="../langsam/chaimleb.htm">Chaim Leib Langsam</a> 
was married to a female descendent. At least three of his grandchildren were named Tzvi 
Elimelech.<p>
My own theory is that he was not the son of Pesach Langsam, but the grandson (or further). 
This would make it more plausible for him to be on the same generation as the Bnei Yissochur's 
grandchildren.<p>
Further indication of this is the birth of his oldest child occuring in 1830, making him 
about 53 at the time. It would be far more convincing to make his birthdate two decades 
or more later.<p>
In any event, his actual connection to the Bnei Yissochur is still unknown.

Hi,

Rabbi Moshe Tovia Weissberger of Kiryat Sanz, Israel contacted me regarding
his wife's descent from the Bnei Yissochur, R' Hersh Mylech Spira (1783 -
1841). He did not know the exact connection but was hoping to learn it. I
was unable to help but thought maybe someone from our group could further
identify or add genealogical material. He related the following:

His wife, Rivka SIMON, is the daughter of Pinchus Shlomo SIMON and Perel
EHRENFELD (1912 - 1994). This Perel was the daughter of Tzvi EHRENFELD and
Kreindel HAPLERIN (or HALPERT) of Mako, Hungary. Rabbi Weissberger believes
that the connection is probably via this Kreindel, whose parents were Yona
Zev Ha'Levi, the shochet in Mako, and Esther BERENSTEIN (daughter of Yakov
Yitzchok Ha'cohen and Margolit Rivka, also of Mako, Hungary). Yona Zev was
originally from Mukachevo before going to Mako. His parents were Akiva and
Esther.

Incidentally, the Pinchs Shlomo SIMON mentioned above was the son of Moshe
and Leah DEUTSCH, also of Mako, Hungary. 

If anybody can shed more light on this family or there connection to R'
Hersh Mylech SPIRA, please contact me.

Thanks!

<pre>
The Blazowa Chevra Kadisha Society lists a Pesach ben Tzvi Elimelech Weinberger
that passed away 8 Shevat 5732 (January 24, 1972). This is obviously connected 
to the family. The Bnei Yissoschur was Tzvi Elimelech and his father was Pesach. 
Also, there are quite a few Weinberger families that connect to the family. Some
of thier roots are known and some are not, although they have tradition that they
do descend from the Bnei Yissoschur.

Cross-referencing the surname and death date with the Social Security death index
produces one result:

Hi,

Thanks for your reply. If you look at one of my webpages,
at
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/spira/bny-yscr.htm
you can see that the Bnei Yissoschur had a daughter Sara
that married Moshe Schonfeld. His known children were:
R' Pesach Avrohm , Lazar , Pessil , Yitta Leah , Mordechai
Yosef , Rivka , Shimon , Asher , Bracha , Mirel Lifsha , R'
Zvi Elimelech

Can you ask him which one you come from? Also, I may be
able to connect you anyhow, if you just tell me the names
of your father's parents.

Chag Sameyach!
Moishe

Hope you had a good Yom Tov.

My father's name is Aharon David.  His father was Shlomo and his 
mother was Shari/Shaindel/Sara Ashkenasy.  The father of Shlomo was 
also Aharon David and his wife's name was Leah.  My father thinks 
that the father of Aharon David may have been Chaim Yankel, but 
he's not sure.  He will check with his cousin whose name is Chaim 
Yankel (Weisz - in Toronto) to see if he knows.  When I showed my 
father your email, he said that the name Zvi Elimelech rang a bell, 
but he's not sure.  My grandfather, Shlomo, had an older brother 
named Avraham, so I thought perhaps that came from Pesach Avrohm.  
My father's uncle Avrohom Schoenfeld was a Rav in Aiud (Rumanian 
pronunciation) or Enyet (Hungarian pronunciation).  Avrohom and 
Shlomo had two sisters, Rivka (Weisz) and Sara (Ganz).I'll let you 
know when I get more information.  Please let me know if anything I 
just told you fits what you know.

Dear Hagai, 

I am an amateur genealogist and have been working with
Carol to try and determine if we are indeed related via the
Bnei Yissoschur (R' Hersh Mylech Spira, 1783 - 1841). Carol
has outlined the ancestry, back to her great-grandparents,
Aharon and Leah Schonfeld. Their children were Shlomo,
Avraham, Rivka (Weisz) and Sara (Ganz).

Can you supply dates of birth/death for Aharon or his wife
Leah? Do you know where they lived? Do you know their
parents or siblings, or can you establish the exact
connection your family has to the Bnei Yissoschur?

I have a website on my family history and the SPIRA part
can be found at:
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/spira/spira.htm

I think that your branch probably comes from Sara SPIRA,
married to Moshe SCHONFELD.

Dear Mr. Langsam

Thank you for your note. Somehow the name Langsam strikes a familiar
cord. I remember that in my youth this name was mentioned.

The Rimalt family is my mothers family. The Dobromil branch I met in
1934 or 1932 when I visited Rabbi Teitelbaum in Dobromil. My grandfather
Rabbi Zvi Hirsh Rimalt sent me from Chyrov to visit him.

After the war I had some contact with his daughter who survived the
holocaust and wa able to save some of the manuscript on the Shulchan
Aruch either from her father or grandfather.

I enclose in Hebrew - if you can read it the genealogy of the Rimalt
family. It is not complete and some things are still cropping up
We visited Chyrov, Dobromil and Zolkiew a few years ago. There is
nothing left from what I remember

Shana Tova

Hi,

By the way, have you reviewed JewishGen's Poland database?
There are index records for names that look like you would
be interested in.

Also, my connection to all this is via the Bnei Yissoschur
(my g-g-g-uncle). I am a direct descendent of Pesach
Langsam. 

The Bnei Yissoschur's known children can be seen in my
website at:
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/spira/spira.htm

You (and Rabbi Wunder in Meorei Galicia) claim that R'
Rimalt was a son-in-law of the Bnei Yissoschur. I find this
unlikely as there were only seven known children, all
accounted for. More likely is that he was a
"grandson"-in-law, married to one of the Uri children,
maybe as a second marriage. R' Yakov Uri was a son-in-law
of the Bnei Yissoschur and was ABD of Turka.

What are your thoughts?

Moishe

Briefly these are the answers.

The reference to the connection of Rimalt of Dobromil is in the attached
document which seems to be reasonably reliable. May be you could follow this
up

I have not been in contact with the Teitelbaum family. Rebbezin Halberstam
probably does not live anymore. Her relative I think her son-in law used to
live in Boropark and the last address I had was 829 47th Street and
telephone number 718 8530359. She survived the war and has many stories
about my grandfather and about Dobromil.

You probably know more about the Bnei Yissaschar than I. As you see from the
date he died about 173 years ago

I do not have the website of the Jewish Ge'n Poland database . Can you give
it to me

Shalom,
I don't have too many thoughts on RYMALD...nor much information either. I have 
a family photo which includes my Avrum Rymald, his wife, mother-in-law &amp; children. 
According to my late mother, Avrum made taleisim for a living, loved to travel (&amp; was 
said to have even visited Eretz Yisroel), & did next to nothing to support his family. 
His mother-in-law Beila was my grandmother's stepmother - she lived with her daughter in 
Bobov, & my grandfather sent them money from the US until Beila died just before the war. 
To the best of my knowledge the whole family was killed in the holocaust. The only 
documentation I have for that is records from Belgium that tell of Avrum's son Hershel 
(who worked as a diamond-cutter) being sent for forced labor & eventually being deported 
to Auschwitz. The records show that his wife (a cousin) & 5-yr old dgtr were deported on 
a different date. A cousin here in Israel once told me that there was a related Rymald 
family here. 1 of this family was a cabinet minister many years ago - I think his name 
was Elimelech. So maybe all these people are cousins, but (as my elderly aunt used to 
say) you can't prove it by me...Is Dobromil anywhere near the Bobov-Gorlice-Tarnov 
area?

Best wishes for a Shana Tova,
Chana Saadia

Hi,
I saw your JewishGen posting and am wondering if we might have a connection. Does your family 
have the names Pesach, Chana Mindel or Tzvi Elimelech (Hersh Mylech) in it? We had Weinberger 
cousin's that descended from the Bnei Yissoschur of Dynow (1783 - 1841).

I have a website at www.langsam.com that details some of the families that connect. Some of my 
Weinberger pages in the site are at

Just Tzvi Elimelech.

To my knowledge, the lineage is as follows:
David Rand (Munkacs 1917- Brooklyn 2000)
son of Yaakov Tzvi Rand (born in Turka 18??- died in Munkas ~192?)
grandson of Tzvi Elimelekh ("Hersh-Maylekh") Diller
grandson of Tzvi Elimelekh Spiera of Dynow (1783-1841) (author of 
B'nai Yissoschor)

Our Weinberger connection is through Yaakov Tzvi Rand's wife and 
David Rand's mother: Feige Elka Rand (b.?-killed 1944 Auschwitz) 
who was born a Weinberger. Other people in her family included her 
nephews - Usher Yoineh (the Temishvarer Rebbe) and Alter (The 
Turker Rav). Other people in her family were named Nooteh, Shimon 
and Berish.

Hi,

The info I have is slightly different than what you present
(see attached .pdf file). Yakov Tzvi Rand' father was
Shmuel Zanvil Rand. I have this info from the Encyclopedia
Meorei Galicia, 5:393 (by R. Meir Wunder of Jerusalem).
This Shmuel Zanvil Rand was married to the daughter (name

You can see some of this at my website, via www.langsam.com

Regarding DILLER, they married into the greater LANGSAM

Regarding WEINBERGER, there are several connections to the
SPIRA clan, although some can not trace all the way back.

What is your exact connection to all this? Can you shed

This makes sense except that my father was an excellent yichus historian 
and he told me that his father's grandfather was a Diller. We have pictures 
of Yakov tzvi and of Hersh-Maylekh Diller ( who you would say is Schonfeld?) 
that would fit in style with a late 1800's date. I am very surprised - if 
you're right then the  date of tzvi elimelech shoenfeld's date  would be 
later than his grandson Yaakov Tzvi! - Iwould have thought my dad would 
mention this.

My father had an older brother named shmuel zanvel who was probably named 
after his father.

My connection - I am the oldest of David rand's 5 children, born 1948.

But I will cc my sister and brothers in case they have better info.
Our only first cousin on the Rand side - Elizabeth (Faigy) Rand Grauman - 
of Silver Spring might also have some info.
Let me know what you determine,

Hi, Yankel.
 
SOme of the facts that I got over time (not always consistent):
 
Tvi Hersh Elimelech of Dinov was the B'nai Yisooschor. - he goes back to 
the 1700's, and should be dated as a younger contemporary of the Bal Shem, 
or as a student of a disciple of the Bal Shem.
 
Diller married either a daughter or granddaughter of the Dinuver Rebbe, the 
Bnai Yisoschor. I never heard that last name. I am pretty sure that the 
lineage transferred to the Rand's rather than through the Weinberger.
 
Tati's father was 1884-1924.
 
I am pretty sure that Tati said that his mother and father were shiduched 
in a village in the Carpathians, when his father was about 20 years old, 
when one of the families came up from the Munkaczer side of the mountains, 
and the other from the Galizianer side. I forget which was which. And that 
the rand family moved into Munkacz around the start of World War I.
 
In 1920 Yaakov Tzvi Rand was arrested in Munkacz and held for about two weeks, 
because of some WW I evasion of draft service. He was according to tati turned 
in by a Jewish informer, and eventually freed by a judge, thanks to help from 
a SPielman girl. This should be in the Munkaczer court house records. According 
to tati the courthouse was at the end of Louis Kossuth street, where he had 
lived. (I have not yet been there and don't know if the geography is accurate.

Yes - you've hit on something
 
Jacob and Nettie Rand brought our family to NYC  from Germany in 1949.
Sinai, one of their younger sons was remembered by my mother, Eva (Stamler) 
Rand - he would have been 2 years younger than her - and became a Professor 
of Emgineering in the Bay area (I believe Berkley).
Yetta (Rand) Schindelheim was Jacob's sister and lived in Boro Park. I 
remeber her visiting us on occasional Shabatot.
My father David Rand (born 1917-died 2000) would ask me to give regards to 
"our cousin" the bluzhever Rabbi on the winter days in Williamsburgh when 
our class met in his shul because the Yehiva hadn't paid the bill for heating  
oil (I presume this is identical to " +Tzvi Elimelech Spira    1904 - 1975").
Milstein was a name we heard frequently - especially a "Velvel Milstein"
I'm intrigued by how we fit into the larger landscape of the descendants of 
Bnai Yissoschor but am  am especially drawn to memorializing our first cousins, 
the children of my farther's siblings Velvel, Yeedel, Yossel, Zeesy, Gella and 
Shmuel Zanvil - all of who perished. We guess there must have been about 15-20 
of them, but neither my father nor uncle ever referred to them by name or 
number. Is there any way for us to gather these souls for memorialization?
Jacob

Hi,

The Bluzhever Rebber was a different Tzvi Elimelech Spira.
The prior Rebbe was R' Yisroel Spira - 1891 - 1989. His
adopted son is R' Tzvi Elimelech Spira, born 1936, lives in
Boro Park (NY) today.

Going back to your family, I too would like to have a
memory of the clan. Since you are anyhow already connected
to me via Pesach Langsam (see below for my "wrong" lineage
of your clan), let us first begin by outlining the names of
your father and his siblings, with the names of their
spouses.

Also, do you have any Israel relatives that can try to
locate this Sara Scharf in Holon?

Subject: DILLER from Dynow

Hi,

I saw your JewishGen posting and was wondering if you could
tell me a little bit more about your DILLER interest. I am
interested in a Chana Mindel Millstein nee DILLER, born
1870 in Dynow. I think her husband was Anshil. A
granddaughter by the name of Sara Scharf was living in
Holon, Israel in 1986.

She was related to R' Hersh Mylech Spira, the Bnei
Yissoschur and Pesach LANGSAM.

Thanks!

Hi Moishe,

The "tree" goes like this:

Moses DILLER b: Przeworsk, Austria (now Poland)
+Esther 

...Abraham DILLER b: 10 Dec 1869 Przeworsk d: 11 Oct 1942 Theresienstadt 
...+Mirl REIFER b: 08 Aug 1866 Sieniawa, Austria (now Poland) 

......Pinkas DILLER b: 07 Dec 1892 Sieniawa d: 16 Apr 1942 Sachsenhausen 
......+Breindel? b: Abt. 1905

......Samuel DILLER b: 04 Jan 1896 Sieniawa d: 07 Jan 1943 Auschwitz 
......+Feige

......Josef DILLER b: 1898 Sieniawa

......Joachim (Chaim) DILLER b: 10 Feb 1904 Sieniawa 
......d: Aft. 24 Aug 1942 probably at Auschwitz
......+Rosa REIFER b: 04 Jul 1902 Lezajsk 
......d: Aft. 24 Aug 1942 probably at Auschwitz

.........Herman DILLER b: 09 Dec 1936 Berlin, Germany
.........d: Aft. 24 Aug 1942 probably at Auschwitz

Mirl REIFER was the sister of my mother's paternal grandfather, Zvi Hersh
REIFER. Rosa REIFER was Hersh's daughter.

The sources of my information were Arolsen records at Yad Vashem, Yad Vashem
pages of testimony, and Jewish registration records from Nazi-occupied
Belgium.

No Dynow connection that I know of, but I know little about this family.

Good luck.

Renee

So sorry about Diller. It was my father's name from Linsk, Lucawicza, Galicia. 
I am looking too, but right now I am writing and the two are not compatible!!!

hello - none of these names are familiar - the Diller family of which i am 
a descendant lived in Dynow, Sanok, and Brzozow (all of which I understand 
are short distances from each other and due west of Lemberg/Lvov)...... My 
grandfather's name was David Diller and he and his wife and children (Jack, 
Joe [my father], Louie and Freda) emigrated to America (San Francisco) 
between 1913 and 1921. They joined many other Diller cousins who had 
arrived in San Francisco at the turn of the century with their father Beryl 
Diller (David's brother). Unfortunately, I do not know any of the names of 
David and Beryl's aunts or uncles, nor their first cousins, so this is the 
best I can do.
 
Where are you located? It is always nice to communicate with a landzman.

Sorry I do not have any knowledge of the people you mention.  My grandmother, 
Esther, was a Diller.  She had two sisters, Breindal and Perel, and at least 
one brother, Yechiel Aaron, who was Shamus to the Bluzhver Rebbi.

Hi,

The Bluzhever Rebber was a g-g-grandson of the Bnei
Yissoschur, so perhaps we still have a connection. Do you
