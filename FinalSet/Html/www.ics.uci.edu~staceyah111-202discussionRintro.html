    <h1>R Programming Environment</h1>
    R is a high-level object-oriented programming language, which is a
    free version of the programming language S (click <a
      href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/html/interface98-paper/paper.html"><span
        style="text-decoration: underline;">here</span></a> for a
    history of R). By object-oriented, we mean that everything in R is
    treated as an "object". A data frame is a specific type of object in
    R; so is a numeric value, or a character value, or a matrix. <br>
    <br>
    <h3>How to Start R</h3>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span>
    <p>Once R is installed on your computer, it opens as any other
      application. In Windows, go to the start menu, then to the R
      folder and click on the R icon. On a Mac, open the Applications
      folder and click on the R icon. It is also useful to create a
      desktop shortcut to the program. On a Unix/Linux machine, just
      type R in the terminal and hit enter.<br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <h3>The R Console<br>
    </h3>
    <p>When you open R, you will see the "R Console" window and &gt;,
      R's <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">command






        prompt</span>. This indicates R is ready to evaluate a command.
      For example,<br>
    </p>
    <pre>&gt; sample(1:6,1)<br>[1] 5<br>&gt;<br></pre>
    The command <span style="font-family: monospace;">sample(1:6,1)</span>
    tells R to take a sample of size 1 from the numbers 1 through 6. R
    responds with <span style="font-family: monospace;">[1] 5</span>.
    The [1] says how many calculations R has done (you can ignore it).
    Then it gives another &gt;, showing that it's ready for another
    command.<br>
    <br>
    R also has a <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0,
      0);">continuation prompt</span>, +, which occurs if your command
    did not properly end. <br>
    <pre>&gt; sample(1:6,<br>+ 1)<br>[1] 5<br></pre>
    R will not return to the command prompt &gt; until you finish the
    command that started the continuation prompt.<br>
    <br>
    <h3>R Syntax</h3>
    R has many built-in functions. When we use an R <span style="color:
      rgb(153, 51, 0); font-weight: bold;">function</span>, the syntax
    is as follows:<br>
    <br style="font-weight: bold;">
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"> function.name(arg.name=value,...)</span><br>
    <br>
    For example, the "rep" function creates a vector of repeated values:<br>
    <pre>rep(x=3, times=10)<br></pre>
    The function has two arguments named "x" and "times". We want to
    repeat the value 3 ten times. If we keep the arguments in the same
    order, we do not need to type their names:<br>
    <pre>rep(3,10)<br></pre>
    But if we don't use the argument names, order matters:<br>
    <pre>rep(10,3)<br></pre>
    The "#" sign is the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153,
      0, 0);">comment character</span>. Everything after a # is ignored
    by R:<br>
    <pre>3+5 # R ignores everything I say from now on...<br></pre>
    <br>
    <h3>Working Directory</h3>
    Any objects we export from R will be saved in its working directory.
    We can use the commands <span style="font-family: monospace;">setwd()</span>
    or <span style="font-family: monospace;">getwd()</span> to set the
    working directory or to ask R what working directory it is using.
    Alternatively, we can go to the drop down menus Misc&gt;Change
    Working Directory or Misc&gt;Get Working Directory (Mac OSX) or
    File&gt;Change dir... (PC).<br>
    <br>
    <h3>Organizing R Code<br>
    </h3>
    <p>It is a good idea to write your R commands in a separate window
      before evaluating the commands in the R console. This will become
      crucial as you start using for loops and writing functions. From
      within R we can open a "script" file by going to File&gt;New
      Document. This just opens a text editor where we can store code.
      When you save a script file, you should use the extension .R.
      Later, if you would like to run the code, you can copy and paste
      into R (or on Windows, the script window has the option to
      evaluate), or involving even less work, you can source the file
      into R without opening it. For example, if your code is saved as
      mycode.R, then from within R, we can go to "File&gt;Source File"
      and choose that file. Or, we could type<br>
    </p>
    <pre>source("mycode.R")<br></pre>
    <p><u>if the file is in your working directory</u>. If the file is
      located elsewhere on the computer, you need to enter the entire
      file extension. We can even source in code off the web!<br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <h3>How to Save and Quit R<br>
    </h3>
    There are three types of files you might want to save from your R
    session:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>From within a script window, File&gt;Save will save a .R file
        containing your R commands.</li>
      <li>From within the R console, File&gt;Save will save a .txt file
        containing what you see in the console.</li>
      <li>From within the R console, Workspace&gt;Save Workspace File
        will save a .RData file of the R objects you created. If you
        double click the .RData file, it will open the R session with
        all of your objects still saved.</li>
    </ol>
    You can quit R by typing the quit command:<br>
    <pre>q()<br></pre>
    or by the drop down menu R&gt;Quit R. When you quit, R will ask you
    if you would like to save the workspace image. This is not the same
    as saving what you see in the console! Instead, it saves all the
    objects you have created as a .RData file. However, it will not ask
    you where to save it or what to name it. If you would like to save
    the workspace, go to Workspace&gt;Save Workspace File before
    quitting.<br>
