<h2>CS 163, Spring 2012, Homework 4, due Thursday, May 3</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Draw an undirected graph with eight vertices, for which Bor&#367;vka's algorithm uses three rounds to find the minimum spanning tree. Is this possible for graphs with seven vertices? Why or why not?</p></li>

<li><p>Suppose that a three-way election is held between three candidates named Sarkozy, Merkel, and Putin. Among the voters,
<blockquote>45% prefer Sarkozy first, Merkel second, and Putin last,<br/>
35% prefer Putin first, Merkel second, and Sarkozy last, and<br/>
20% prefer Merkel first, Putin second, and Sarkozy last.</blockquote>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Who would win in an election using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borda_count">Borda count</a>?</p></li>
<li><p>Who would win in an election using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting">instant runoff</a>?</p></li>
<li><p>Who would win in an election using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method">Schulze widest-path system</a>?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method">Condorcet winner</a>? If so, who is it? If not, why not?</p></li></ol></li>

<li><p>List the edges of the minimum spanning tree for the graph shown below, in the order that Kruskal's algorithm would add them to the tree.</p>

<li><p>What is the running time for each of the three algorithms,
Prim-Dijkstra-Jarnik, Bor&#367;vka, and Kruskal, when used to build a maze
from a <i>k</i>-by-<i>k</i> grid of squares? For Prim-Dijkstra-Jarnik, use the
analysis for the variant of the algorithm that uses binary heaps, and
for Kruskal's algorithm, assume that the sorting stage of the algorithm
is done using a comparison sorting algorithm.  Express your answers in
O-notation, as a function of&nbsp;<i>k</i>.</p></li>
