<h2><A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics54/">ICS 54 Winter 2000</A>:
Homework 3
</h2>

<p>
<dl>
<dt>This assignment is to be done individually.
<dt>All work for it should be done in a special directory (on a UCI
UNIX system, either ICS or OAC-EA) which you
set aside for the purpose which contains no other work and
which you keep for future reference and use in this course.
<dd>Suggestion: Have a <tt>ics54</tt> directory and
put the work for this assignment in an <tt>ics54/hw3</tt>
subdirectory.
<dt>This assignment is due at <b>the start of class, Wednesday, February 9</b>.
<dd>You will turn in a printout with a separate cover/title page
containing:
<br> (1) Your Personal Identification (Name, Student ID number, and UCInetID),
<br> (2) Assignment Identification (course name and quarter
plus assignment number).  
<dt>Please print separate parts of the
assignment on separate sheets and label the pages appropriately.
</dl>
<p>

<p>
The TA or Instructor will be available in CS 364 at the following times:
<ul>
<li>Wednesday, February 2: 4:30-5:30 p.m.
<li>Thursday & Friday, February 3 & 4: 10 a.m. - noon
</ul>
The Instructor will also be available in his office (Engineering Gateway
2149) Monday, February 7: 4:30-5:30 p.m.

<ol>
<li>Create a (Bourne) shell script <tt>SpellCheck</tt> so that
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<tt>SpellCheck Where SFX Age Results</tt>
<br>will search the directory <tt>Where</tt> and all directories
under it for files whose names end in the suffix <tt>SFX</tt>
and which have been modified in the last <tt>Age</tt> days.
For each such file it finds, the name of that file, preceded
by "<tt>===</tt>" should be added to the file <tt>Results</tt>
and then all misspellings in the file found should be added
to <tt>Results</tt>.  Anything that was in <tt>Results</tt>
before <tt>SpellCheck</tt> is run will be destroyed.
<p>
<i>Hints:</i>&nbsp; Use the <tt>find</tt> command to find the files.
Use a separate shell script to process each file found.
Separately check the <tt>find</tt> portion of your solution
and this other shell script.  There are a number of ways that
one can make <tt>Results</tt> an empty file before you start to
add things to it.  So that you will have files that are at least
a few days old, create some sample data files <i>before</i>
you do anything else with this assignment other than read it.

<p>For this part, you should submit a well commented
listing (WCL) of <tt>SpellCheck</tt>
and at least 3 sample runs showing how (well) it works.
Include also (of course) an explanation of the sample runs, stating
how they show that your <tt>SpellCheck</tt> works well.

<p>&nbsp;

<li>Create a (Bourne) shell script <tt>NewName</tt> such that
"<tt>NewName&nbsp;sname</tt>" will create a name/string of the
form "<tt>sname.garbage</tt>" where <tt>garbage</tt> is
some collection of characters that is almost sure to be
different each time you invoke the <tt>NewName</tt> command.
(<i>Hint:</i>&nbsp; 
"<tt>$$</tt>" will give you a number that changes from one
process to the next (why?) and the <tt>date</tt> command
produces values that change over time (of course, &nbsp<tt><i>:-)</i></tt>
&nbsp;).

<p>For this part, submit the same type of WCL and sample
runs with explanations as you did for the previous part.

<p>&nbsp;

<li>Create a C shell alias <tt>NewNameC</tt> which does
the same thing as <tt>NewName</tt> without (of course!)
using <tt>NewName</tt>.
<p>For this part, submit the same type of listings as
with the previous parts.

<p>&nbsp;

<li>Create a (Bourne) shell script <tt>MyFriends</tt>
which considers its arguments to be a list of friends'
user names and lists all the processes these friends
are running (sorted by user names).
(<i>Hint:</i>&nbsp; With appropriate options and arguments,
the following comands might be
of use:&nbsp;<tt>?grep&nbsp;tr&nbsp;ps</tt>)

<p>For this part, submit the same type of listings as
with the previous parts.

<p>&nbsp;

<li>For each of the following commands create a set of
examples (the number expected is given in parentheses
after each command) illustrating the command's distinct capabilities:
<tt>grep</tt>(3), 
<tt>fgrep</tt>(2), 
<tt>egrep</tt>(3),
<tt>sort</tt>(3),
<tt>tr</tt>(2),
<tt>uniq</tt>(3).
<p>You are both allowed and encouraged to produce examples
which illustrate more than one of these at a time and which
use other commands as well. Thus, the example shown in class
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<tt>tr -cs '[A-Z][a-z]' '[\012*]' < F | sort |\
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
uniq -c |sort +nr | head -10'</tt>
<br>would be, with suitable explanation and a sample run,
a fine example of the use of "<tt>tr</tt>," "<tt>sort</tt>,"
and "<tt>uniq</tt>" (with "<tt>head</tt>" thrown in for good measure)
had it not been preempted by its use in class.  (So it goes.)
<p>
On the other hand, since this is an individual assignment and there
are literally millions of possible examples, it would be both
most surprising and most unfortunate if two people submitted
examples that were essentially the same.
