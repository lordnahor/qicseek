    <h1>Homework guidelines</h1>
    

    <h3>Due dates/late policy</h3>
    Homeworks will only be accepted electronically through the EEE dropbox. The dropbox will have a automatic deadline of 11:59 pm on the given due date. <i> No homeworks will be accepted after that time</i>. I know this is a tough requirement, but in return, I'll award extra credit for early-submitted homeworks as described below. If you are working down to the last minute, <b> please </b> make sure something is uploaded 10 minutes prior to the deadline to ensure you won't get zero credit.


    <h3>Grading</h3>
    
    Each assignment has both programming and written components.  Your
    code will be graded both on clarity and correctness.  
    It is generally more important that your code be clear and
    correct than fast.  Your writeup should 
    be richly illustrated with graphs and images, and your code
    should be well commented and documented.

    <h3>Extra-credit</h3>      
      Any homework that is handed in one day early (11:59 pm on the previous day) will get 10% extra-credit. For a 50-point assignemnt, this is 5 extra points.      
    

    <h3>Homework Submission Instructions</h3>
    
    <p> Submit a zip or tar archive containing your
      code and your HTML writeup into the appropriate directory in the <tt>EEE Dropbox</tt>.  Use the following directory structure:
      
    <blockquote><tt><pre>
YourName/code
YourName/html
      </pre></tt></blockquote>
    
    <p>
      The <tt>code</tt> subdirectory should contain all of your code.  Include
      everything that your code needs to run.  If I hand out code as part of the
      assignment, include that also.
      The <tt>html</tt> subdirectory should contain your writeup, including 
      images and figures.  I (and you) should be able to point 
      a web browswer at that directory to view your writeup.  
      
      
    <p>
      Zip or tar the <tt>YourName</tt> 
      directory and submit either <tt>YourName.zip</tt> or 
      <tt>YourName.tar.gz</tt> or <tt>YourName.tgz</tt> or a URL
      to the file to the instructor via email.  You can create an archive
      of the <tt>YourName</tt> directory in various ways:
      
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li> Right-click on the folder and select "Create archive".
	Select either "zip" or "tar.gz" to create the archive, or
      <li> In a terminal, cd to the directory
	containing <tt>YourName</tt> and type <tt>zip -r YourName
	  YourName</tt> to create <tt>YourName.zip</tt>, or
      <li> In the terminal, type <tt>tar cfz YourName.tgz YourName</tt>
	
	to create <tt>YourName.tgz</tt>.
    </ul>
    
    <p>You can list the contents of a zip archive with the command
      <tt>unzip -l YourName</tt> and the contents of a tar archive with
      the command <tt>tar tfz YourName.tgz</tt>.
      
    <h3>Homework Writeup Guidelines</h3>
    
    <p>
      You must submit your writeups as as a single HTML web page.  HTML
      makes it easy to include
      links to high resolution images as well as video in your writeups.
      <em>I will not accept writeups in any word processing format
	such as MS Word or Open Office.</em>  
      
      
    <p>If you don't know how to create an HTML document look at
      this <a href="htmlTutorial.shtml">quick tutorial</a> that includes a
      <a href="template">writeup template</a>.
      
    <p><em>Any figure or image in your writeup should be small enough to
	fit on both the screen and the printed page.</em>  The web page
      should therefore be not wider than 650 pixels.  I will print out
      your assignments for grading purposes on a nice color laser printer,
      so this is important.  Large images and figures do not belong in the
      main text of your writeup.  If you need to show image details in a
      figure, then zoom into the image.  You may provide links to high
      resolution images in the HTML, but huge images should 
      not appear on the main writeup page.
      
    <p>Some guidelines for your figures:
      
    <ul>
      
	<p><li><b>Use a proper size and aspect ratio.</b>  If you are showing
	an image, make sure that the pixels are displayed square.  Use
	the <tt>axis image</tt> command.  If the image is not too large,
	ensure that image and screen pixels coincide with the
	
	<tt>truesize</tt> command.
	
	<p><li><b>Always show the colorbar for 2D data.</b>  Whether your are
	showing an image or data in the form of an image, always show the
	colorbar.  If you are showing an image, this will verify that the
	color map spans the correct range (usually <tt>[0,1]</tt>).  If
	you are showing data, then this will show the meaning of the colors.
	The only exception is when you show RGB images; in that case, the
	colorbar is meaningless because the colormap is not used.
	
	<p><li><b>Use a sensible color map.</b>  There are 3 standard color
	maps available to you: <tt>gray</tt>, <tt>jet</tt>,
	and <tt>hsv</tt>.  In the few cases where your data is periodic
	(such as with angles), then use <tt>colormap hsv</tt>.  Otherwise,
	use <tt>gray</tt> or <tt>jet</tt>.  Which is appropriate
	depends on what you are trying to show.  Use the colormap that most
	effectively communicates your point.
	
	
	<p><li><b>Use a proper display range.</b>  If you are showing a
	grayscale image, make sure that MATLAB does not remap the colors.
	The <tt>imagesc</tt> command has an optional parameter for this
	purpose, e.g. <tt>imagesc(im,[0,1])</tt> will make sure the color
	map spans the range <tt>[0,1]</tt>.  If you are showing data, then
	allowing <tt>imagesc</tt> to scale the color map to the range of
	the data is usually appropriate.  If your data is mostly symmetric
	around zero, then consider using a display range that is symmetric
	around zero,
	e.g. <nobr><tt>imagesc(im,[-1,1]*max(abs(im(:))))</tt></nobr>
	
	<p><li><b>Consider screen capture for figures.</b>  There are
	three ways to create images of your figures:  
	<p>
	<ul>
	  <li> Use a screen capture utility.  
	  <li> Select File > Save As... from the figure window, and export as
	    an image (PNG, TIFF, JPG, etc.).
	  <li> Use the <tt>print</tt> command.
	</ul>
	
	<p><li><b>Use imwrite() for saving images.</b>  To directly export
	an image from Matlab, use the <tt>imwrite</tt> command.  
	
	
    </ul>
