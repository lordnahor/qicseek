		<description><![CDATA[Interesting fact that the entrance exam weeds out the cream of the crop but once they&#039;re in the quality of instruction is at par w/other universities and colleges. I wonder if the students feel &quot;cheated&quot; - after all the hard work in spite of their exceptional talents and not being challenged to their potential?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The dilution issue is not related to increasing seats at the current institutes, but sopening others when we don&#039;t have adequate (teaching) resources at the current institutes.
IITs can not compete, in the current structure, because they must reward faculty based on standard Governmental policies.  Foreign universities will not have that limitation.

Our focus has to be on building quality at the current IITs to match -- in fact reduce the gap -- the quality of students.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1. NOT increasing IIT&#039;s is not the solution of the problem of lack of infrastructure and prof&#039;s.

2. Dilution is not true. The number of seats at IIT&#039;s have hardly kept pace with the population increase in last 30 years, and IIT&#039;s was still a good brand in 70&#039;s. If selection criteria of 0.1% is good, I believe 0.2% is equally good.

3. If foreign universities can get good Prof&#039;s, even IIT&#039;s would. In fact, its easier for them if just funds increase, because of brand name.]]></description>
