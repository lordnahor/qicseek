				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As difficult as it may be difficult to believe to many people, computing is a relatively young discipline.  Until recently, most computing systems received input from people and represented it in cyberspace mostly in form of abstract information.  For efficiency reasons most representations of real world in computing systems captured only application-specific essential abstract aspects of the problem.  These systems were much closer to mathematics which defines operations on numbers representing abstractions of a problem.   Moreover, these systems assumed that a human will transform data from the real physical world or from sensors capturing aspects of real world to the form acceptable to the computing system.  This has been the common mode of input in computing systems even as they evolved from traditional computers to the Web and then included social networks.  Even in those transaction oriented systems where data was directly input in the system, the data was available already in the abstract form compatible with the representations in the computing system.  In a real sense, cyber representations of the real world entered by human beings have been the predominant mode of interfaces for computing systems.</p>
<p>Increasingly, computing systems are expected to interface with different sensors and other information sources directly without the mediation of a human.  Emerging computing systems are expected to  deal with data directly coming from different sensors and from other data sources.  This data could be in the form of GPS coordinates, physical activity levels, flood level, temperature, rainfall rate, heart rates as function of time, photographs, audio, and video.  Clearly all these data may come at different rates and may represent measurements over different regions or people.  Since the system is suppose to take this input directly from sources, without any human mediators, it is important that the system can deal with the representations and the semantics of data.  Using these diverse representations and semantics, the system should be able to extract and deal with information that will help in detecting situations of different kinds and then represent it in representations suitable for reasoning and analysis of situation.</p>
<p>Compared to traditional computing systems, emerging cyber-physical-social systems must deal with diverse real time data streams with different semantics and tied to spatial locations.  The semantics of such data is inherently based on the sensor producing the data, location of the sensor, and the time of measurement.  The system must extract information from this data that is also related to the time and location.  Traditional cyber systems wanted to deal with abstractions that minimized importance of absolute location and time.  In emerging cyber-physical-social systems time and location are independent variables that are used to represent measured, observed, and reported data; in traditional computing systems time and location were made attributes while entities were made independent variables.  These two approaches to representation are significantly different and emphasize different characteristics of the world that we try to model.  </p>
<p>Scientists and engineers dealing with signals and systems learnt to deal with this challenge long time ago.  It was considered natural to maintain multiple representations and use them opportunistically for solving a problem.  The most common example of this is the use of time-domain and frequency-domain analysis and use in designing audio and video systems.  By maintaining and using both representations, one can design systems that help in understanding the requirement and steer the functionality to make these systems more useful for humans.  </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two common buzz words in computing are currently big data and social computing.  As with most new technologies, both these terms mean different things to different people.  </p>
<p>Big data to some people is defined only using the size, to others it has equally important other dimensions such as the variety or heterogeneity of data, speed of generation of new data, and processing requirements.  For every new technology, initially people use it to only extend old applications.  Big data is no different.  Most initial problems are considered related to storage, indexing, search, and visualization.  Much attention is being received by these old problems that definitely become more serious problems as the size and the nature of data changes.  Soon we will see people talking about new problems that are solved by big data and will drive technology development in big data.  Nothing new here, this has happened to almost all revolutionary technologies.  And the same will keep happening in future also.  That is how technology progresses.  After initial incremental applications,  big data will help in solving problems that could not be solved until now.  And that will be the exciting period. </p>
<p>Social computing started becoming a popular area with increasing popularity of social networks, particularly Facebook and Twitter.  One of the reasons for the rapid emergence of social computing as a discipline is availability of large volumes of social data very rapidly.  Before social networks, collection of social data was an expensive and deliberate effort requiring significant amount of time.  Moreover, data-collection techniques functioned in artificial environments and did not necessary reflect a natural state.  Just a few years ago, nobody could imagine that so many people will be contributing so much personal information, opinions about issues, and information related to happenings in the world from mundane to important.  This allows collection of data that was unimaginable related to social behavior as well as issues.  The effect of social media on News is well recognized.  With the popularity of smart phones and applications, so called Apps, one can see another interesting trend.  One can collect data related to people, activities, and events that nobody could imagine.</p>
<p>From ancient times, people have been interested in designing social systems.  I believe that now is the right time to combine Big Data and Social Computing to design unique social systems and applications.  In the following, I will present my early thoughts on this topic to get better clarifications, through my articulation and then feedback from you, on this topic.</p>
