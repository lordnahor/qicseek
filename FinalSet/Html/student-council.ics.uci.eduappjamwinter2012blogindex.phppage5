<div class="content">
<p>The project is about 70% done and we are very excited as we have been steadily coding. We started today at 5 PM and by 11 PM we had a lot done. By midnight we had decided on our plans for the weekend and had individual tasks, and everything planned out. I&#8217;m pretty amazed at our steady progress!</p>
<p>Today was a very interesting day in that we had a lot of individual work done rather than cooperative work. Even though we occasionally bounced ideas around in the room and talked about things we needed help with, we pretty much knew what step to take and so we had pretty much worked on the project individually.</p>
<p>One thing we really should do more is focus on prioritizing components of the application. Even though all of the components are important as of now, I feel that if we do not explicitly prioritize the important parts of the application, we may end up polishing the things that will only influence the quality of the final product by a little bit. If we prioritize, we can do even better than we are now.</p>
<p>We decided to finish our individual tasks for Friday before meeting together on Saturday, since it looks like we are working on things by ourselves anyway.</p>
<p>I wonder what we&#8217;ll accomplish by Saturday morning!</p>

<p>Current Project Status:</p>
<p>Implementation is proceeding slowly and the database back-end is set up.  Once again, we still feel somewhat behind, but we are working hard to catch up.</p>
<p>Progress Today:</p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t realize how long it would take to create all the SQL queries and the associated PHP files and Java files to handle the JSON returns. However on the android side of things, we&#8217;ve finally ironed out all the hiccups we were having and we all have the development environment working and can access the Git repo without getting random merge conflicts.</p>
<p>Challenges:</p>
<p>Working with external android libraries ended up taking forever to set up. We also forgot to make a .gitignore that contained the project properties so every time we pushed it we had merge conflicts as it tried to point to an external library that was somewhere else on everyone&#8217;s computer.</p>

<p>Current Progress status:<br />
Today most of our team assembled in the ICS building at around 7:30, although some of the team members have been working on some of the current goals before then. Things are running smoothly in terms of completing one task after another, the problem is there are still many tasks to complete&#8230;</p>
<p>Progress Today:<br />
The core functionality of our app that we have been working on since the second day has become much more polished and is near completion. There is still a lot to be done in terms of bringing the app together using the functionality that we have created into a product.</p>
<p>Challenges:<br />
Although we have not hit any major roadblocks in terms of completing the tasks, I think that many of us have been underestimating the amount of tasks that this app will require before it is fully complete. We may need to do a better job of planning out what needs to happen each day so that we can have everything that we want and still finish before Monday comes.</p>

<p><strong>Current Project Status:<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Today, most of us (4 out of 5) met up from 6:30pm until exhaustion.  We have assigned responsibilities (design, client side, and back-end) to every person, so we all immediately began our individual work.  The back-end side of our project is only being worked on by one person, but he has been able to catch up to the rest of the teams.  Our communication has been excellent, and we have all been comfortable discussing our project in an effective and orderly manner.  We are using a google document to record our status, to-do lists, and design.   We are still in the early stages in our client side, but we have reached a complete and tangible design which we will be implementing in the next few days.  The rush is building, and we are all excited for what is to come as our last few days approach us.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Today:</strong></p>
<p><em>Android (Client Side):</em></p>
<p>We worked through a ton of issues with running SDK on everyone&#8217;s computer.  We finally started making progress on the client side. We have coded a barebones design of our project and have got it to run on our android devices.  The next few days will be when this section will be picking up.</p>
<p><em>DataBase/Server:</em></p>
<p>Created and completed a fully functional login/registration screen. We also worked on the validation of the logins. We are preparing our database to handle the kind of data our design will be needing.  We also worked on the android-to-database connection.</p>
<p><em>Design:<br />
</em></p>
<p>The design concept of our project has been completed. We planned out a realistic design of our project&#8211;in regards to time constraints.  We also planned a more detailed and complete design if time permits.   Our design has been documented and we are now in the progress of drawing out each individual screen in order to leave the client side of the project with little questions on the design.<br />
<strong><br />
Challenges:</strong></p>
<p>As with other teams, time availability for our members have been a problem.  Today, only one member could not make it to our meeting.  One of our biggest problems have still been with SDK, and solving technical problems with everyone&#8217;s computers.  We also had trouble with simplifying our project so that our design is realistic with the time constraints that we have.</p>

<p><strong>Current Project Status:</strong><br />
Most of the code for the main features of the app is now written. Since we have been able to get most of the basic features in, we hope to finish the basic features on Friday and use Saturday to make some extra features that would benefit the app.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Today:</strong><br />
Today we met at 10:00am on campus and spent most of our time finishing most of the parts we split up on Wednesday to work on. As we finished sections of the code we took on more features, and we ended the day by merging all our code into one project through Mercurial&#8217;s update tools.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong><br />
We ran into a few more bugs, but were able to figure them all out by the end of the day. One of the major challenges for today was to merge our code into one project, but Mercurial helped us to complete the process smoothly.</p>

<p><strong>Current Project Status:<br />
</strong><br />
The app is currently still in the alpha stages. Currently, it seems that the client and design sub-teams are progressing the most. While we have basic function from the server and have implemented a crude information gathering and receiving method, there is still much work to be done in that regard. However, we are very confident now that we will be able to implement the more advanced version of the app. As a side note, team camaraderie and morale is high. As team leader, I&#8217;ve yet to see a group of random individuals who have come together with such dedication to the team, and for that, I&#8217;m very thankful. Sub-team progress will be explained in the sections below.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Today:</strong></p>
<p><em>Android (Client Side):</em><br />
We made a huge advance today in the implementation of our history activity. The history activity will dynamically store a list of feedback that the user needs to receive. As this history depends on the data from the server, it needed to be implemented in a way that would dynamically create the list during run-time. Using the ListActivity and adapter for a ListView we were able to accomplish this task. While this implementation may seem basic to others who have little to no Android experience, the client side team is very proud of our work. While we still do not have all the textual content, the app&#8217;s dummy info and buttons are progressively being replaced by our talented design team&#8217;s custom icons and images.</p>
<p><em>DataBase/Server:</em><br />
The chat activity now has an expanding list that auto-scrolls to the bottom when messages are appended. A mock server has been setup to help test the client-side code for various networking features. The mock server is able to handle parsing and producing the JSON needed for client-server communication. Transmission of the user&#8217;s geographical location to the server has also been setup.</p>
<p><em>Design:<br />
</em>Due to class conflicts and exams, we were not able to meet up with the rest of the team today. We did, however, finish some major design tasks and the rest of the work will simply consist of editing. By the end of the week, all of the designs should be ready to be implemented into the app. The app&#8217;s content is nearly complete. There are only some minor adjustments to be done.<br />
<strong><br />
Challenges:</strong></p>
<p>As this is week 8, a major challenge that we are dealing with is time constraints outside of the project. Two of our five members have midterms and the rest of our team has various projects and labs that they need to finish for their various classes.</p>
<p>Since we are using the GPS instrument in the android device, the emulator is a bit tricky to use during testing. Using the couple of android phones we have is also problematic due to the finicky nature of GPS when working indoors.</p>
<p>The server-side processing system encountered a significant bug today that took a few hours to fix.  We originally decided to use an object database for performance reasons. We were also happy that we did not have to bother with object-relational mapping. Unfortunately, however, the free object database that we chose was causing us trouble from the beginning. We finally decided to throw it out and use MySQL. Luckily the object database system was based on the standard Java Persistence API so we were able to switch our underlying implementation to MySQL without needing to change our code! We just had to add the object-relational mapping and the system was back up and bug free!</p>

<p><strong>Current Status:</strong></p>
<p>Thus far we have finished most of the interface and the database but we still need to store the data into the app. We also found someone who is willing to lead his android device for us to test our app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Progress today:</strong></p>
<p>Most of the coding is complete, and we have made plans to meet up tomorrow for a status update. In addition, we are still working on the algorithm needed to ensure that the app works properly. Also, since each team member works on certain parts of the code we downloaded a plugin for eclipse to make sure that the project on each team members’ computer is of the same version.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<p>So far, the challenges have been in developing the algorithm properly, collecting and transferring the data to the activities, and coming up with the best thresholds.</p>

<p><strong>Current Project Status:<br />
</strong>We have been using Google Docs and created a Facebook Group in order to better communicate with each other on the progress of each team. Meeting in person has become difficult with the varying schedules and midterm week but through Facebook we can still maintain contact.  Our applications purpose and function has been decided and the purpose it will serve for the users is finalized, now we will have to work on implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Today</strong>:<br />
The team could not get together today because of conflicting schedules but we resolved to meet on Friday and spend all weekend together. Today, individually, team members continued their research in order to facilitate the meetings over the weekend. The coding behind finger gestures as well as the different variations that will be possible in terms of touch screen and coding behind it was worked on. The application will be dependent on notifying specific users of any updates and the data will be on the server so the notification of client through C2DM was researched. The Post/Get for PHP was also researched. We also received confirmation of the creation of our webspace and access to MySQL from our Team Advisor.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong><br />
We have to solidify our understanding of the PHP, C2DM, and Code implementation and we will work on that so that the weekend code session goes smoother. The Canvas and JSON is proving to be difficult but we are going to work long hours on Saturday and Sunday to hopefully have a finished project by Sunday night.</p>
