<h2>Draft Specification for Missingness Handeling</h2>

<p>We are currently interested in -<i> sexual contact life-history data</i>. Through this description there might be terms from that content. A tie might be referred to <i> a relationship</i>, a vertex that tie to another might be referred as <i> a partner </i>.</p>

<h3> Missingness introduced by different designs</h3>

<h4>Case I. Ties over a length T interval</h4>

<p> Suppose in the survey, we ask egos to provide all ties over a length T interval. If left censoring occurs then any onsets that are earlier than the lower threshold t_l will be recorded as t_l. Similarly if right censoring occurs then any termini that are later than the upper threshold t_u will be recorded as t_u. In this case one of the start and the end time might be missing for some times. </p>

<h4>Case II. Snapshots of network instances</h4> 
<p> Interval censoring occurs when the dataset consists a series of snapshots of the network instances. Onsets and termini are somewhere between two consecutive timestamps but the exact values are unkown. A example of this censoring would be, if we capture a person's friends on Facebook every week, and we observe a new friendship at week 5. Then we know the time the ego starts a friendship with this alter between week 4 and 5, but we can not observe the exact time.</p>


<h4>Case III. Last K ties</h4>
<p> Suppose in the survey, an ego is asked to provide the last K ties that he/she either is currently tied with, or have most recently ended a tie with. In this case the co-occurance ties are unknown before the end time of the last tie. 
</p>

 
<h3> Model Spec (draft)</h3>
<p>Here we assume the full population is ID'ed, which means the two subjects form each tie can be identified. 
</p>

<p> Requirments:
<ol> 
<li> MH should be compatible with the networkDynamic framework.</li>
<li> In general, we should only store the ties that are known to be active. The missingness should be handled only when a network snapshot is queried at a specific time.</li>
</ol>


<p> <b> ### To add: focus on "Store the missing data" and "Represent the missing data (when query) ###</b><p> 


<h4> Case I: Ties over length T interval</h4>

<p>
Parameters:
<ol>
<li> ties : in spell list format (allow other input format?)
<li> start/end time of the survey
<li> left/right censoring : logical or string indicator
</ol>

<i> Question: If the a time instance which is earlier the start, does having a tie start at the start time give any information to the queried time? see question section (2)</i> 
</p>

<p> <b> Storage: </b>  In networkDynamic objects the edge information is stored in the edge list with together activation information. We can represent the edge with as -Inf if we determine it is left censored and Inf if it is right censored. </p>

<p> <b> Query: </b> As mentioned in the question earlier, (also question section 2). For now we do not place any inference when query the network at a specific time. That is, if a time before or aftet the upper or lower threshold is queried, then we return NA (unknown) on all possible spells.
</p>

<h4> Case II: Snapshots of network instances</h4> 




<p> Parameters:
<table class = "parameters">
<tr>
<td> x </td>
<td> list of network objects or adjacency matrices. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td> at</td>
<td>vector stores the timestamps when the above network objects or adjecency matrices are captured. length(at) = length(x).</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h5> Desired properties</h5>
<p> Suppose network at time t is queried. <br>

<ol> 
<li>  Egos and alters are ID'ed.</li>
<li>  All vertices appear in all network instances. No adding or deleting vertices over time.</li>
<li>  Vertex attributes are also fixed over time.</li>
</ol>




<ol> if t is not in at, but in between 2 consecutive at values 
	<ol>if interpolation is set to be TRUE
		<ol> if a tie is active in both left and right consecutive networks, return 1 for the tie.<br> 
		If a tie is not active in both of the networks, return 0.
		<br> If a ties shows in one of them, return NA.(Also return if the active snapshot is the left or the right?)</ol>
	</ol>
	<ol> if interpolation is FALSE
		<ol> Return the network with vertices, vertex attributes and an empty adjacency matrix. Together with a matrix indicate wether each tie is:
		<li> "BOTH" : active in both left and right consecutive snapshots.
		<li> "NONE" : active in none of the two snapshots.
		<li> "LEFT" : active in the left snapshot, but not in the right.		<li> "RIGHT": active in the right snapshot, but not in the left.
		</ol>
	</ol>
</ol>


<h5> Existing functions</h5>
<p>"networkDynamic" constructor functioe has similar properties. It takes a list of network objects (network.list) and timing information (onset &#38 termini) to construct a networkDynamic object. Suppose A network at time t is queried using network.extract(.., at = t), when the t is not covered by the onset and termini, if parameter "retain.all.vertices" is set to be TRUE, it returns a network object with all vertices and an empty adjancy matrix, otherwise returns an empty list. </p>
<p>Changes are made to "network.extract" function. Temporarily named "network.capture". Later this two functions can be merged together.</p>

<h4> Case III: Last K ties </h4>
<p> Parameters </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------<br>
Questions
<p>
<p> 1. 
Assume the dataset is unsatuated (the full population is not observed). When we collect past K ties information, how do we represent the missingness? </p>

<p> 2. Assume we record an ego's ties over a length T interval. If the tie with alter A starts before the threshold then we record the start time of the tie with A to be the threshold -the start time of the tie is missing. How do we represent this type of missingness? My thoughts are that when query the network instance before the lower threshold, the adjacency matrix returned would have an  NA (indicate missing) value where the ego and A had a tie. however this could be problematic, since then we can argue that we shoud have NA value for all other ties.  </p>
