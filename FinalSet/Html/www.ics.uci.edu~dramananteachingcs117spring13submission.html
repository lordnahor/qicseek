<h1>Project submission guidelines</h1>


<h3>Due dates/late policy</h3>

Projects (or equivalenty homeworks) will only be accepted electronically through the EEE dropbox. The dropbox will have a automatic deadline of 12:30 pm on the given due date. <i> No homeworks will be accepted after that time</i>. I know this is a tough requirement, but in return, I'll award extra credit for early-submitted homeworks as described below. If you are working down to the last minute, <b> please </b> make sure something is uploaded 10 minutes prior to the deadline to ensure you won't get zero credit.


<h3>Grading</h3>

Each assignment has both programming and written components.  Your
code will be graded both on clarity and correctness.  
It is generally more important that your code be clear and
correct than fast.  Your writeup should 
be richly illustrated with graphs and images, and your code
should be well commented and documented.

<h3>Extra-credit</h3>      
Any homework that is handed in 24 hours early will get 5% extra-credit - e.g., 5 points for a 100-point assignment.
    

<h3>Homework Submission Instructions</h3>


<p> Submit a zip or tar archive containing your code and your writeup into the appropriate folder (e.g., submit Homework1 to the "HW1" folder)  in the <tt>EEE Dropbox</tt>.  Use the following directory structure:
      
<blockquote><tt><pre>
YourName/code
YourName/writeup.pdf
</pre></tt></blockquote>

<p>
The <tt>code</tt> subdirectory should contain all of your code.  Include
everything that your code needs to run.  If I hand out code as part of the
assignment, include that also.


<p>

Zip the <tt>YourName</tt>  directory and upload <tt>YourName.zip</tt>
to the EEE dropbox under the folder for the given project.
You can create a zip archive of the <tt>YourName</tt> directory in various ways:
<p>

<ul>
  <li> Right-click on the folder and select "Create archive".
  Select either "zip" or "tar.gz" to create the archive, or
  <li> In a terminal, cd to the directory
  containing <tt>YourName</tt> and type <tt>zip -r YourName
  YourName</tt> to create <tt>YourName.zip</tt>
</ul>

<p>You can list the contents of a zip archive with the command
<tt>unzip -l YourName</tt>

<h3>Homework Writeup Guidelines</h3>

<p>
You must submit your writeups as as a single PDF document following
this <a href="template/index.html">template</a>. PDFs are
cross-platform formats for encoding documents with text and
images. Most word processors (MS Word, Open Office, Apple's Pages)
can export PDFs. <em>I will not accept writeups in any word processing format such as MS Word or Open Office.</em>  
            
     
<p>Some guidelines for your figures:

<ul>
	
  <!--
  <p><li><b>Always show the colorbar for 2D data.</b>  Whether your are
  showing an image or data in the form of an image, always show the
  colorbar.  If you are showing an image, this will verify that the
  color map spans the correct range (usually <tt>[0,1]</tt>).  If
  you are showing data, then this will show the meaning of the colors.
  The only exception is when you show RGB images; in that case, the
  colorbar is meaningless because the colormap is not used.
	
  <p><li><b>Use a sensible color map.</b>  There are 3 standard color
  maps available to you: <tt>gray</tt>, <tt>jet</tt>,
  and <tt>hsv</tt>.  In the few cases where your data is periodic
  (such as with angles), then use <tt>colormap hsv</tt>.  Otherwise,
  use <tt>gray</tt> or <tt>jet</tt>.  Which is appropriate
  depends on what you are trying to show.  Use the colormap that most
  effectively communicates your point.

  <p><li><b>Use a proper display range.</b>  If you are showing a
  grayscale image, make sure that MATLAB does not remap the colors.
  The <tt>imagesc</tt> command has an optional parameter for this
  purpose, e.g. <tt>imagesc(im,[0,1])</tt> will make sure the color
  map spans the range <tt>[0,1]</tt>.  If you are showing data, then
  allowing <tt>imagesc</tt> to scale the color map to the range of
  the data is usually appropriate.  If your data is mostly symmetric
  around zero, then consider using a display range that is symmetric
  around zero,
  e.g. <nobr><tt>imagesc(im,[-1,1]*max(abs(im(:))))</tt></nobr>	
  -->

  <p><li><b>Use imwrite() for saving images.</b>  To directly export
  an image from Matlab, use the <tt>imwrite</tt> command.  

  <p><li><b> Exporting figures. </b> Sometimes, you will plot lines/shapes over images in a figure window. To export a
  figure window (containing an images with overlaid markings): Select
  File > Save As... from the figure window, and export as an image (PNG, TIFF, JPG, etc.).
  
  <p><li><b>Use a proper size and aspect ratio for exported
figures.</b> Use the <tt>axis image</tt> command in MATLAB to make sure that pixels
are displayed square.  If the image is not too large, ensure that image and screen pixels coincide with the <tt>truesize</tt> command.

  <p><li><b> Make sure images in writeup are properly sized</b>. Large
images do not belong in your writeup. If you need to show image
details in a figure, then show another image with a zoomed-in portion of the image.
