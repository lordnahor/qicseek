<P>
BibGene is a
<A HREF="http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~darley/MacBibTeX.html">BibTeX</A>-compatible 
Macintosh application for maintaining databases of references to scientific 
papers.  BibGene was designed with two purposes:
<UL>
<P><LI>To maintain BibTeX information in a cross-linked object-oriented 
format which makes it easier to detect and correct common mistakes such as 
multiple spellings of an author's or journal's name.

<P><LI>To provide a way to store information that does not fit well into 
the BibTeX framework, such as citations from one paper to another, pointers 
to online preprints, and author addresses.
</UL>

BibGene is freeware, and may be freely distributed and included on CD-ROMs.

<H2>Release Notes</H2>

The main new feature 
in BibGene 1.1 is an Eprint card, for maintaining information about 
electronic preprints on archives such as the one at xxx.lanl.gov.  Adding 
an Eprint card to a document causes an "eprint=..." line to be added to 
each BibTeX record for the document, and also (if the Eprint archive is 
set) creates another record of type "@misc" for the eprint itself.

<P>Other smaller bugfixes and improvements include:
<UL>
	<LI>Fixing bugs in BibTeX import, including a crashing bug if
	BibGene was started by dragging a BibTeX file onto it.
	<LI>Improved default filenames for reports and BibTeX export.
	<LI>Report HTML output now makes HTML 4.0 headers and sets
	file creator code to Apple Browser Launcher.
	<LI>Fix bug when saving file on shared filesystem.
</UL>

<H2>Using BibGene</H2>

<P>To load a BibTeX file into BibGene, drag it onto the BibGene application.
You may also use BibGene's <tt>Open</tt> command (cmd-L), or select it in the 
dialog that BibGene starts up with, if you uncheck the box marked "Show 
Only BibGene Files".  Use the Export command (cmd-E) to save the database 
as a BibTeX file.  BibGene's Save command (cmd-S) instead creates a file 
in BibGene's own internal format.

<P>As its icon indicates, BibGene displays information in <I>cards</I>, 
each of which is divided into three <I>panes</I>.  The top pane, the 
<I>fields</I>, contains structured information such as the names of other 
cards.  The second pane, the <I>links</I>, lists other cards containing 
this card's name in their fields.  The third pane, the <I>text</I> contains 
free-form text.  To change the information in a BibGene database, simply 
select a field or text pane and type the new value you wish to place there.
You can not type into the links pane; instead, it is updated automatically 
when other cards are changed.

<P>BibGene's database engine and user interface are taken from
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/gene/">Gene</A>, a popular 
shareware program for maintaining family history information.
For more detailed information on how to use BibGene, and on how BibGene 
files are formatted, see the Gene User Guide and Technical Notes,
available from the <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/gene/">Gene 
home page</A>.  We list here some quick tips on usage that might not 
otherwise be obvious:

<UL>
<P><LI>To change e.g. the spelling of a the title of a paper, you need 
only change the <tt>Title</tt> field in the <tt>Document</tt> card;
all other cards referring to that paper will be automatically updated.
Do not attempt to change the spelling by retyping the name in the 
<tt>Publication</tt> card, because that will create a new <tt>Document</tt> 
card without deleting the old Document or updating other publications that 
refer to it.  The same applies to any other situation in which some fields 
refer to the names of other fields: always change the name on the original 
card, not the fields that refer to it on other cards.

<P><LI>The most convenient way to add cards that relate to existing parts 
of your database is with the <tt>Templates</tt> submenu of the 
<tt>Cards</tt> menu.  The commands in this submenu create new cards with 
some values already filled in, based on the existing card you are currently 
viewing.  Many templates have keyboard shortcuts.  For instance, to create 
a new paper by an author already in your database, open the author's card 
and type cmd-D.

<P><LI>You can search for any substring of a name of a card (such as an 
author's name or document title) by typing the substring into the list of 
card names obtained by the <tt>List Cards</tt> command in the 
<tt>Cards</tt> menu.  The same search feature also works for on-screen 
displays of reports.

<P><LI>You can produce BibTeX files for a subset of your database by using 
the <tt>Report</tt> command (cmd-R).  Open the card for an author or location you wish to 
select the papers of, and select the <tt>Preview BibTeX</tt> report,
with output style <tt>Simple Text</tt>.  BibGene will then output the 
BibTeX preview to a text file which can be used as input to BibTeX.

<P><LI>If a field is restricted to a limited set of values
(such as the <tt>BibTeX type</tt> field of a <tt>Publication</tt> card),
you can click on the field name to produce a pop-up menu of those values.
If a field contains the name of another card,
clicking on the field name will instead open that other card.

<P><LI>If a field is used for the name of another card
(such as the <tt>Document</tt> field of a <tt>Publication</tt> card),
you only need to type enough of the name to uniquely identify it,
then press the tab key to complete the name.

<P><LI>If you have typed some text into a field, but not yet typed return, 
you may cancel your changes with cmd-period.
</UL>

<H2>BibGene's Cards and Fields</H2>

In order to use BibGene effectively, you need to know what information it 
expects to see in each of its types of cards, and how that information will 
be copied into the BibTeX files it produces.  We list here each of 
BibGene's cards and the expected content of their fields.  It is assumed 
that you already understand BibTeX format.

<DL>
<P><DT><B>Author</B></DT>
<DD>The name and contact information for a person who wrote a paper.
It has the following fields:
<UL>
<LI><tt>Author</tt>. The author's name, also used as the name of the Author 
card.  Accented characters should be 
typed with the option key as in any other Macintosh program; they will be 
translated to TeX when exported to BibTeX.  Names may be either 
first-name-first ("David Eppstein") or last-name-first ("Eppstein, David").
If the surname consists of multiple words, and the name is listed 
first-name-first, the words should be separated by option-spaces so that 
BibGene can know to alphabetize the name correctly.  Modifiers such as 
"Jr." may be placed after the name (e.g. "Kenneth E. Hoff III"; do not use 
a comma).  No two Author cards may have the same name in their Author fields.
<LI>The <tt>Organization</tt> lists the university or research lab with 
which an author is associated.  May be left blank; will not be exported to 
BibTeX.
<LI>The <tt>Home Page</tt> and <tt>Email</tt> fields list electronic 
contact information for the author.
May be left blank; will not be exported to BibTeX.
</UL></DD>

<P><DT><B>Citation</B></DT>
<DD>This card indicates that one paper cites another
(e.g. as listed in <I>Science Citation Index</I>).
It is not exported to BibTeX.
It has the following fields:
<UL>
<LI><tt>From</tt>. The title of the paper containing the citation.
Must be the name of a <I>Document</I> card.
<LI><tt>To</tt>. The title of the paper listed in the citation.
Must be the name of a <I>Document</I> card.
<LI><tt>Citing versions</tt>.  A list of BibTeX tags separated by 
semicolons.  Should refer to the paper whose title appears in the 
<tt>From</tt> field. May be left blank.
<LI><tt>Cited versions</tt>.  A list of BibTeX tags separated by 
semicolons.  Should refer to the paper whose title appears in the 
<tt>To</tt> field. May be left blank.
<LI><tt>Date</tt>.  The date of first publication of the citing paper.
Used to sort citations in the links pane and in the <tt>Count 
Citations</tt> report.
</UL></DD>

<P>
<DT><B>Document</B></DT>
<DD>This card lists the title and authors of a 
paper. A single paper may occur in multiple publication records, e.g. if it 
has technical report, conference, and journal versions. A <tt>Document</tt> 
card has the following fields:
<UL>
<LI><tt>Title</tt>.  The title of the paper.  It should be capitalized 
exactly the way you want it to appear in the bibliography; BibGene 
exports it surrounded by extra brackets to preserve the capitalization. 
This is used as the name of the <tt>Document</tt> card, so no two cards 
may have the same title, even though it is possible for two actual 
papers to have the same title.  If you need to refer to two different 
papers with the same title, you can avoid name conflicts by modifying 
the title in this card, without changing the way it appears in the 
bibliography, e.g. by replacing spaces by option-spaces, or by adding 
extra curly brackets around some characters.
<LI><tt>Authors</tt>.  A list of author names, separated by semicolons.
Each name must be listed in a separate <tt>Author</tt> card.
<LI><tt>Keywords</tt>.  A list of keywords or key phrases, separated by semicolons.
Optional. Each keyword must be listed in a separate <tt>Author</tt> card.
</UL>
When exporting a BibTeX file, BibGene will look for a special Document card 
with the title "(preamble)".  If found, the text pane of that card will be 
included in the BibTeX file before any publication records.
</DD>

<P>
<DT><B>Eprint</B></DT>
<DD>This card lists information about the inclusion of a paper in an 
online preprint archive such as xxx.lanl.gov.
Its fields are the archive's identifier for the paper,
the title of the paper, the archive name, and the date of electronic 
publication.
If an eprint card exists for a paper, a line eprint={identifier} will be included 
in any BibTeX entry for that paper; in addition, Gene will create a BibTeX 
entry for the eprint itself, using the identifier as the BibTeX tag.</DD>

<P>
<DT><B>Keyword</B></DT>
<DD>A word or phrase occurring in the <tt>Keywords</tt> field of a 
<tt>Document</tt> card.  Its one field contains the keyword or key phrase,
and is used as the name of the <tt>Keyword</tt> card; no two cards can 
have the same name.</DD>


<P>
<DT><B>Location</B></DT>
<DD>A journal, proceedings title, series of books, or other collection in 
which references might be published.  Location cards can also be used to 
set <tt>type=...</tt> and <tt>howpublished=...</tt> fields in BibTeX 
entries.
A location card has the following fields:
<UL>
<LI><tt>Location</tt>.  The name of the journal, or title of the book or 
series.  Also used as the name of the Location card; no two cards can have 
the same name.
<LI><tt>Type</tt>.  Which BibTeX tag to use in referring to this location, 
e.g. <tt>booktitle=...</tt> or <tt>journal=...</tt>.  This should always be 
set, but if it isn't, <tt>journal</tt> is assumed.
<LI><tt>Publisher</tt>.  The company or institution which published the 
book or journal.  If not blank, this must be the name of an 
<tt>Organization</tt> card.
<LI><tt>Series</tt>.  If this location is a book or conference proceedings,
this field can be used to list the book series in which it was published.
It should be the name of another <tt>Location</tt> card.
<LI><tt>Number</tt>.  The book's number in the series.  Should be blank if 
the <tt>Series</tt> field is blank.
<LI><tt>Editor</tt>.  The editor of the book.
You can include this for journals too, but most bibliographic styles don't.
Should be the name of an <tt>Author</tt> card.
</UL></DD>

<P>
<DT><B>Organization</B></DT>
<DD>A corporation, university department, or other publisher of books and 
papers.  It has the following fields:
<UL>
<LI>The <tt>Organization</tt> field gives the name of the organization, and 
is also used as the name of the card.  No two <tt>Organization</tt> cards can have 
the same name.
<LI>The <tt>Address</tt> lists the city or other contact information of the 
organization.  Note that, if an organization is used in a 
<tt>Publication</tt> card with an <tt>Org Type</tt> of <tt>address</tt>,
the address should go in the Organization field, not here.
<LI>The <tt>Home Page</tt> lists electronic contact information for the 
organization.
</UL></DD>

<P><DT><B>Pub Info</B></DT>
<DD>These cards are used to record BibTeX information that does not 
otherwise fit cleanly into BibGene's data model.  A <tt>Pub Info</tt> card 
has the following fields:
<UL>
<LI><tt>Document</tt>.  The title of the document the information refers 
to.
<LI><tt>Version</tt>.  If the information is valid only for one of the 
instances in which this document was published, this field should give the 
<tt>BibTeX tag</tt> of the appropriate publication record.
<LI><tt>BibTeX key</tt>.  What keyword to use when listing this 
information.  E.g. to produce a line "month={Spring/Summer}", this field 
should contain the word "month".
</UL>
The text pane of this card is used as the data in the BibTeX line it 
produces.  In the same example, the text should be "Spring/Summer".</DD>

<P><DT><B>Publication</B></DT>
<DD>These cards are the most important components of a BibGene file;
each publication card corresponds to a BibTeX record.
It has the following fields:
<UL>
<LI>The <tt>BibTeX tag</tt> is used as the record identifier in the BibTeX 
file, and as the name of the publication card.  No two publication cards 
may have the same BibTeX tag.
<LI>The <tt>BibTeX type</tt> gives the type of 
publication for this record, and must be one of the types predefined in 
BibTeX such as <tt>article</tt> or <tt>inproceedings</tt>.
<LI>The 
<tt>Document</tt> gives the title of the paper, and must be the name of a 
<tt>Document</tt> card.
<LI>The <tt>Location</tt> gives the place in which the 
paper was published (such as a journal, conference proceedings title, or 
book series) 
and must be the name of a <tt>Location</tt> card.  The Location may be 
blank e.g. for a technical report or thesis.
<LI>The <tt>Organization</tt> 
gives the name of a publisher, school, or other organization publishing 
the paper, and must be the name of an <tt>Organization</tt> card; it may be 
blank e.g. if the publisher is unknown or is listed in the location card.
<LI>The <tt>Organization Type</tt> is used to determine which BibTeX tag
to use when exporting the Organization; e.g. a university might be listed 
as <tt>school=...</tt> for a thesis but <tt>institution=...</tt> for a 
technical report.  The Organization Type should be blank if the 
organization is blank.
<LI>The <tt>Cross Ref</tt> lists the BibTeX tag of another publication 
entry giving further information about this publication.  We do not 
recommend using this field in new databases but it is needed for 
importing old cross-referenced BibTeX files.
<LI>The <tt>Volume</tt> is the volume of the journal or multi-volume book 
in which the paper was published.
<LI>The <tt>Number</tt> is the issue number of the journal, or series 
number of the book in which the paper was published.
<LI>The <tt>Pages</tt> gives the page numbers of the paper in its 
publication location.  Some BibTeX users also use this field to denote the 
total number of pages in a book.
<LI>The <tt>Date</tt> gives the date of publication.  Note that unlike 
BibTeX we do not split the date into separate month and year fields.
The date must fit a fixed format in which
certain date values such as "Spring/Summer 1998" can not be represented;
if you need to use such dates, the year should be placed in this field and
the month should be in a separate <tt>Pub Info</tt> card.
</UL>
If the text pane of a publication card is non-empty, it is exported to a 
<tt>note</tt> line in the BibTeX file.</DD>

<P><DT><B>Review</B></DT>
<DD>This is a special kind of Publication card used to record publications 
that review other publications (for instance, in journals such as <I>Math. 
Reviews</I>).  It has the following fields:
<UL>
<LI><tt>Document</tt>. The title of the paper under 
review.
<LI><tt>Version</tt>.  The <tt>BibTeX tag</tt> of the particular 
publication of the paper used in this review.
<LI><tt>Reviewer</tt>.  The name of the author of the review, if the 
review was signed.  Should be the name of an <tt>Author</tt> card, or 
multiple names separated by semicolons.
<LI><tt>Location</tt>.  The name of the journal in which the reviews were 
published.
<LI><tt>Volume, Number, Pages, Date</tt>. Same as for publication cards.
However a review might have a number within an issue of a review journal;
if so, that should go in the <tt>Number</tt> field.
For instance reviews in <I>Math. Reviews</I> should be listed with a 
<tt>Volume</tt> like "91a" and a <tt>Number</tt> like "68125".
</UL>
When exporting to BibTeX, BibGene will make up a BibTeX tag for the review 
based on the location, volume, and number.
</DD>

<P><DT><B>URL</B></DT>
<DD>The online location of a paper.
It has the following fields:
<UL>
<LI><tt>Document</tt>. The title of the paper that is available online.
<LI><tt>Version</tt>.  If the online preprint reproduces some particular 
print publication, this field should give the <tt>BibTeX tag</tt> of the 
corresponding publication record.
<LI><tt>URL</tt>. The Uniform Resource Locator specifying how to retrieve 
the paper from the internet.  Also used as the name of the URL card.  No 
two URL cards can have the same name.
<LI><tt>Last modified</tt>. Optional.  Date at which the most recent update 
to this preprint was made.
<LI><tt>Last visited</tt>. Optional.  Date at which the BibGene user most 
recently verified that the URL was still valid.
