		<description><![CDATA[Computer vision is possibly the most challenging aspect of image processing, and the number of different sources and fields of studies makes it a stimulating, yet not simple, research area. The concern about â€œhow to extract and utilize visual information in large systemsâ€ can now have support from different computer applications, which are able to complement the human visual system. Theories and ideas from different study fields are required for an improved research on computer vision, therefore information tools can help gathering the information collected and creating a proper database. Thinking about that, I believe you could consult Ask Dr. Tech, a company that has expert knowledge in areas such as administration with high performance levels and system maintenance. Their IT and system operation knowledge could add up to the research. http://www.askdrtech.com/]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[...] Leggendo i blog di MarcoB e Ramesh Jain mi sono accorto che la computervision Ã¨ una vecchia scienza in un certo senso matura perchÃ¨ molte delle cose interessanti sono state giÃ  fatte (leggetevi per esempio cosa scriveva giÃ  nel 2006 Marco su Riya Hard Discount, sul fingerprinting e piÃ¹ recentemente sul riconoscimento delle facce in Google Images) e in un altro senso acerba perchÃ¨ incapace di tenere testa alle alte aspettative perchÃ¨ si Ã¨ sviluppata frammentata, come scrive Ramesh Jain qui.
