Three neat Web finds:

subjects</A> such as anarchy, angst, and rainbow gatherings.

very own page full of pictures and information on the Web.
<li>Anyone interested in 
<A HREF= "http://dao.gsfc.nasa.gov/hpcc/overview.html">four-dimensional data

<LI><A NAME="QQ1"><B>Where can I find a list of Sociology Journals and Magazines on the Web, and especially on Post-Modern culture? </B></A>
There is an interesting list of 
<A HREF= 
"http://coombs.anu.edu.au/CoombswebPages/CoombsEJrnls-Register.html"> 
worldwide journals of sociology</A>, ranging 
from numerous schools and locals from all around the world, that is put 
out on the World Wide Web by the Australian National University(ANU). 
This list may prove useful to all interested in research in sociology 
and in the social sciences in general. Of particular interest to those 
intrigued by <A HREF=
http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/pmc/contents.194.html>postmodern 
culture</A> is a journal eminating from the 
University of Virginia. This journal page may also include other links 
to sites of similar interest. Enjoy.<p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to 
list of questions.</it></a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ2"><B>What is SGML and what does it have to do with HTML?</B></A>
SGML, or <A HREF= "http://nearnet.gnn.com/wic/comput.39.html"> Standard 
Generalized Markup Language</A>, is a general language used 
for text information processing. It was adopted for this purpose as an 
international standard, by the name ISO 8879. Its underlying goal is to 
facilitate efficient distribution and retrieval of information in a 
generalized language that will not mandate a specific appearance or 
interpretation by the client. The SGML standard actually defines the 
markup language used in creating and disseminating hypertext documents 
in Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML. HTML defines the 
<A HREF= "http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/MarkUp.html">structure of 
a hypertext document</A> such that any client can interpret it according to 
its program's capabilities. Thus, HTML takes the basic philosophy of 
generating a flexible markup language and applies it to hypertext and 
multimedia systems such as the World Wide Web.<p><A 
HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ3"><B>How can I find out about graduate schools in my major, and especially how can I get more information on the University of Washington?</B></A>
There is a fairly comprehensive list of 
<A HREF= "http://www.clas.ufl.edu/CLAS/american-universities.html">American 
Universities</A> available 
on the World Wide Web which is put out by Mike Conlon at the University 
of Florida. Each link is a name of an American University and takes you 
to that schools home page, or occassionally to a departmental home 
page. For an even more comprehensive and extensive list of worldwide 
University links, there is a fine list of international universities 
which comes from MIT. Both of these pages will attempt to provide 
the viewer with a link that will provide access to other departments 
and resources at the university you choose. For example, the 
<A HREF= "http://www.cac.washington.edu:1180/">University 
of Washington's</A> home page is exquisitevely laid out and gives 
references to its various schools, departments, and sponsored 
activities.<p><A 
HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ4"><B>Where can I get more some inside information on 
Stephen Franklin and get access to his vast informational resources on the 
Web, thus aiding my education in this class tenfold?</B></A>
One can get access to the world renowned and illustrious mentor of the 
"many" through the department which is simply too small to contain his 
ever abounding informational capacity. Namely, one can click onto 
<A HREF= "http://www.oac.uci.edu/indiv/franklin/">Franklin's home page</A> 
here which comes from the Office of Academic 
Computing at the University of California Irvine. If one wants to 
bypass his home page, which I certainly do not suggest given his 
grinning mug will greet you there, one can link directly onto 
<A HREF= "http://www.oac.uci.edu/indiv/franklin/hotlist.html">his 
own personal hotlist</A>. Here you will find an extensive and highly useful 
array of the resources and Web documents that made our hero everything 
that he is.  By accessing this vast repetoire of greatness, we may be 
able to take over his ICS 1C class by exhibiting our own superior expertise 
and knowledge of the World Wide Web. Good luck comrades and viva la 
revolucion.....<p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of

<LI><A NAME="QQ5"><B>Where can I find out more about Extropians and better yet, what/who in the world is it?</B></A>
The best place to find out more about 
<A 
HREF= 
"http://www.acm.usl.edu/~dca6381/c2_mirror/faq/exifaq.html">Extropians</A> is 
to go directly to the 
source, or rather to the document on the Web entitled Frequently Asked 
Questions on Extropians. Extropianism is actually more of a mindset rather 
than a platform of concrete and hard held ideas. They are most interested 
in exploration of life and its many facets with a particular emphasis on 
technology as a means of bridging political and social differences. 
Extropians, ultimately then, or perpetual and self sustained optimistic 
explorers who tend not to hold any particular allegiances while 
advocating infinite creativity and total and boundless expansion. This is 
not to say there are no 
<A HREF= "http://www.acm.usl.edu/~dca6381/c2_mirror/princip.html">Extropian 
principles</A> to be unearthed in such a 
morass of "liberation theology". Extropians are intimately tied to 
humanism in its philisophical base(feeling that the "supernatural" and/or 
whatever is considered "outside" the range of human knowledge or power is 
ultimately a pointless and backward unit of study), but attempt to 
transcend the limits of humanism. Thus, they term themselves as 
"transhumanists", they believe that we can transcend physical limitations 
of our biology, culture and environment through the wise and creative use 
of science and technology. <p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of
