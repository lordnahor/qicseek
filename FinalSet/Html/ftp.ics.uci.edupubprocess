UCI Process research focuses on providing a flexible process modeling and
execution environment to help improve coordination and managerial control,
and techniques for collecting application usage data over the Internet to
help inform the development process.

<H3>Endeavors Process Execution Environment</H3>

<A HREF="/pub/endeavors/endeavors.html">Endeavors</a> is an open, distributed, extensible
process execution environment. It is designed to improve coordination and
managerial control of development teams by allowing flexible definition,
modeling, and execution of typical workflow applications.  This site includes
the latest Endeavors releases, on-line documentation, presentations,
publications, and more.

<H3>EDEM: Expectation-Driven Event Monitoring</H3>

<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dhilbert/edem/">Expectation-Driven Event
Monitoring (EDEM)</A> is an approach and an agent-based architecture for
collecting application usage data over the Internet on a potentially large
and ongoing basis.  EDEM allows developers of interactive systems to collect
information that is currently lost regarding application usage, thereby
contributing to a more empirically grounded development process.
This site includes software, demos, presentations, and publications.

<H3>Future Endeavors</H3>
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/endeavors/FutureEndeavors.html#PPA"><B>Petri-net Process Analysis</B></A> is a tool to convert control flow based workflows into Petri-nets and perform analysis on workflow attributes.
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/endeavors/FutureEndeavors.html#RealityCheck"></b>Reality Check</B></A> analyses instance data generated by adaptive workflow management tools and creates generalized processes.
