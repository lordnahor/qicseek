The following is a list of zipped Eclipse project files (more might be added
  during the quarter).
Please feel free to download, unzip, run, and study these scripts (both their
  code and their run-time behavior).
Programmers gain tremendous insight into all facets of programming by studying
  the code of other programmers (especially those with more experience; and I
  am happy to improve my code based on your observations -nothing is perfect).
A good programmer typically makes elegant use of the required language
  features, resulting in smaller, more elegant code.
<p>
All downloadable projects are listed alphabetically; you can also search this
  page for keywords.
All are zip files, so unzip them first.
Most project files require the
  Download: <a href="../common/online.html">standard course library</a>
  which contains a variety of useful modules.
If you followed the Eclipse installation instructions, you should have already
  created the <b>courselib</b> folder in your workspace and populated it with
  these modules.

Download: <a href="programs/collatz.zip">Collatz Conjecture</a><br>
The Collatz conjecture states: starting with any positive number, repeat the
  process "If it is even, halve it; if it is odd, multiply it by three and
  add one" and eventually the remaining value reduces to one.
No one has been able to prove this conjecture, but a short script allows us
  to investigate it (and others have examined billions of different values
  and found no counterexamples).
It is interesting to observe the number of cycles required to reduce the
  starting number to 1, looking for a pattern.
This script is highlighted in the
  <a href="../common/debugger/debugger.doc">debugger handout</a>.

Download: <a href="programs/craps.zip">
  Craps Statistics</a><br>
This script prompts the user for the number of craps games to play (craps
  is a dice game whose rules are explained in the block comment at the top
  of this script).
It then simulates that many games of craps, printing the number (and percentage)
  of wins, losses, dice throws (and average dice throws per game), elapsed
  time, and game playing speed.
This script is used inthe problem set for the
  <a href="../common/debugger/debugger.doc">debugger handout</a>.
