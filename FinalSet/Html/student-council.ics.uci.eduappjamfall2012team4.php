                <h1>Brief overview of the application and what it does</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="description cms">
				<p>Our application is designed to allow users to create, and join groups. Within Groups they can look at user information like: Name, Email, and Phone Numbers. This allows users to have their own study or social group information available to them from any android phone. This application could convince Middle School students that studying computing is cool because it will allow them to keep track of their groups too. With more and more kids using smart phones and no longer memorizing numbers, this app will allow them to easily keep track of their friends' numbers, or look up the numbers of their friends from a different phone. In this way if someone breaks their phone they don't have to lose their ability to call their friends.</p>

                <h1>Programming languages, compilers and IDEs used</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="description cms">
				<p>We used XML, Java, SQL, and PHP languages. NetBeans and Eclipse were the two IDEs we used and they also served as the compilers.</p>

				<p>No complex algorithms were used.</p>

                <h1>Sources of inspiration for the project</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="description cms">
				<p>We actually figured what we wanted to do pretty quickly.  Our idea stemmed from the fact that we have all needed to work with study groups and it is often very difficult to contact members. Just like we needed to contact each other to create this app. There are limited resources for sharing this information without exposing it to large communities like Facebook, which also contains a lot of personal information. This app would allow users to share contact information on a more discrete level. We originally wanted to create a visual database showing where other group members were, but decided that just having access to user information was also very valuable. Ultimately, there is more functionality that could be added in the future but as is this app is valuable as a study, social, and professional tool.</p>

                <h1>Libraries, frameworks and other tools used</h1>

			<div class="description cms">
				<p>We used Android, Java, MySQL, and PHP libraries.</p>

            <div class="title white">
                <h1>The process for making the application</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="description cms">
				<p>Creating the app started with each of us getting the Android SDK working on our computers. We then installed Saros, a code sharing extension. We then worked individually and together to create the database (SQL code) and the UI (XML / Java code) separately. Once we had both parts working we integrated the two of them. This of course caused bugs which we had to work to fix. We met and worked in the ICS computer lab to integrate all portions of the app and make sure that all of the app was functional. This took a lot of time and effort but was worth it as our app has turned out well.</p>

            <div class="title white">
                <h1>Major hurdles that had to be overcome</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="description cms">
				<p>The hurdles we faced while making this app included our busy schedule, lack of experience working with Android SDK, and creating our database. We used Saros code sharing, and Google Docs to overcome our time conflicts. We all read and watched Android development tutorials to learn how to create our User Interface. Finally, we received help from our advisor, Adam Brenner, who created a website and MySQL account for us.</p>

            <div class="title white">
                <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="description cms">
				<p>We learned a lot from creating this application. First, we learned how much work is involved to simply work in a group. Everyone has his or her own needs, schedule, and capabilities. We also learned how much can get done in such a short period of time. We were all wary of only having one week to create an application, especially once we realized none of us had ever made an application before. In the end, we all worked hard together and individually to produce something that we are all very proud of.</p>
