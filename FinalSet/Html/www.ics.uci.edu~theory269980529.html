Mutual Search<br>
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~josephw/">Joseph Wang</a>, ICS, UC

<p>We define a new type of search problem called "mutual search",
where <i>k</i> players arbitrarily spread over <i>n</i> nodes are
required to locate each other by send "Anybody at node I?" query
messages (for example processes in a computer network). If the
messages are not delivered in the order they were sent (for example
when the communica- tion delay time is arbitrary) then two players
require at least <i>n</i>&nbsp;-&nbsp;1 messages. In an
asynchronous network, where the messages are delivered in the order
they were sent, 0.88<i>n</i> messages suffice. In a synchronous
0.586<i>n</i> messages suffice and 0.536<i>n</i> messages are
required in the worst case. We exhibit a simple randomized
algorithm with expected worst-case cost of 0.5<i>n</i> messages,
and a deterministic algorithm for <i>k</i>&nbsp;<u>&gt;</u>&nbsp;2
players with a cost well below <i>n</i> for all <i>
k</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;o(sqrt&nbsp;<i>n</i>). The graph-theoretic
framework we formulated for expressing and analyzing algorithms for
this problem may be of independent interest.</p>
