            <p>The third breakout 
                    session attempted to address two basic issues, both related 
                    to the challenges and opportunities in future development 
                    of collaboratory technology. </p>
            <p>Questions raised to trigger discussion 
                    included:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>What kind of mismatches exist between 
                      the reality of collaboratory technologies, and the ideal 
                      representation of these technologies?<br>
              </li>
              <li>What are the areas in which collaboratory 
                      R&amp;D could make a difference? What advances are needed?<br>
              </li>
              <li>What would you recommend as deployable 
                      technologies to someone creating a collaboratory?<br>
              </li>
              <li>Is there consensus in our views?</li>
            </ul>
            <p><br>
                    The participants generated many recommendations for collaboratory 
                    designers. They are listed here, with the assumption that 
                    the advice will vary based on what kind of collaboratory is 
                    being built.</p>
            <ul>
              <li> Don't build until you know what 
                      is already out there.<br>
                 
                <ul>
                  <li>Some current technology does much 
                          of what is desired, document sharing, for example.<br>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li> Build for the web<br>
                 
                <ul>
                  <li>A nice feature is when any user 
                          can participate through a vanilla browser.<br>
                  </li>
                  <li>Making the access through the browser 
                          is nice, as the system can then be constantly updated.<br>
                  </li>
                  <li>There are benefits and risks to 
                          this, but consider providing at least minimal functionality 
                          via the web.<br>
                  </li>
                  <li>There can be many problems with 
                          standard software installs, and the web provides a &quot;work 
                          around&quot;<br>
                  </li>
                  <li>We can assume browsers and servers 
                          will still be around in 3-5 years.<br>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li> Do things you would do in any 
                      normal development project. <br>
                 
                <ul>
                  <li>Many of the issues that arise in 
                          collaboratory development are the same ones faced in 
                          any software development project. <br>
                  </li>
                  <li>Employing standard software development 
                          methodologies is a good starting point.<br>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li> Practice careful analysis of 
                      the needs of the users<br>
                 
                <ul>
                  <li>This should go without saying, but 
                          rarely happens.<br>
                  </li>
                  <li>Spend all the time needed to find 
                          out what the needs are<br>
                  </li>
                  <li>Consider rapid prototyping with 
                          many cycles and real users.<br>
                  </li>
                  <li>Make sure the development 
                          team has an understanding of the science that is being 
                          done.<br>
                     
                    <ul>
                      <li>The metaphor of the tools being 
                              developed needs to match with the metaphor of the 
                              work environment being supported.<br>
                      </li>
                      <li>Though one could argue that 
                              the development team only needs to make sure they 
                              understand the work process - not the intricacies 
                              of all the science that underpins it.<br>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li> Find someone to be your technology 
                      champion and identify and work with the opinion leaders<br>
                 
                <ul>
                  <li>Additionally, identify early adopters 
                          who will give feedback and be more forgiving.<br>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li> Make it compatible with what 
                      your user base is currently using<br>
                 
                <ul>
                  <li>Integrate into the user's environment, 
                          not the other way around. <br>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li> Start with something you know 
                      will work<br>
                 
                <ul>
                  <li>Make sure the initial technology 
                          will not scare your users off.<br>
                  </li>
                  <li>Then incrementally add services 
                          (possibly like plug-ins, on an as needed basis).<br>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li> Make sure there is a low cost of entry, 
                      it is easy to install, and you use standard platforms, so 
                      they don't have to purchase much.<br>
              </li>
              <li> Ease of use is very important, as this 
                      will probably not be their primary tool<br>
              </li>
              <li> Build in logging capabilities from 
                      the start.<br>
              </li>
              <li> Build in a parallel back channel, so 
                      there is an alternative to talking on the primary channel, 
                      either for repair if there is a break down, or for discussion 
                      or announcement of less important information.<br>
              </li>
              <li> Pay attention to standards, both real 
                      (w3c) and de facto (IE5.0)<br>
              </li>
              <li> If building, consider something that 
                      can go commercial, or be used by a consortium of universities.<br>
              </li>
              <li> When deciding to use - or not use - 
                      a tool, consider its extensibility<br>
              </li>
              <li> Keep in mind new technologies<br>
                 
                <ul>
                  <li>PDAs, etc.<br>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li> Go with Java<br>
                 
                <ul>
                  <li>Ease of development<br>
                  </li>
                  <li>Multi-platform<br>
                  </li>
                  <li>Will probably be a force in 3-5 
                          years, even with Microsoft's C# around.<br>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li> Go with Open Source<br>
              </li>
              <ul>
                <li>With the rise and fall of companies, 
                        one could think open-source initiatives might last longer 
                        than supported initiatives.<br>
                </li>
                <li>Organizational problems, as companies 
                        might not allow open development.<br>
                </li>
                <li>Support problems, as there is a tend 
                        to need good local support.<br>
                </li>
                <li>Promise and practice of contributions 
                        from the larger community is a big plus, especially for 
                        modular construction of collaborative apps.<br>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li> Plan for how you will support your 
                      users. Make sure there are resources devoted to this.<br>
              </li>
              <li> There was a suggestion to reduce 
                      platforms, to insure software will work on all the machines 
                      in use.<br>
                 
                <ul>
                  <li>Alternatively, tell users that they 
                          can use whatever platform they like, but that they have 
                          to install some universal plug in (like RealPlayer, 
                          or something like that).</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>&middot; Longer-term research issues:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> Distributed, collaboration-aware operating 
                      systems<br>
              </li>
              <li> Server vs. peer-to-peer services - 
                      how to design software that can do both, that can decide 
                      which it should use?<br>
              </li>
              <li> Can software intelligently make decisions 
                      about QoS? Can the collaboratory itself help decide what 
                      services to offer, and how to offer them?<br>
              </li>
              <li> Lots of login/authentication issues, 
                      as the security needs to be flexible enough to work with 
                      a variety of environments, working with a variety of authentication 
                      systems.<br>

              <li> As a collaboratory can be run on all

                      views of the data be effectively modified, as one steps 
                      down to hardware with fewer resources?<br>

                      collaborations - such as in fire fighting in huge forest 
                      fires, where people are distributed over a wide geographical 
                      space (from the individuals point of view), and they need 
                      to be coordinated, but also there can be simulations of 
                      the fire running (at NCAR or something) where there is a 
                      lot of computing power, but there can be fast data transfer 
                      to the people in the field.<br>

            <p>Participants also spoke of a need for a 
                    funding model that recognizes the need for building middleware. 
                    Middleware is one of those things that isn't necessarily commercially 
                    viable, and it isn't one particular person's problem. As a 
                    result there is a need for support of such efforts, from a 
                    funding perspective. The European Union is funding some projects 
                    that they expect to be &quot;commercially viable&quot;, but 
                    this doesn't necessarily mean that they will make lots of 
                    money - it could mean it is used widely by universities. There 
                    is also a reluctance to fund any thing that needs maintaining 
                    over a long time.</p>
            <p>The Glue - making the tools work together&#133;</p>
            <ul>
              <li> Main struggle of collaboratories is 
                      to put together a correct set of technologies, not developing 
                      the individual technologies. (Find video, whiteboard, remote 
                      instrument, chat, notebook that share a single security 
                      mechanism, logging/persistence mechanism, launching mechanism, 
                      etc.) <br>
              </li>
              <li> There aren't really any common glues<br>
              </li>
              <li> We need to make the glue to have the 
                      pieces work together.<br>
              </li>
              <li> Integration technologies<br>
                 
                <ul>
                  <li>Directory services, security models, 
                          XML<br>
                  </li>
                  <li>Using access grid<br>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li> Ex: in UARC - CBE as a kind of glue</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Observations</p>
            <ul>
              <li> The most interesting thing about a 
                      collaboratory is that the captured data might be mined and 
                      analyzed to discover &quot;new knowledge&quot;<br>
              </li>
              <li> Pretty cheap to save everything. Just 
                      save everything and work on creating tools to analyze that 
                      data. Conventions on note taking took a long time to develop<br>
              </li>
              <li> Unintended use - using a game for other 
                      interactive tasks<br>
              </li>
              <li> VOIP is problematic - lots of people 
                      are trying to do this - but they aren't very successful, 
                      lots of bandwidth/network problems, firewalls drop too many 
                      packets.<br>
              </li>
              <li> Granularity<br>
                 
                <ul>
                  <li>B1 - Granularity of understanding<br>
                     
                    <ul>
                      <li>Ex: should one approach UARC 
                              as a Java Applet or a frame work?<br>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Granularity of capture<br>
                     
                    <ul>
                      <li>Ex: Chat - how much do you log 
                              - when is too much logging taking place? Do you 
                              save enough to do sync-ed replay?<br>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li> Social Issues, such as with group authority, 
                      chain of command, policies - these are areas that can cause 
                      difficulty.<br>
              </li>
              <li> That there is a presumption that 
                      the systems are likely to break down.<br>
                 
                <ul>
                  <li>Schizophrenic attitude: we both 
                          expect it to work, and expect it to break.<br>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li> Someone is always awake - different 
                      work environment.<br>
                 
                <ul>
                  <li>Doing work in a collaboratory at 
                          night in North America, while there are people awake 
                          in Europe, is a fundamentally different space than working 
                          alone in a lab at night.<br>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li> Users don't usually ask explicitly 
                      for things such as &quot;context&quot; - these needs are 
                      interpreted from what is asked for.<br>
              </li>
              <li> Nestor noted a reluctance in many researchers 
                      to do work with collaboratories, but these same people do 
                      imagine they will be doing this stuff a few years from now. 
                      (They are reluctant to be early adopters.)<br>
              </li>
              <li> People want a collaboratory because 
                      it makes their collaboration visible. They are sometimes 
                      empire building, as, if you have a new tool, you have some 
                      advantage over your peers.<br>
              </li>
              <li> In business, there is a concern over 
                      the ROI for IT, but the lesson is that if they don't have 
                      the right IT, they are seen as not being &quot;with it,&quot; 
                      and are therefore less desirable. <br>
              </li>
              <li> New tools might be thought badly 
                      of if they don't have remote access built in.<br>
              </li>
