HI MOISHE!!!
I�M VERY VERY GLAD TO MEET YOU!
REALLY I DON�T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT MY FAMILY AND I�M VERY ANSIOUS TO KNOW SOMETHING.
I HOPE THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND MY ENGLISH, BECOUSE I DON�T PRACTICE NEVER, AND I 
FORGOT IT.

I LIVE RIGHTNOW IN PARAGUAY, FROM TWO MONTHS AGO.
BUT, I WAS BORN IN ARGENTINA, WHERE MY FATHER ARRIVES FROM POLONIA (GALICIA - I DON�T 
KNOW THE CITY) IN 1929.

HIS NAME WAS IOSEF LANGSAM, HE WAS BORN ON JULY 15, 1910 , SON OF IOSEF( MAY BE JAIME , 
I�M NOT SURE)  LANGSAM AND LAURA WILK HE LOST  CONTACT WITH HIS FAMILY WHEN HE LEAVE EUROPE. 
NOBODY OF HIS MAMILY CAMES WITH HIM. HE CAME ALONE.

I KNOW THAT HE HAS A COUSIN IN MONTEVIDEO, URUGUAY, BUT I DON�T HAVE THE NAME RIGHT NOW, I 
HAVE TO LOOK IT. I�M WAITING YOUR ANSWER AND THANKS FOR CONTACT ME.
WHERE ARE YOU LIVING?
BEST REGARDS

Hi,

Thank you for your reply. Your English is good. I live in Brooklyn, 
New York and have been looking into the family for some years now. 
I work in Manhattan, near Wall Street. 

I have a website at
www.langsam.com
or you can go to 
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/langsam/homelang.htm

I have many people in the tree from the family but I do not see a Iosif, 
son of Iosif Langsam. Perhaps if you can find the cousin and tell me about 
this person, we can find out more about your family. Do you know of any 
other Langsam? Do you have brothers or sisters? Children?

Where in Paraguay do you live? Please stay in contact.

IS YOSEF OR  JOSE IN SPANISH. ... AND LAURA WILK... OR WILCK ???  (THIS IS 
THE TRANSLATE TO THE SPANISH, I DON�T KNOW YOUR IDISH NAME)
> son of Iosif Langsam. Perhaps if you can find the cousin and tell me about 
> this person, I HAVE ONLY A PHOTO OF YOUR 10TH BIRTHDAY, AND SHE WROTE FOR 
MY COUSIN AND SIGN. I ARRIVE TO PARAGUAY TWO MONTHS AGO FROM SALTA, 
ARGENTINA  I MUST COME HERE BECAUSE ALL THE FAMILY OF MY HUSBAND IS HERE
AND  WE WAS ALONE IN SALTA. AND YOU KNOW (I THINK) THE ECONOMIC 
DIFFICULTIES THAT ARGENTINA CROSSES... AND I LOSE TEMPORALY THE PHOTO 
DURING THE CHANCE OF CITY.  DON�T WORRY I�LL FIND IT.
we can find out more about your family. Do you know of any 
other Langsam? Do you have brothers or sisters? Children?
I AM 50 AND I HAVE 1 GIRL, ROMINNA. (RONIT) SHE IS 14. MY HUSBAND DIED 6 
MONTH AGO. I HAVE A SISTER, ESTHER LANGSAM, SHE IS 59, AND LIVES IN MAR 
DEL PLATA, ARGENTINA.
MY FATHER DIED IN 1987 AND ALL HIS DOCUMENTS ARE IN BUENOS AIRES, HIS SECOND 
WIFE HAS IT. I�LL TRY TO GET IT (PHOTOS, PASSPORT, TICKET OF THE BOAT FROM 
EUROPE TO ARGENTINA)

> Where in Paraguay do you live? Please stay in contact.
I LIVE IN ASUNCI�N, AND I WISH TO STAY IN CONTACT. 
IN BUENOS AIRES, LIVE ANOTHER LANGSAM, JOS� AND HIS FAMILY. I KNOW 
THAT HE DIED. HE HAD SONS (I THINK 2) AND HAS A SHIRTS FACTORY. THAT�S 
ALL THAT I KNOW. 
THANKS

Does your sister have email? She is older, so perhaps she might 
remember more. Anyhow, your English is VERY good! Please let me 
know what you are able to find out.
Thanks!

TKS TO YOU!
MY SISTER HAS MAIL, BUT SHE DOESN�T SPEAK ENGLISH
I�LL TRY TO FIND ANOTHER DATES.
BUT ISN�T VERY EASY.
AND BY WILK??? NONE???
TO JOIN ALL MY FATHER�S DOCMENTS I THINK IT�S SPEND A MONTH
I�LL TRY TO CONTACT WITH MY SISTER TO ASK HER ABOUT THE CITY WHERE 
WAS BORN MY FATHER AND THE CORRECT NAMES OF OUR GRANDFATHERS. SHE 
ISN�T ON LINE, AND SHE OPEN HER MAIL ONCE AT WEEK. I�LL TRY. MY 
FATHER WAS A MAN WHO DON�T SPEAK A WORD OF YOUR LIFE AND YOUR FAMILY.
I THINK THAT HE FELT GUILTY BECAUSE: HE BELIEVED THAT YOUR FAMILY 
DIED WHILE HE CAMES TO AMERICA... HE MARRIED WITH A GOI  WOOMAN... I 
THINK THAT YOUR FATHER WAS A RABIN OR AN ORTODOX  MEMBER OF THE 
COMUNITY. 
THEN, HE PREFERED DON�T SPEAK  ABOUT IT.
I PROMISE YOU THAT I �LL FIND ALL THE INFORMATION ASAP

PD: WHAT ABOUT MANHATTAN AND WALL STREET NOW?

OH! TKS BY YOUR CONDELENCES. BUT... MAY  YOU EXPLAIN THIS FOR ME?
I THINK THAT I CAN UNDERSTAND BUT I�LL LIKE TO BE SURE:
> May your husband be a speaker in heaven on your behalf and all of Jewry.

I DON�T KNOW  WELL TWO WORDS: BEHALF (I THINK IS "MEDIUM"  MEANING... YES?)
AND JEWRY??? WHAT IS THIS???
TKS AND SEE YOU LATER

Behalf means "for someone". 
Example: If I do something for you, you can say that I do it 
on your BEHALF.
Jewry means the Jewish people.

TKS, IT WAS SUCH AS I THOUGHT (I DON�T REMENBER IF IS THIS 
THE PAST TENSE OF THINK)


I THINK THAT HE CAN DO IT. HE WASN�T A JEWISH,  BUT HE LOVED OUR 
PEOPLE. AND HE WANTS REALLY THAT I CAN GET INFORMATION ABOUT MY 
FAMILY... I BELIEVE THAT HE MADE THAT YOU WRITE ME AND I AM SURE 
THAT I�LL GO TO MEET THAT THAN I�M LOOKING FOR.
TKS MOISHE

I�M LOOKING FOR THE NAME OF MY FATHER�S COUSIN
