<h1>
Parameterized Complexity of 1-Planarity
</h1>
<h2>
Michael Bannister
</h2>

<p>
We consider the problem of finding a 1-planar drawing for a general
graph, where a 1-planar drawing is a drawing in which each edge
participates in at most one crossing. Since this problem is known to be
NP-hard we investigate the parameterized complexity of the problem with
respect to the vertex cover number, tree-depth, and cyclomatic
number. For these parameters we construct fixed-parameter tractable
algorithms. However, the problem remains NP-complete for graphs of
bounded bandwidth, pathwidth, or treewidth.
