				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Education in life continues for ever.  It is strange that you think that you have already seen a lot in life, have seen many events and had diverse experiences.  Life still surprises you and surprises you in different ways so you can not relate it easily to your earlier experiences.</p>
<p>I lead a very interesting life &#8212; and I love it, and even today I am loving it more than anything else I can imagine. </p>
<p>Since I consider myself an entrepreneur, researcher, and educator, I get many interesting experiences. Finally the educator in me said that I should start sharing some of my compelling experiences in simple form with people who care to come to this web site.  So I decided to start a series of blogs with titles &#8216;LifeLessons N:&#8217; where N will keep increasing and in each I will share what I consider important life lesson.  These will not be in any order of importance &#8212; they will be shared as they come to my mind based on what I am going through.  In most cases to protect privacy of other people, I will not give details of the situation, only discuss the lessons abstractly.  Only exception will be situations that only relate to me.</p>
<p>So LifeLesson 1: <em>If you suspect there is bad news coming, donâ€™t delay; get it as soon as you can.</em>.  </p>
<p>I am alive today because a doctor suspected that I may have Gastroesophageal cancer and he insisted that I go through endoscopy even with extremely remote possibility of it â€“ result was its detection even before it had touched any lymph node.  This early â€˜bad newsâ€™ (or diagnosis) saved my life.  Many specialists have told me that I am very lucky to be alive.  And every time I thank Dr. Major Reid for that.  Now for the last month, I was again having difficulty in eating so finally I gathered courage and went to a doctor and expressed my anxiety due to my history.  And today I had the test.<br />
Luckily, clean record this time.  But now at lesat I know that I may have many problems with my body, but relapse of Gastroesophageal cancer is not one of them.  So I am a relieved person.</p>
<p>My Lesson: If you suspect something bad is likely to happen, try to find the details as much as you can.  That may give you a chance to face it and take care of the situation.  Or it may tell you that you should stop worrying.  In either case, finding sooner is better.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am coming back after a long break &#8212; the longest since I started writing my blog.  First, I was quite busy and then I was traveling in China where things were hectic and access to Internet (due to travels, being with family, and some professional things) was not as good.  In any case, this has been a period of intense activities.</p>
<p>China trip was very interesting and illuminating.  There are good reasons why China is emerging so rapidly as a world leader.  It is always an experience to visit there &#8212; this time it was particularly more because I spend lot of time as a tourist.  I will start sharing some of my experiences on this topic as soon as I get back home &#8212; USA &#8212; in 2 days.</p>
<p>This was also the longest trip for me away from home.  I started missing home some time ago.  But remaining part of this year is going to be lots of travel &#8212; so I will not be much at home.  </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the passage of your life, you meet some people who make a lasting impression on you and you want them to be always part of your life.  Dave Lehman was one such individual.  A very creative and entrepreneurial individual, full of ideas and optimism, with a strong &#8216;can do&#8217; attitude.  He was a person who was equally at home at IBM or Kodak as well as at Praja.  Though I got a distinct feel that he liked start-up environment better than a big corporation.</p>
<p>He had a long bout with cancer.  Cancer of many kinds, ranging from simple skin to liver.  Finally in the company of all his family members he closed his eyes for the last time a few days ago at his residence in Florida.</p>
<p>I will miss yourr counsel, friendly telephone calls, and warm concerns about our family, Dave.  I am happy that you had a very rich and rewarding life.  But I will miss you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I had endoscopy of my Gastro-esophageal area (of stomach and esophagus).  Third time in about five years.</p>
<p>About 5 years ago, I underwent a similar inspection that revealed that I had cancer at the junction of my esophagus and stomach.  Exactly 3 days less than 5 years ago, my chemo started to cure the cancer.  After strong chemo and radiation, I had surgery to remove part of my stomach and part of esophagus.  </p>
<p>It was a really good news that after about 5 years, the cancer has no signs in that part of my body.  So I may have many other problems, but I don&#8217;t have cancer.  Good News.</p>
<p>At least four different senior doctors have told me that I am one of the luckiest person alive.  The mortality rate for the caner that I had is very high.  Moreover, who survive have too many complications in their system and do not live normal life.  In my case, it is not completely normal, but it is such that most people will not notice that I have any health problem because I do not have any serious side effects.  I am very thankful to the doctors who treated me and to enormous support of family and friends.  I owe a lot to many doctors, including Dr. Major Reid who suspected and pushed me to the tests that diagnosed the cancer in early stage, to Drs Brunson and Miller who treated me well and helped me recover.  Sudha and rest of my family here was simply amazing support through all the treatment.  And the support of all the friends, particularly Sirish Jani who helped me in treatment also, was overwhelming.  In fact I started writing blog just to inform my concerned friends about my health situation and that habit has continued even now.</p>
<p>I am so happy to be writing the blog about 5 years after I started.  I started with the news that I have the cancer and starting the treatment.  Now I am happy to share with my friends that I have crossed the important Five-Year cut-off point and I am without cancer.  </p>
<p>Once again, THANKS Folks for making life so interesting and enjoyable.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You meet several people in life.  You make several friends &#8212; but some of them become stronger friends over time, some remain just &#8216;friends&#8217; and some phase-out.  In fact, time is the best test of friendship, particularly difficult times.  </p>
<p>Yesterday, we attended 25th wedding anniversary of a couple, Ajay and Juhi Luthra.  We met them about 12-13 years ago and since then our friendship has been slowly and steadily strengtheing.  Since this was a special occassion, I started thinking about them.  I realized how great both of them are as human beings.  They have always been there during difficult times, particularly Juhi for Sudha.  And we did go through interesting times, including multiple weddings on one side to several health crises in my life as well as other person &#8216;interesting&#8217; periods.  And it Juhi was always there helping Sudha.  Of course, Ajay is one of the nicest guys and the brightest.  </p>
<p>I am lucky to have friends like them.  Here is a photo showing the 25th wedding anniversery for them.</p>
