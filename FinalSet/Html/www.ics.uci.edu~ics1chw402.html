<h2>International trade in Russia</h2>
<A HREF="http://www.crop.cri.nz/landcare/intl.html">International business</A> is truly a great 
potential business in our 
modern world. The total volume of world trade today is around $7 trillion each year. Regardless of a
country's resources, no country can produce all of the goods and services demanded by
its citizens. For people of Russia, they have to stand in long lines for necessary daily
products because the country's lack of resources. Thus, the Russian state's economic
policies try to integrate the country into a prosperous economy by
opening its doors to foriegn trade activities.<A 
HREF="http://www.globeandmail.ca/tuneup08.html">Foreign investments</A> are 
considered to be the
main source of money to restructure the former socialist economy. Doing
international business is extrememly risky, a company should understand the legal
aspects in foreign investment, which kind of managerial style is best for the company
and what are the government regulations being imposed upon the business. These are
the questions we need to consider when attempting to extend businesses abroad.<BR>
<P>
<STRONG>Business Management</STRONG><BR>
The success of any firm depends largely on how well that firm is managed. And to 
<A HREF="http://www.miis.edu/im_mba.html">manage</A> a firm well, managers must 
plan, organize, lead and control. What makes
international business so challenging is the fact that these basic responsibilities are
much more difficult to accomplish in an international context. It is best to find
licensed broker to operate in Russian market. <A 
HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/jdg/www/invest_brokers.html">
Brokers</A> are licensed and governed by
the Ministry of Finace of Russia;therefore, they can guide companies through any
confusions and problems. The brokers offer safe-keeping services to their clients. The
brokers offer a nominee ownership registration and settlement of transactions on
behalf of a client; however, there are difficulties in the maintenance of monetary
accounts with brokers. According to the Russian legislation only banks have an
official right to keep monetary accounts and organize monetary settlement for all
types of transactions (Rinaco, 1994). Companies can choose between two ways of
carrying out their investment activities in Russia. They can either establish a
registered permanent representative office or a branch in Russia, or work without
such an office or branch. The second option is that operations in Russia are done
either through the intermediary organization or through the authorized person.<BR>
<P>
But first a firm must decide how much involvement they want their business 
in the country. Because different levels of involvement in international 
business require different kinds of organizational structure. <BR>

The most recommended one is strategic alliances and franchising and sometimes it is
called <EM>joint ventures</EM>. An international strategic alliance is a foreign 
company that
finds a partner in the country who would like to begin a business together. Instead of
just licensing this partner, each party to the alliance agrees to put an approximately
equal amount of resources and capital into a new business. The parent company
supplies the business expertise, business knowledge, and brand name. Local investors
supply the capital, local contacts, and understanding of the local market.<BR> 
<P>
<STRONG>Government Regulation</STRONG><BR>
Government regulates business for variety of reasons, the two most important of
which are to protect competition and to meet the nation's social goals. According to
Russian's foreign person, legal or natural, has the right to invest in Russian
enterprises, to buy or to sell Russian securities and repatriate profit from Russia after
payment of appropriate taxes. Nevertheless, legislation governing foreign investment
is undeveloped and exists in a very primitive and basic form (Rinaco, 1994). There is
a tendency for a large number of violations and infringements to occur when the
governemnt try to carry out the <A HREF="http://www.spb.su/rulesreg/govern.html">liberalization of 
foreign economic activities</A>. 
There might be practices of illegal competition, and failure to return the specified earning
into the country from export operations. It is easy to acknowledge that establish
capitalism in Russia is not easy. Indeed, the list of potential problems are staggering.
They lack all or most of the following:<BR> 
<UL>
<LI>Laws that protect private property and guide the establishemnt of contracts. 
<LI>Standardized <A HREF="http://anet.scu.edu.au/ANetHomePage.html">accounting</A> 
procedures <LI><A HREF="http://www.worldbank.org/">Banks</A> 
<LI><A HREF="http://www.emi.net/financial_market.html">Stock and bond markets</A> 
<LI><A HREF="http://www.fe.msk.ru/infomarket/rtsb/ewelcome.html">Convertible 
currency</A>(currency that can be exchanged for the currencies of
   other countries) 
</UL>
Moreover, continued <A HREF="http://www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/127.html">political 
and economic turmoil in Russia</A> has led to a pattern in
which many internal laws, <A HREF="http://www.spb.su/rulesreg/export.html">tariff regulations</A>, and 
<A HREF="http://www.spb.su/rulesreg/decree1.html">restrictions on foreign trade</A> are here today and 
gone tomorrow (Ebert, 1994).<BR> <P>
<STRONG>Strategies for Success</STRONG><BR>
Success in exporting doesn't come overnight. But following a few simple steps can
certainly help to increase a firm's chances. Experts suggest the following plan for
businesses that want to start exporting (Griffin, 1994).<BR> 
<P>
1.<EM>Establish export potential</EM>. To <A HREF="http://www.spb.su/rulesreg/decree1.html">export</A> 
successfully, firms need to know how well
their products will stack up against competitors. The <A 
HREF="http://www.doc.gov/CommerceHomePage.html">U.S. 
Commerce Department</A> helps companies obtain this information through its Export Qualifier Program. The
program provides a computer analysis of a company's organizational and product
strengths and compares those factors to characteristics associated with successful
exporters.<BR>
<P>
2.<EM>Develop a marketing plan</EM>. Once export potential is established, exporters 
must
develop a <A HREF="http://www.trinet.com/allen.html">marketing</A> plan. Research 
about culture, customs, language, and currency is essential.<BR>
<P>
3.<EM>Arrange financing</EM>. International business investments usually requires a 
large
start-up cost. Arranging for <A 
HREF="http://apollo.co.uk/a/International_Funding/">loans</A> 
to finance foreign ventures was a major stumbling
block for many new companies. Many state agencies can help businesses obtain loans
to <A HREF="http://gnn.com/gnn/meta/finance/index.html">finance</A> international 
business activities.<BR> <P>
4.<EM>Assemble a distribution system</EM>. Shipping and distrubuting to foreign 
markets can be
complicated. Some companies work successfully with distributors and agents in
foreign countries. Another option is using an international export management
company or freight forwarding company that will handle all the paperwork and keep
its customers advised.<BR>
<P>
5.<EM>Protect Revenues</EM>. Transferring money internationally involves letters of 
credit and
bank drafts. To minimize risk on the international front, firms should avoid selling in
countries experiencing political or social upheaval.<BR>
<P>
<STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG><BR>
The subject of International Business has been affected by the World Wide Web in a
positive way. Information are exchanged between countries and this is an effecient
way for them to retrieve sources from variety of places. World Wide Web provides
an overview about the international market for people who are interested in foreign
investment. Also it can act as a guide to students because business activity in a country
is a good indicator of its economy.<BR>
