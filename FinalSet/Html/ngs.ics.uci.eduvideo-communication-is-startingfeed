		<description><![CDATA[I still find this incredible that this technology exists and is now a part of mainstream society. When I was a child I used to watch science fiction movies and programs in awe, where a person would communicate with another through &#039;picture phone,&#039; which was usually some sort of a big block on the users desk.
