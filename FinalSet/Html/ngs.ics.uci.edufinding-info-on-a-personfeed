There might be a risk of flooding the mail inbox with flurry of spam mails. But keeping the negative effects on one side; isnâ€™t it great to find someone after such a long time which you rather wouldnâ€™t expect?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Mr. Jain:

I would like to google a person but do not know how to go about it. Could you forward me to a web site that would give me instructions on how to google a person.

I would appreciate any help you could give me.

Sincerely yours,
