<strong>Friday February 22 &#8211; Sunday February 24</strong></p>
<p><strong>Location: Borrego Springs, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anza-Borrego_Desert" title="Anza-Borrego Desert" target="_blank">Anza-Borrego Desert</a>, exact location TBA</strong></p>
<p>Doctoral students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty from across California are invited to the inaugural Southern California Winter STS retreat. This retreat is being organized under the auspices of the UC Irvine STS Initiative, funded by the Office of Research, and the EVoKE Lab at UC Irvine.</p>
<p>This retreat is designed for a select group of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty advance their research projects in the field of STS, broadly defined, and in so doing to advance an emergent set of problematics and topical foci in STS itself. The emphasis will be on intellectual play. It is not intended to be a training workshop, and graduate students will be expected to participate in the same manner as other participants. Collectively, we will explore each others’ topics through a series of focused discussions as well as small-group engagements with the Anza-Borrego environment. It is <span style="text-decoration: underline">not</span> expected that participants necessarily be interested in the study of desert ecosystems, etc.; we will use the local context to stimulate new ways of thinking that we can apply to our own research projects.</p>
<p>STS is to be taken here as an umbrella rather than a fence: work in cognate disciplines (informatics, anthropology, design, etc.) that deploys and engages with STS work is considered part of the mix. We will bring together up to 30 graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty for this three-day retreat. There will be two foci: (1) identifying and exploring common interests through two “spotlight” sessions; and (2) exploring these themes through teams exploring the local area. Accommodation for all will be covered; travel will be covered in exceptional circumstances for students. A registration fee of $100 is required. Since space is limited, there will be a selection process: please send a CV and a one-page statement of interest <a href="mailto:steveslota@gmail.com">to steveslota@gmail.com </a>by<span style="text-decoration: underline"> December 15, 2012</span>. The statement of interest should briefly address the research in progress that you would like to further through participation in the workshop. Those selected to participate in the workshop will be notified by January 1. They will be expected to circulate a two-page description of a current or prospective project by February 1.</p>

<p><strong>The death of the drum. Unique things on the Rai Coast of Papua New Guinea.</strong></p>
<p><em>James Leach. University of Aberdeen.</em></p>
<p>Slit-gong drums, made and used as part of affinal exchange relations on the Rai Coast of Papua New Guinea, are said to have a ’voice’ and thus carry gravitas; they demand respect as a kind of person. Further, they are so closely tied to the person and position of their owners that they are said to be <em>their </em>voice. These slit-gongs cannot be extracted from the kin formations in which they came into being, and in which they have their on-going effect. However, in 2010, in an unprecedented event, a large slit-gong made for and used by a local Community School was attacked during a dispute. I examine the notion of irreplaceability framed against the notion of generic objects, and allude to the different political economies in which each rendition of things makes sense. The paper explores what the attack implies about the changing status of slit-gongs, and of on-going transformations in how things and persons are linked on the Rai Coast. I conclude with the proposition that Rai Coast slit-gongs are specific and unique things because of the ‘relational’ position they sustain. In this they have a temporal rather than essential uniqueness.</p>

<p><strong>Mapping Dark Matter, The Venetian Paradox, and Performative Cartography: Pursuing The Liminal Boundary Between the Mappable and the Unmappable</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>            </em></strong><em>David Turnbull, University of Melbourne</em><em> </em></p>
<p>The question of where and how the boundary between the mappable and the unmappable moves is brought on by the recent announcement of  ‘The Map of Dark Matter’ and its parallels with the ‘Venetian Paradox’. The dark matter map, in bringing into visibility and knowability that which was previously by definition invisible, seems to have forced a reconfiguration of thought and knowledge very like that brought about in Venice with the publication of Luca Paciolo’s  mathematical encyclopedia Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalità, in 1494. This famous work was the first to give formal protocols to double entry bookkeeping and linear perspective, both of which are dependent on the previously unthinkable, contradictory, and paradoxical– zero, that which was both something and nothing. These reconfigurations occurred in Venice, a site which itself is at the liminal boundary, being miraculously self-constructed on the land and in the water, mapping itself into existence out of nothing. The paper explores the ways in which performative cartography can illuminate these early shapings of the forms of knowledge, objectivity, value and place that came to underpin capitalism, science and modernity, and the transformations brought about by ‘cosmopaleontology’, the map of dark matter, and the current problems besetting the Venetian lagoon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Take part in an intensive one-week workshop on values in the design of information systems and technology. Doctoral students at any stage from a variety of disciplines are invited to attend, including – but not restricted to – informatics, computer science, science studies, design, visual arts, and social entrepreneurship. Travel, food, and lodging will be covered, though accepted participants are encouraged to seek support from their home institutions.</p>
<p>The workshop will be restricted to twenty (20) students. Mornings will be devoted to discussing a judicious mix of readings and exercises from the fields above, led by Geoffrey C. Bowker, Judith Gregory, and Cory Knobel. In the afternoons, students will work in interdisciplinary groups to produce a project plan incorporating strong social values into information systems and technology, with guest lectures from thought leaders such as Paul Dourish, Helen Nissenbaum, and Carl DiSalvo throughout the week. The workshop will close with project presentations to a panel of academics and entrepreneurs. We will offer support and rewards for projects that continue on to working prototypes and project launch.</p>
<p>Send applications by March 30, 2012 to vid@ics.uci.edu, including a CV, one letter of recommendation, and a two-page description of your interest. Decisions will be made by April 15, 2012.</p>
