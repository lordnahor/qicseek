<BODY><H2> Speeding up mobile code execution on <br> resource-constrained embedded processors.
</H2> 
</font>

<p>
Embedded platforms are increasingly connected to the Web and are executing mobile code.<br>
These platforms are a resource-constrained environment in which interpreted execution<br>
of mobile codes is the norm and highly-optimized or dynamic compilation systems are not<br>
a suitable choice, primarily due to their high memory requirements.<br>
At the same time, the performance of the executed code is of critical importance and<br>
is often the limiting factor in both the capabilities of the system and user perception.<br>
</p>
<p>
The goals of this research project were to significantly improve interpreter performance<br>
for mobile code on embedded platforms without increasing its resource requirements and to<br>
design a resource constrained basic block dynamic compilation system to be used with an<br>
interpreter for adaptive optimization at "low cost".<br>
</p>
<p>
The framework proposed to achieve for both of these goals is based on "superoperators" and<br>
code "annotations".  The former are groups of instructions that can be executed as a unit and<br>
optimized together.  The latter is a mechanism for passing information from a compiler producing<br>
mobile code to the interpreter running on a client system.   The proposed approach shifts<br>
as much of the work of identifying, compiling, and optimizing  superoperators as possible to<br>
the compiler and thus both simplifies and speeds up interpreted execution.  This is possible<br>
because the annotations can carry the additional information (otherwise unavailable in the<br>
mobile code) between the compiler and the interpreter.   Annotations can also reduce delays<br>
and allow small applets to be optimized with little or no overhead when used with adaptive<br>
dynamic optimization.  Currently such optimization requires dynamic profiling and incurs<br>
the associated overhead.<br>
</p>
<p>
Superoperators provide two main advantages for optimizing interpreter performance.  They reduce<br>
the dispatch overhead of individual bytecodes comprising the superoperator and they allow<br>
stack-based communication to be converted to a more efficient form using registers.  The<br>
registers can be utilized without dynamic compilation if the superoperators are created statically.<br>
Alternatively, they can be introduced by a simplified dynamic compilation module which is invoked<br>
when specified by an annotation.<br>
</p>
<p>
The resulting combination of some of the main benefits of JIT compilation, superoperators (SO's)<br>
and profile-guided optimization delivers a lightweight Java bytecode compilation system for<br>
resource-constrained environments that achieves runtime performance similar to that of <br>
state-of-the-art JIT/Adaptive Optimization systems, while having a minimal impact on <br>
runtime memory consumption.<br>
<br>
For experimental evaluation, we developed three Virtual Machines (VMs). One deploys <br>
our proposed techniques. This VM is first compared (w.r.t. runtime performance) <br>
to a baseline interpreted VM and then to a VM that employs state-of-the-art JIT/AO. <br>
Our system attains speedups ranging from a factor of 1.52 to a factor of 3.07, w.r.t. to the<br>
baseline VM. When compared to a state-of-the-art JIT/AO VM,<br>
our system achieves performance which is within a factor of two w.r.t JIT/AO.<br>
It is actually better for three of the benchmarks and worse by less than a factor<br>
of 2 for three others. But our SO-extended VM outperforms the JIT/AO system by a factor of<br>
16, on average, w.r.t. runtime memory consumption.<br>
