The brain is a blooming, buzzing bag of electromagnetic and biochemical 
signals based on an alien technology.  Despite great advances in 
neuroscience, which have allowed us to identify its molecular parts list, 
the operation of the brain as a system remains mysterious.  
I will show how recent advances in signal processing applied to 
brain recordings are beginning to pull aside the curtain.
