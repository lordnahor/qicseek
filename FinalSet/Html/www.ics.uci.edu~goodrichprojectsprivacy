<p>
The aim of this proposal is to develop efficient algorithms for 
cyber-security and privacy based on paradigms that enable 
efficient trusted computing in distributed environments.
Specifically,
this proposal is directed at developing and applying 
efficient algorithmic
techniques to the problems of
privacy management, measurement, and visualization.
Deliverables of this project include
distributed algorithms supporting cyber-security and privacy goals
that have low latency and storage
requirements, small communication costs, and fast, real-time
interaction.
