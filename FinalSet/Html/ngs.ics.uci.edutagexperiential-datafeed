				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This emerging form of the story is more data-driven.  It will use meta data as well as data intentionally and consciously captured by a person who may be collecting this for personal use, but then may decide to share the experience of the event with others.  Obviously, every story is to share your experiences.  That means that the storyteller customizes the experiences to be included in the story based on his/her knowledge of the interests of recipients of the story.</p>
<p>Even micro-stories should consider the experiences that the storyteller wants to include in the story targeted to specific audience.  Most of these stories are being told using mobile phones.  This is good, because mobile phones are much better experience and even capture devices than any that existed so far.  They collect much information, sometimes too much, for micro-storytelling.  There are already some applications that are going in this direction. Path and Tiny Reviews are two of my current favorites.  One may even consider Instagram to be one such application.</p>
<p>So far, video has not being used much in such micro stories.  Video will become popular sometimes in very near future.  Even audio, not only speech but also audio of the environments in which events take place, is not currently used much.  This is also likely to become popular.</p>
<p>Effectively, the current trend suggests that we are using &#8216;low hanging fruits&#8217; in experiential data.  Once we have used these, micro stories will migrate to using more experiential data.</p>
