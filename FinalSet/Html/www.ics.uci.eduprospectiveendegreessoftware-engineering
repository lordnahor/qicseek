<P>
The Software Engineering major prepares students to be productive members of software engineering teams in a 
variety of application domains, with focus on the domains of major importance within each decade. It combines a 
solid foundation in computer science with knowledge of how to engineer modern software systems, and how to function 
within teams. 
<P>
Coursework in mathematics and statistics provide students the basis for rigorous thinking; coursework in the 
foundations of computer science provide students the basis for computational thinking; coursework in topics of 
software engineering prepares students for the production of software; project courses prepare students for the 
practice of software development.  The major emphasizes the design and implementation of large software systems.

A wide variety of careers and graduate programs are open to Software Engineering graduates. The Web and mobile applications industry is a multi-billion dollar industry, and job growth projections are the strongest for people with strong technical backgrounds. Many other application domains, including interactive entertainment, medical information systems, and training and education software have demand for similar skill sets and knowledge. Graduate school in either computer science or software engineering or a related IT field is also a possible career path.

UC Irvine offers several ways to add depth scope, and experiential learning to your academic program of study. An academic counselor will help you determine the most efficient way to add another major, a minor or concentration to your academic plan, and will refer you to other campus programs and resources that support your interests and future goals. All Bren School majors in good standing may propose an academic plan that demonstrates the ability to complete the concentration and other requirements for graduation in a reasonable timeframe.

<UL class="content-list-large">
   
   <LI><STRONG>CONCENTRATION: Engineering and Computer Science in the Global Context. </STRONG>
       The globalization of the marketplace for information technology services and products makes it likely that Bren School graduates will work in multicultural settings or be employed by companies with extensive international operations or customer bases. The goal of the concentration is to help students develop and integrate knowledge of the history, language and culture of a country or geographic region outside the United States, through coursework both at UCI and an international host campus, followed by a technology related internship in the host country. 
       <P CLASS="sub-indent">
          <P><STRONG>Application:</STRONG><BR>
             Each student’s proposed program of study, specifying coursework and a guided internship experience in a region outside the U.S. must be approved in advance by the Bren School’s Associate Dean for Student Affairs. It is expected that each student’s proposal will reflect a high degree of planning that includes the guidance of academic counselors and those at the UCI Center for International Education regarding course selection, as well as considerations related to internship opportunities, housing and financial aid. The academic counselors and the Associate Dean will be available to assist qualified students with the development of a satisfactory academic plan, as needed.
      <P><STRONG>Requirements:</STRONG> <BR>
             <UL CLASS="sub-indent">
             <LI>A minimum of eight courses at UCI or at the international campus with an emphasis on the culture, language (if applicable and necessary), history, literature of the country that corresponds to the international portion of the program, international law, international labor policy, global issues, global institutions, global conflict and negotiation, and global economics;  </LI>
             <LI>A one- or two-semester sequence of technical courses related to the major and, possibly, cultural, history and literature courses taken at an international university; </LI>
             <LI>A two-month or longer technical internship experience in the same country as the international educational experience. </LI>
              </UL>

   <LI><STRONG>Bren School Honors Program.</STRONG>       Allows juniors and seniors enrolled in Bren School major (Biomedical Computing, Business Information Management, 
      Computer Game Science, Computer Science, Computer Science and Engineering, Informatics, Information and Computer 
      Science, or Software Engineering) to pursue advanced work in one of many research areas. Students who join the 
      program participate in an honors seminar, conduct independent research under the guidance of a faculty member, 
      and write a research paper.

                               According to IEEE publication <I>Today's Engineer</I>, software engineering is a hot industry, "with more demand
                               for talented professionals than ever." In fact, the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics 
                               predicts a 30 percent growth rate for software engineering jobs through 2020 — much higher than the 14 
                               percent average growth rate for all other occupations.
