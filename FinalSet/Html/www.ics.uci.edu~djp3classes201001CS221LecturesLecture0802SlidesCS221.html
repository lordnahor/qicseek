    <meta name="description" content="Querying Introduction to Information Retrieval CS 221 Donald J. Patterson Content adapted from Hinrich Schütze http://www.informationretrieval.org  Boolean Retrieval Weighted Boolean Retrieval Zone Indices Term Frequency Metrics The full vector space model Overview Querying  From the bottom “Grep” Querying without an index or a crawl Whenever you want to find something you look through the entire document for it. Example: You have the collected works of Shakespeare on disk You want to know which play contains the words “Brutus AND Caesar” Querying  “Grep” “Brutus AND Caesar” is the query. This is a boolean query. Why? What other operators could be used? The grep solution: Read all the files and all the text and output the intersection of the files Querying  “Grep” Slow for large corpora Calculating “NOT” requires exhaustive scanning Some operations not feasible Query: “Romans NEAR Countrymen” Doesn’t support ranked retrieval Moving beyond grep is the motivation for the inverted index. Querying  Querying Our inverted index is a 2-D array or Matrix A Row for Each Word (or “Term”) A Column For Each Document  Boolean Query Queries are boolean expressions Search returns all documents which satisfy the expression Does Google use the Boolean model? Querying  Boolean Query Straightforward application of inverted index where cells of inverted index are (0,1) indicating presence or absence of a term Querying Term Document  Boolean Query 0/1 vector for each term “Brutus AND Caesar AND NOT Calpurnia =  Perform bitwise Boolean operation on each row: 110100 AND 110111 AND !(010000) = 100100 Querying Term Document  Boolean Query A big corpus means a sparse matrix A sparse matrix motivates the introduction of the posting Much less space to store Only recording the “1” positions Querying  Boolean Query Query processing on postings Brutus AND Caesar Locate the postings for Brutus Locate the postings for Caesar Merge the postings Querying  Boolean Query Merging -&gt; walk through the two posting simultaneously postings sorted by doc ID Querying  Boolean Query An algorithm based on postings Linear in the size of the postings Querying  Boolean Query Is the algorithmic complexity better than scanning? Where would you put more complex formulae? Querying  Boolean Queries Exact match Views each document as a “bag of words” Precise: a document matches or it doesn’t Primary commercial retrieval tool for 3 decades Professional searchers (e.g., lawyers) still like Boolean queries No question about what you are getting Querying  Linear on-demand retrieval (aka grep) 0/1 Vector-Based Boolean Queries Posting-Based Boolean Queries Building up our query technology Querying  Linear on-demand retrieval (aka grep) 0/1 Vector-Based Boolean Queries Posting-Based Boolean Queries  How would it apply to  http://www.rhymezone.com/shakespeare/ Building up our query technology Querying  Boolean Model vs. Ranked Retrieval Methods Querying * Appeared with www * uses “free-text” queries * system decides relevance * works with enormous corpora * “no guarantees” in queries       * Only game for 30 years * uses precise queries * user decides relevance * stayed current with proximity queries * precise controlled queries * transparent queries * controlled queries         Westlaw Largest commercial (paying subscribers) legal search service (started in 1975, ranking added in 1992) Tens of terabytes of data 700,000 users Majority of users still use boolean queries (default in 2005) Example: What is the status of limitations in cases involving federal tort claims act? LIMIT! /3 STATUTE ACTION /S FEDERAL /2 TORT /3 CLAIM /3 = within 3 words.  /S same sentence Querying - Boolean Search Example  Westlaw Example: Requirements for disabled people to be able to access a workplace disabl! /p access! /s work-site work-place employment /3 place space is a disjunction not a conjunction long precise queries, proximity operators, incrementally developed, not like web search preferred by professionals, but not necessarily better Querying - Boolean Search Example  “Matching” search Linear on-demand retrieval (aka grep) 0/1 Vector-Based Boolean Queries Posting-Based Boolean Queries Ranked search Parametric Search Building up our query technology Querying  Rather than saying  (query, document) matches or not (0,1) (“Capulet”,”Romeo and Juliet) = 1 Now we are going to assign rankings (query, document) in {0,1} (“capulet”,”Romeo and Juliet”) = 0.7 Ranked Search Querying  Metadata = structured additional information about a document. Examples: The author of a document The creation date of a document The title of a document The location where a document was created author, creation date, title, location are fields searching for “William Shakespeare” in a doc differs from searching for “William Shakespeare” in the author of a doc Querying  Parametric Search supports searching on meta-data explicitly a parametric search interface allows a mix of full-text query and meta-data queries Example: www.carfinder.com Querying  Parametric Search Example: Result is a large table Columns are fields Searching for “2005” only applied to year field www.carfinder.com Querying  Parametric Search Example:  http://www.ocregister.com/realestate/ Querying  Parametric Search Example:  http://www.ocregister.com/realestate/ 92614: 77 results Querying  Parametric Search Example:  http://www.ocregister.com/realestate/ 92614: 77 results Querying  In these examples we select field values Values could be hierarchical USA -&gt; California -&gt; Orange County -&gt; Newport Beach It is a paradigm for navigating through a corpus e.g, “Aerospace companies in Brazil” can be found by combining “Geography” and “Industry” Approach: Filter for relevant documents Run text searches on subset Parametric Search  Index support for parametric search Must be able to support queries of the form: Find pdf documents that contain “UCI” Field selection and text query Field selection approach Use inverted index of field values (field value, docID) organized by field name Using same compression and sorting techniques Parametric Search  “Matching” search Linear on-demand retrieval (aka grep) 0/1 Vector-Based Boolean Queries Posting-Based Boolean Queries Ranked search Parametric Search Zones Building up our query technology Querying  A zone is an extension of a field A zone is an identified region of a document e.g., title, abstract, bibliography Generally identified by mark-up in a document &lt;title&gt;Romeo and Juliet&lt;/title&gt; Contents of zone are free text Not a finite vocabulary Indices required for each zone to enable queries like: (instant in TITLE) AND (oatmeal in BODY) Doesn’t cover “all papers whose authors cite themselves” Why? Zones  Now, we crawl the corpus We parse the document keeping track of terms, fields and docIDs Instead of building just a (term, docID) pair We build (term, field, docID) triples These can then be combined into postings like this: Parametric Search  So are we just creating a database? Not really. Databases have more functionality Transactions Recovery  Our index can be recreated. Not so with database. Text is never stored outside of indices We are focusing on optimized indices for text-oriented queries not a full SQL engine Parametric Search"/>
