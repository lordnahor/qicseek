		<description><![CDATA[Ian,
On Tineye all he images are the same with different resolution and possibly compression so it is quite possible that there is either some metadata or a simple matching of histograms (or dct coefficients) that are being used.  On google, they are using the keywords and many times the same keyword goes with different images.

In any case, this is an interesting approach.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m pretty sure it is doing something content-based, though of course I can&#039;t be sure.  For instance, a search based on an image of Michelangelo&#039;s PietÃ  turns up these results:

http://tineye.com/search/141e3500ffcbe31f483a02644c8c2ae83cd139f5

None of them are exactly the original, but the amount of visual variation among the images is much less than you&#039;d get from Google:

http://images.google.com/images?q=michelangelo+piet%E0

This suggests that it really is using the image content.]]></description>
