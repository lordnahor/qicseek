  <p>Part A: </p>
  <div class="indentRight">
    <ol>
      <li>Pick an example out of your design notebook (discussed first day of class)</li>
      <li>Include a picture or sketch of the design example</li>
      <li> Pick 3 principles from the text (8 golden rules) that are applicable to your example.</li>
      <li>Also pick 3 guidelines from some set of guidelines in the text, or from Apple that are applicable to your example.
        <ol>
          <li>Guidelines don't necessarily have to be instantiations of the principles above. </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li> For each guideline and each principle
        <ol>
          <li>Explain how it applies to the example.</li>
          <li>What it reveals (positive or negative) about the design.</li>
          <li>Suggest an improvement (if analysis was negative)</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Provide a summary judgment of the example (positive or negative)</li>

  <p>Part B: </p>
  <div class="indentRight">
    <ol>
      <li>Pick a web site that you use frequently but doesn't allow you to do what you want to do well. Provide 1 screen snapshot.</li>
      <li>Analyze it as above (Explain, what, suggest...) using these heuristics:
        <ol>
          <li><a href="http://www.useit.com/papers/heuristic/heuristic_list.html">http://www.useit.com/papers/heuristic/heuristic_list.html</a></li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Your analysis should address who the intended users of the site are, what the users want to achieve by using the site.
        <ol>
          <li>Decide if you are in the target audience.</li>
          <li>Describe how the site is failing it's users and/or you, including, if applicable, characteristics of the users and their backgrounds that the site designers didn't understand or accommodate well.</li>
          <li>Suggest improvements and justify them.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Your analysis should focus on usability issues rather than pure functionality; while the line is sometimes hard to draw (adding a search feature, for example, is increased functionality that also affects the usability of a site), don't try to solve the problems by making the system into something that it wasn't intended to be</li>
