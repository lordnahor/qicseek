<h2><A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics54/">ICS 54 Winter 2000</A>:  
Homework 5
</h2>

<p> 
<dl> 
<dt>This assignment is to be done individually. 
<dt>All work for it should be done in a special directory (on a UCI UNIX system,
either ICS or OAC-EA) which you set aside for the purpose which
contains no other work and which you keep for future reference and use
in this course.  
<dd>Suggestion: Have a <tt>ics54</tt> directory and
put the work for this assignment in an <tt>ics54/hw5</tt>
subdirectory.  
<dt>This assignment is due at <b>the start of class,
Monday, March 6</b>.  
<dd>You will turn in a printout with a
separate cover/title page containing:  
<br> (1) 
Your Personal Identification (Name, Student ID number, and UCInetID), 
<br> (2)
Assignment Identification (course name and quarter plus assignment
number).  
<dt>Please print separate parts of the assignment on separate
sheets and label the pages appropriately.  
</dl> 
<p>

<p> The TA will be available in CS 364 at the following times:  
<ul>
<li>Thursday & Friday, February 24 & 25: 11 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.
<li>Thursday & Friday, March 2 & 3: 10 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.  
</ul> 
The Instructor will also be available in his office (Engineering Gateway
2149) during the following hours as well as at other times by
arrangement:
<ul> 
<li>Wednesday & Monday, February 23, 28: 4:30-5:30 p.m.;
Wednesday, March 1: 5-6 p.m.
</ul>

<hr> 
<ol> 

<li>You have grade reports from Math101, Biology121, and
Philosophy102. Each file contains columns specifically for student's
name, ID and final grade (grade ranges from 0.0 to 4.0). Suppose that
each file has exactly the same students, although not necessarily in the
same order.

<p>Create a shell script, <tt>GradeReport</tt>, which combines the
information from these three reports into a single one which has 5
columns: student ID, name, and grades from each of the three
courses. The report should be sorted according to student ID.

<p>You need not check that the files have the same names for the same
IDs, but if you want to note any discrepancies (as a nice extra touch)
do so, keeping the first name encountered as being the correct one.

<p>For this part, you should submit a well commented listing (WCL) of
<tt>GradeReport</tt>, the grade reports you created for your sample
run, and your sample run showing how (well) it works. Your sample
reports should have at least 20 students from at least 4 majors. Of
course, the grades should be reasonably distributed. Include also (of
course) an explanation of the sample runs, stating how they show that
your script works well.

<p>&nbsp;

<li>For this part, create a shell script, <tt>GpaReport</tt>, which
takes as input the output of the <tt>GradeReport</tt> script of part 1.
<tt>GpaReport</tt> computes the GPA of each student for the three
courses reported. Assume that each course is worth of 3 credits. For
each student, the report should have a single line with that student's
name, ID, and GPA in the first 3 columns plus a fourth column with a
single character determined as follows: "!" if the GPA is below 2.0,
"$" if the GPA is above 3.7, and "*" otherwise.

<p>For this part, submit the same type of WCL and sample runs with
explanations as you did for the previous part.

<p>&nbsp;

<li>Create a shell script, GpaMail, which takes as its input both
the output of GpaReport (from part 2) and another file containing a
list of student information (one student per line): ID, e-mail
address, and major. GpaMail computes the average GPA for each major and
then creates e-mail messages to be sent to each student advising
that student of his/her GPA and the average for his/her major. If the
grade is below the average for the major, the message should include an
appropriate notification (e.g., "Watch out, GPA is below average for
your major!").

<p>For this part, submit the same type of WCL and sample runs with
explanations as you did for the previous parts.

</ol>

<p>&nbsp; <p><b>Note:</b>  

<p>This homework requires solutions related
with awk. Functions may be considered as necessary.

<p>For all 3 parts (scripts), your solution may well create
some intermediate file(s). If so, they should be named in such a way
that you could run more than one copy of the program at the same time,
and they should be deleted when the script exits. You need not actually
send the e-mail. It is sufficient that you echo to the screen a line
giving the command that would e-mail the message to the given address.
