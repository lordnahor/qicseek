Server makes the choice: delete the reference with the target, or decline to delete the target
</UL><UL>
(Declining to delete the target is a security risk -- clients can prevent servers from ever deleting anything by creating strong references)
</UL><UL>
(Other possible strategies: If the target of a strong reference is deleted, it becomes an internal member of one of the collections that has a strong reference to it.  Let the owner of the target resource decide how integrity is to be maintained.)</UL> </P>
