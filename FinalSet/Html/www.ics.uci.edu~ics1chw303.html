<LI><A NAME="QQ1"><H2>What is the World-Wide Web?</H2></A>
The World-Wide Web(aka WWW or W3) is a network of information accessible
 world-wide through the Internet. 
 <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/TheProject">WWW</A> was developed
 at <A HREF="http://www.cern.ch/">CERN</A>(the European Particle Physics
 Laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland as a means for computer users from remote
 sites to access a variety of information with a consistent user interface.
  To view a Web document, one needs a Web browser(e.g. Mosaic, Netscape, 
etc...).  Web documents are written in HTML(Hypertext Markup Language).  Web
 documents contains links--that is, if one clicks on the highlighted link--it
 takes one to another document that is identified by a
 <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/urls.html">URL</A>
(Uniform Resource Locators).  Many interesting things can be found on the Web
 by <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/DataSources/bySubject/Overview.html">
subject</A>. 
<p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ2"><H2>What is HTML?</H2></A>
Web documents are written in HTML(Hypertext Markup Language).  An HTML
 document contains high-lighted links which if one clicks on it--can take them
 to a different document or other resources on the Internet
(via <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/urls.html">URL</A>'s within
 the link).  An HTML document is structured so that any Web browser
(e.g. Mosaic, Netscape, etc...) can read it and display it within the
 capabilities of the computer system that one is working on.  Using HTML,
 one concentrates on the document's structure--<B>NOT</B> on the document's
 appearance--this enables developers of Web documents to express their ideas
 and not have to worry about whether any Web browser will be able to
 interpret and display their pages.  To see what an HTML document looks like,
 if you are using Mosaic, go to the <B>File</B> option and click on
 <B>View Source</B>.  As one can see, &lt; and &gt; 
dominate the document.  These are called tags(sequences of characters 
that start with &lt; and end with &gt;). 
 <A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Internet/WWW/HTMLPrimer.html">
NCSA's Beginner's Guide to HTML</A> has some excellent
 information on how to construct an HTML doucment.  Another good 
reference on HTML documentation is <A 
HREF="http://www.utirc.utoronto.ca/HTMLdocs/NewHTML/htmlindex.html">Univeristy
 of Toronto's HTML Documentation</A>.

<LI><A NAME="QQ3"><H2>What is Mathematics?</H2></A>
Mathematics is the language of science without which we could not possibly
 have our present comfort and progress in civilization.  Just as physics
 describes the the phenomena of nature--mathematics is the language which is
 used to described the phenomena.  What other language in the world is
 understood universally?  It is Mathematics--2 + 2 =4 is understood by
 everybody worldwide. 
 <A HREF="http://euclid.math.fsu.edu/Science/Specialized.html">Mathematics</A>
 is a hallowed established science.  Mathematics has been studied
 world-wide since ancient times.  Look at
 <A HREF="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/mathhist/earth.html">history of
 mathematics by region</A> for interesting contributions in mathematics
 from mathematicians world-wide since the beginning of time.  The
 <A HREF="http://www.mathpro.com/math/mathCenter.html">Internet Guide for
 Mathematics Problems</A> has some Putnam exam questions along with the
 answers.

<LI><A NAME="QQ4"><H2>Why are math graduate students frustrated?</H2></A>
Is it because <H3>
<OL>
<LI>The program is stressful and difficult?
<LI>Graduate Advisers give the students the chilly-willys?
<LI>Reading all those abstract mathematics texts gives them vertigo? 
 What actually is a ring?
<LI>Dealing with undergraduates--i.e. trying to keep your composure when
 you are the teaching assistant for Pre-calculus--a class for those
 undergraduates who haven't taken math since the seventh grade.
<LI>The job market is lousy for Ph.D mathematicians--especially those seeking
 a tenured-track faculty position at colleges and universities.  One can 
see this frustration by reading
 <A HREF="gopher://e-math.ams.org/11/genInfo/cym">
Conerns of Young Mathematicians</A>.
<LI>Andrew Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem has some holes in it.
<LI>They should have been in the <A HREF="http://mat.gsia.cmu.edu">
Operations Research</A>(mathematical modelling of real-world problems)
 program instead--that's where all the big money is along with

<LI><A NAME="QQ5"><H2>How does one become a successful graduate student?</H2></A>
For any of you who are considering continuing your education with a 
graduate degree should take a look at
 <A HREF="http://www.cs.umbc.edu/cmsc/graduate/info.html">Information for
 Graduate Students</A>.  This Web page is basically for computer science
 graduate students but it has some relevant and worthwhile topics to
 consider--including Piroz Mohseni's
 <A HREF="http://www.cs.umbc.edu/cmsc/graduate/apply-to-gradschool.ps">A
 Guide for Applying to Graduate Schools</A>. One should also research
 potential graduate schools and their programs--a good place to start is
 <A HREF="http://www.mit.edu:8001/people/cdemello/univ.html">College and
 University Home Pages</A>.  Some quick tips: 
<H3> 
<UL>
<LI>Start the process early--preferably when you are a sophomore or junior
in undergraduate study.
<LI>Investigate some schools that you are interested in applying to--that
way you can structure your undergraduate course work so as to meet their
requirements.
<LI>Prepare for the GRE(Graduate Record Exam).  Everyone must take the
General GRE--some schools may require you to take the Subject GRE also--
check the programs that you are interested in applying to.
<LI>Try to maintain a good GPA.  Most schools require that you have at
least a 3.0 to apply.
<LI>Get to know <B>AT LEAST THREE or FOUR professors reasonably well</B>, i.e.,
attend lectures regularly, attend their office hours, and do reasonably well
in their class.  This is important since most graduate programs require three
letters of recommendations--at least two must be from academia. 
<LI>Write your Statement of Purpose <B>AT LEAST TWO MONTHS IN ADVANCE</B>.
You should also have at least two people to proofread and evaluate your
Statement.
<LI>When you ask letters of reference from your professors--make sure you
include the necessary forms, a copy of your current transcript, a copy of
your Statement of Purpose, and stamped envelopes for the schools that
you are applying to.  <B>MOST IMPORTANTLY, WRITE A THANK-YOU LETTER TO THE
PROFESSOR--HEY, THEY'RE DOING YOU A FAVOR!!</B>
<LI>Be aware of deadlines for the schools that you are applying to!!
</UL>
