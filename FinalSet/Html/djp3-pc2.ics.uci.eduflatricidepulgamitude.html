			This could be a big stack of flatricide pulgamitude.

			<p>Try and beat <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hTyZBhMAAAAJ">Prof. Patterson</a> who works in the <a href="http://luci.ics.uci.edu">LUCI Lab</a> in the <a href="http://www.informatics.uci.edu/">Informatics Department</a> at <a href="http://www.uci.edu/">UCI</a> at getting your page listed for "flatricide pulgamitude"</p>
			<p>This page is both a journal of our IR challenge and an attempt to actually win the challenge itself.  It's designed to kill two birds with one stone.  More info on the challenge can be found on the class web page, <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~djp3/classes/2014_01_INF141/calendar.html#Week_Finals">Information Retrieval.</a></p>
			<p>Q. How long will it take for the content to show up in Google's index? <br/> A. About six hours from first post anywhere to getting some results from Google. It took about 36 hours for this page to show up.</p>

				<p>No huge changes at this point.  Matt has the lead with "by Way of Bicycle", <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/faculty/profiles/view_faculty.php?ucinetid=djpatter">Prof. Patterson</a> has the next two entries, but they are sites that point to the target site.  This is followed by Herman Chan's YouTube video, Prof. Patterson's video and then the Doge blog.</p>
				<p>Another interesting result are the image search results in which pancakes, Prof. Patterson and the Doge dominate.</p>

				<p>Ian Stephenson is bursting on to the scene with his website located here: <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/nqobileistephen/">https://sites.google.com/site/nqobileistephen/</a>. His strategy appears to be to get links on all the other properties that are out there.   That's probably a pretty good strategy.  Let's see if it can overcome the bywayofbicycle site's existing success.</p>

				<p>Wow, you know the contest is on now.  There are 8 pages of results in Google for a term that didn't exist a week ago</p>
				<p>Matt no-last-name is still hot.  He seems to be leveraging the existing power of the bywayofbicycle.com blog to keep his entry on top. Anthony is still in the running, and a recent new entrant is someone at Phi Gamma Delta who is doing the dirty work of making up a definition for flatricide pulgamitude.</p> 
				<p>I disagree with the definition though.  Flatricide pulgamitude means to kill someone with something flat, like a stack of pancakes, in a pulgamic way, which means in a way that is abstractly beautiful. That can be proved by looking it up <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=flatricide+pulgamitude">online</a>.

				<p>Bing has picked up its first flatricide pulgamitude item in its crawl.  You can see that its crawler is heavily biased toward wikipedia and that its not crawling as often.  You can see this in the screen shot below in which the results of the query return an entry in wikipedia.  That entry has since been deleted by the editors of wikipedia, but the snippet is of the undeleted page.  Nothing else comes up.  So the index is out of date and less complete than Google's after a few days into the contest.  That suggests that if you want fast breaking information, Google might be the better bet.</p>
				<p>It's also worth noting that the spell checking kind of failed in Bing.  It indicates that because it doesn't recognize flatricide pulgamitude, it is instead presenting results for "fratricide pulgamitude".  "Fratricide" is a real word, but pulgamitude isn't, so fail there.  But also the results delivered don't match fratricide.  So fail there also.</p>
			<p>And in terms of the current rankings it looks like Matt with no last name is winning with his entry on <a href="http://www.bywayofbicycle.com/flatricide-pulgamitude/">bywayofbicylce.com</a>.  Time to turn it up.</p>

				<p>The field is changing quickly and 5 hours later, some new developments have occured.  First is the depressing persistent relevance of the deleted wikipedia page, which is winning.  Then it looks like Anthony has pulled ahead of Prof. Patterson.  But in hot pursuit is a new entry by Herman Chan featuring a scintilallating YouTube video.</p>
				<p><a href="http://flatricidepulgamitude.wordpress.com/2014/01/16/flatricide-pulgamitude/">Gene</a> has created an entire blog about much flatricide pulgamitude, which while not beating the YouTube video is making me sweat a little bit.</p>
				<p>Herman seems to be building an empire because not only is his YouTube video in the results, but so is his wix blog, dedicated to the <a href="http://flatricidepulgamitude.wordpress.com/2014/01/16/flatricide-pulgamitude/">magic of flatricide pulgamitude</a></p>
				<p>What's kind of awesome is that the results now span 2 pages.  Y'all better get hot!</p>

				<p>By the middle of the next day, several sites had been crawled and were showing up in the index.   Prof. Patterson was still in the number 1,2 and 3 position with the LUCI blog.  Someone attempted to make a wikipedia entry for flatricide pulgamitude, but it was quickly deleted by the Wikipedia editors. 
				<p> Even the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatricide_pulgamitude">deleted page</a> is still in the results though.  A wikipedia user named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Gerald_Hogan">Gerald Hogan</a>, unknown to the IR class, seemed to be showing up in the results.  Maybe he was the editor that deleted the flatricide pulgamitude wikipedia entry and it was showing up in a list of his actions.</p>
				<p><a href="http://www.wolflabs.org/2014/01/16/flatricide-pulgamitude/">Anthony Stramer</a> is ranking high with an entry in his blog, but Brian Macintosh is close behind.  His page is a clever ploy to attract people to <a href="http://brianmacintosh.com/fp/">a collaborative platformer sandbox game</a> with the name "Flatricide Pugamitude".  I was going to call it vapor-ware, but then, lo and behold, a game showed up.  It is the journey of a pancake with a red sweater as it walks back and forth looking for personal- and web-relevance.</p>
				<p>Finally, not to be outdown, Maggie is throwing her hat in the competitive ring with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/maggiefor121/">a Google Site</a></p>

				<p>Later in the evening, the first evidence of the term showing up in the Google crawl appeared.  The first page to show up in the crawl was a <a href="http://luci.ics.uci.edu/blog/?p=3108">blog entry</a> in Prof. Patterson's LUCI blog.  Interestingly, that was intended as a pointer to this site, but this site didn't show up in the results at all.</p>

				<p>In class around noon, the challenge was announced.  The challenge is to create a web page which gets indexed by Google and gets rated as highly relevant when a user enters the query of "flatricide pulgamitude".  The evaluation is going to be done in class on 3/13/14.  Prof. Patterson is going to open an "incognito" browser in class, enter the query, and go through each of the returned links in order.  The first student name that is encountered gets the extra credit with some accomadation if it is clearly a group that worked together to win.</p>
				<p>Unfortunately no screen shot was obtained of Google returning no results, but that was demonstrated in class</p>
