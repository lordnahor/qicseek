<LI> In LZSS (the version of LZ77 due to Storer and Szymanski),
a short match can be represented by either (<I>F,P,L</I>)
(flag,pointer,length) or by (<I>F,C</I>) (flag,character).
If the window length is W=4096 and the maximum match length is M=256,
what is the shortest match that one would represent as a match rather
than as uncompressed characters?
<P>
<LI> Analyze the LZW compression of the string "<tt>aaaa</tt>...",
     for input length 1 million.
<P>
<LI> What is the longest string that can be retrieved from the LZW
    dictionary during decoding when the input text had length 1 billion?
<P>
<LI> Assume a two-symbol alphabet with the symbols {<tt>a, b</tt>}.
     Show the first 15 dictionary entries for the LZW encoding
     of the string: <tt>ababababababab</tt>...
<P>
<LI> In BWT, the last column, L, of the sorted matrix contains
     concentrations of identical characters, which is why L is easy
     to compress.  However, the first column, F, of the same matrix
     is even easier to compress since it contains runs,
     not just concentrations.  Why select column L and not column F?
<P>
<LI> Using BWT for string S="<tt>sssssssssh</tt>"
     calculate string L and its MTF compression.
