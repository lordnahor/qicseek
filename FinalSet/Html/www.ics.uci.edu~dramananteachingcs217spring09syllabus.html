<h1>Syllabus</h1>

The course will be split into two five-week sections. 
<hr>
The first half will focus on 3D understanding and recognition from inverse light transport. 
<br><br>
1. Intro - cameras, lenses, sensors <br>
2. Image Formation - radiometry, light transport, dynamic range <br>
3. BRDF - reflectance maps, specularities <br>
4. Material Recognition - microfacets, subsurface scattering <br>
5. Global versus local shading models - inter-reflections, low-dimensional light transport <br>
6. Algorithms: color constancy (retinex), photometric stereo, shape from shading, shape from texture <br>
<br>
<hr>
The second half will focus on multiview geometry.
<br> <br>
1. Rigid body motion - rodrigues formula, quaternions <br>
2. Camera models - radial distortion, perspective projection <br>
3. Projective Geometry - conics, planar homographies, overview of stratification <br>
4. Camera Calibration - autocalibration <br>
5. Mathematics of multi-view geometry - essential matrix, fundamental matrix, epipolar geometry, 8-point algorithm <br>
6. Estimation - least squares, bundle adjustment <br>
7. Practical Concerns - feature point detection, description, RANSAC <br>
8. Projection of smooth surfaces - differential geometry, occluding contours, aspect graphs <br>
9. Structure from motion - rigid/multi-body/non-rigid factorization <br>
10. Stereo reconstruction - dynamic programming, graph cuts, structured-light, multi-view <br>
