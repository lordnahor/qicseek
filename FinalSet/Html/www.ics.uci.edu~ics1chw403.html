<H2>Introduction</H2>
The study of<a href="http://c.gp.cs.cmu.edu:5103/prog/webster?anthropology"> 
anthropology</a> is not often considered outside of its 
known context of human culture and evolution. Most people can tell you that 
anthropology deals with the exotic ways of the worlds people, that 
anthropology is a sort of record of different ethnic and cultural 
groups, and that anthropologists also study human evolution. It is 
because of this latter aspect of the field that people often comment to 
the effect of "oh anthropology, so are you going to go digging in the 
deserts of Africa?" And while archaeology is, in fact, a facet of 
anthropology, they are not one in the same. In fact, anthropology is 
actually such a wide-ranging field that at times it becomes difficult to 
classify. <p>     
In an introduction to anthropology course, one is often taught that the 
discipline can be generally divided into four categories. These are 
cultural (includes social anthropology-these are sometimes seperate 
categories) anthropology, physical or biological anthropology, archaeology, 
and linguistics. Here, cultural anthropology is meant to define the 
study of various cultures and their unique characteristics, both cultural 
and social. Physical 
anthropology is the study of human evolution. Archaeology defines the 
systematic recovery and scientific study of material evidence remaining from 
past human cultures, and linguistics encompasses the study of human languages 
including grammer and technical relationships. However useful these categories
may be, I believe it will soon become evident that anthropology is actually 
much farther reaching.<p>    

In this paper I would like to present an overview of many of the more 
specialized fields within the discipline and focus on one of them in 
particular-ethnomusicology. This will not be an exhaustive look at the 
different subcategories of anthropology, but instead, will be designed to 
give an idea as to the vastness of the field.<p>

<H2>An Overview</H2>
The specialized fields of anthropology are, in general, extensions of the 
four categories mentioned above. However, the more detailed or limited in 
scope a specialized field becomes, the more it seems to combine not only 
these different categories but also it begins to incorporate different 
disciplines entirely.<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/v-lib/anthropology.html"> 
The World-Wide Web Virtual Library anthropology section</a> gives a good 
idea as to the depth that anthropological specialized fields contain.<p>

Beginning with an example which would loosely be placed under the 
category cultural anthropology, we can look at <a 
href="http://www.pitt.edu/~cjp/rees.html"> Russian and East European Studies
</a>. This extensive study covers cultural, political, social, and linguistic 
issues. For instance, one can take a "virtual museum tour" of the 
Treasures of the Czars, look at population statistics, or look at a map of 
the Commonwealth of Independent States. Also, there are links to political 
issues such as the <a 
href="http://www.umd.umich.edu:80/dept/armenian/">Armenian 
Reasearch Center</a> which covers Armenian history, 
genocide, and the current stuggle in Nagorno-Karabagh. The linguistics 
resource area covers many Russian and East European languages such as 
Estonian, Slovenian, and Russian. Clearly, this study combines at least 
three of the categories mentioned above.<p>

Likewise, <a href="http://coombs.anu.edu.au/WWWVL-AsianStudies.html">Asian 
Studies</a> programs are also broadening. One can 
find extensive information concerning the Asian continent, language and 
literature, art, and Asian religions including <a 
href="http://www.utexas.edu/students/amso/">Islam</a> and <a 
href="http://www.psu.edu/jbe/resource.html"> Buddhism</a>. A very 
modern area of research in cultural anthropology concerns gangs. I found 
an interesting document in this area entitled <a 
href="http://cwis.usc.edu/dept/elab/buidoi/vietgangs.html"><i> Life in a 
Vietnamese Gang</i></a>. This study began as a film at the University of 
Southern California and is about a 20 year old Vietnamese guy named Richy Phan
who gets involved with a gang here in Orange County. I found this document 
particularly interesting as it includes gang poetry and a letter from Richy 
Phan in jail. Also, this study is a good example of contemporary cultural 
anthropology mixing traditional techniques with film.

<p><a href="http://english-server.hss.cmu.edu/langs.html"> 
Linguistics</a> is the one subcategory of anthropology that is the 
most straight forward. It is generally studied by linguists, although 
anthropologists frequently collect the information, and is usually 
restricted to the study of one language although there are also 
comparative studies. At the same time, human evolution, which is just one 
of the
subcategories of anthropology, has itself many facets. Under the area of
<a href="http://golgi.harvard.edu/biopages/evolution.html"> Evolution</a>
in the WWW Virtual Library anthropology section several of these facets
are listed. From this document human evolution seems to cover not only the
study of primate and human development across time, but also includes
biochemistry, molecular biology, genetics, and ecology to mention a few. 
So it seems that human evolution, like so many other areas of
anthropology, combines with other disciplines in its studies. <p> 

Although the examples above give an idea as to the incorporated 
subcategories and disciplines that anthropological studies entail, it is 
easier to get an idea of the multiple areas of anthropology by 
visiting a few of these specialized or limited areas of study. 
<UL>
<LI>
<a href="http://spirit.lib.uconn.edu/ArchNet/Topical/Ethno/Ethno.html">
Ethnoarchaeology and Ethnohistory</a> is an interesting field 
dealing with the archaeology and history of specific ethnic groups. This 
site includes documents which are ethnic historical and documents on the 
interpretation of specific archaeological finds.
<LI><a href="http://webnet.com.au/koori/homekori.html"> The Australian 
Indigenous Populations Study</a> is a sight that incorporates traditional 
cultural anthropology such as social control and cultural resilience with 
other displines such as law (aboriginal land rights), history, and fine 
arts. </UL>   

<H2>Ethnomusicology</H2>

Ethnomusicology is a specialized field of anthropology which combines 
cultural anthropology and music. This limited area of study is unique in 
that it is not offered at many universities and in that it requires some 
background knowledge in the <a 
href="http://http.ecn.bgu.edu/users/mfjpm/class/elements.html"> elements of 
music</a>, such as pitch, rhythm, melody, and harmony. The 
anthropological aspect of this area comes into play with the collection 
of data. Anthropologists, in this case ethnomusicologists, will collect 
the relevant data (music) by using a classic cultural anthropology 
technique called field study. With a field study, the researcher will 
actually physically go to the place of interest (ex. Iran), stay for a 
fair period of time (often 6 months to 2 years), and collect information 
by personal interview. During this time the researcher will learn the 
language and cultural features of the given country, become friendly with 
the people, and conduct his/her investigative study.<p>

Studies in ethnomusicology try to study and understand the music of 
different ethnic groups in the context of that group's cultural 
characeristics and traits. They ask questions such as, for instance, 
"what element of African tribal culture makes their music abundant in 
slow beating drum rythms?" Although the focus of these types of studies 
are on the music rather than the culture, the culture is, of course, an 
influential factor in that music. <p>

Studies in ethnomusicology have been conducted on many different 
countries and ethnic groups within those countries (ex. studies on 
Jewish music within Turkish culture). For example, studies have been done 
on the music of <a 
href="http://http.ecn.bgu.edu/users/mfjpm/class/latin.html"> 
Latin America</a>,<a 
href="http://http.ecn.bgu.edu/users/mfjpm/class/africa.html"> 
Subsaharan Africa</a>, and <a 
href="http://http.ecn.bgu.edu/users/mfjpm/class/India.html"> India</a>. 
These studies 
often focus on the non-Western elements of the music and compare these 
elements to Western standards. Also, these type of studies often focus 
on the religious music of the culture and its influence on the popular 
style. In fact, studies in ethnomusicology have amounted steadily and 
there is now a Web site called <a 
href="http://umbc7.umbc.edu/~signell/efhm/index.html"> 
EthnoForum/hypermedia</a> that deals exclusively with ethnomusicology.<p>

Since ethnomusicology is such an unusual and concentrated area of study, 
it is best to browse through one of these studies to get an idea as to 
their content and form. An excellent comprehensive example of an 
ethnomusicological study is entitled <a 
href="http://www.reg.uci.edu/UCI/FACULTY/RGARFIAS/BURMA/burma1.html"><i> 
The Burmese Piano Music of V KO KO</i></a> and was done by Prof. Robert 
Garfias 
here at UCI. This study includes historical context, musical style and 
framework, and the characteristics of that specific cultures musical 
facets. It is well worth it to visit this site and gain an 
understanding as to the fundamentals of ethnomusicology research. 
    

<H2>Conclusion</H2>
I think that anthropology has been affected positively by the World-Wide Web. 
It has given the field an avenue to public awareness and it has given 
anthropologists a way to stay on top of recent research. In conclusion, 
anthropology was not always such a wide ranging area of study. If fact, at 
its inseption it was a fairly narrow field, limited to matters of human 
evolution and traditional cultural studies. However, anthropology is now a 
discipline which has not only broadened in scope in recent years, but 
continues to grow.
