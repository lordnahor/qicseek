  <p class="style5">General Philosophy: </p>
  <div class="indentRight">
    <p>I prefer to give many small assignments which build up a picture of overall student learning success rather than to rely on one or two large exams which students may bomb based on non-learning related complications.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>At the end of the day, learning is the responsibility of the student. I consider myself someone who points students in the right direction and can/will explain the fundamentals of a subject  matter. I can't actually do the work of learning for a student. That takes effort and self-initiative. I will help to provide structure and motivation for that learning, but  you also need to learn how to expand on this subject yourself.  In a technical field like this,  you will be left behind the field in about six months, regardless of how well I present the subject matter, if you can't keep learning on your own. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I like to stop talking periodically and let students ask questions. </p>

  <div class="indentRight"></div>

<div class="container">
  <p class="style5">Class Attendance:</p>
  <div class="indentRight">
    <p> Attendance will be kept track of through index cards at the beginning of class. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The index cards are also a means for me to get feedback about the course.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>For each class please write your name on a card, the date, your student ID and a comment/question about the course.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If you would like to submit an anonymous comment, take an extra card and don't put your name on it. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I keep track of attendance because I need consistent class participation in order to make this course function well. </p>

<div class="container">
  <p class="style5">Design Notebook: </p>
  <div class="indentRight">
    <p>There is not a  requirement for a  design notebook this class.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="container">
  <div class="indentRight">
    <p>Several  assignments will be assigned consisting primarily of group learning tasks. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The goal of the projects will be to get hands on experience with user interface development techniques.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="indentRight"></div>
</div>
<div class="container">
  <p class="style5">Quizzes</p>
  <div class="indentRight">
    <p>Several quizzes will be  assigned covering the assigned readings and in-class discussions.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The goal of the quizzes is to motivate you to learn the material in the text book and lecture in preparation for class exercises.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Each reading assignment will have a quiz associated with it.  The quizzes will be due at the end of the quarter.</p>

  <p class="style5">Laptop use </p>
  <div class="indentRight">
    <p>I am going to request that you close your laptops during this class. There will be a lot of exercises that won't work if you are day-trading at the same time (or whatever). </p>
