		<description><![CDATA[The idea of emoticons is interesting, Citizen Deux.  

In fact, you are just a bit ahead of me in terms of my postings.  
I will soon talk about textual words being a subset of words and language being an evolving language -- and the points that you make are directly related to that.

Jay, it will be great to hear your thoughts.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Can textual words, in fact, have emotions?  A long time ago during a linguistics course at Georgia Tech we were studying the prospects of AI and its possible interpretations of words.  As the internet has become ubiquitous and a legion of uninhibited users (meaning everyone younger than me) has filed into this space, I contend that new textual words have arrived complete with emotion embedded within.  

Could we not view the constructed emoticons as a new type of word?  If I post ;-), is the message as clear as if I did wink at you?  What about hybrid words, loosely described as 733T (leet) speak?  Most people familiar with the net understand what lol means.]]></description>
