<h3>Procedures</h3>
<p>
Programming assignments are typically due one week after they are assigned,
  at 11:30pm, typically on a Thursday night (but look for exceptions).
To turn in programs, and verify the submission, use the
  <a href="http://checkmate.ics.uci.edu" target="main">
  Checkmate Homework Dropoff</a> system: it is also available on the
  standard frame index on the course website: it uses UCInetID Secure Web
  Login.
You receive <b>NO POINTS</b> for late programs, unless you have discussed the
  matter with me and gotten my official permission (typically, granted prior
  to the due date, always via email and not just orally; contact me as soon as
  possible).
<p>
<b>IN ALL CASES, you must drop off (on time) whatever part of the program you
  have written</b>, if you are to receive any partial credit for a submission
  (either on time or late with permission); if you drop off <b>no</b> files, I
   must assume that you have done <b>no</b> work on the assignment (which will
  result in a grade of 0 for it).
<p>


<h3>Pair Programming</h3>
We will use <b>pair programming</b> on most assignments (either <b>required</b>
  or <b>recommended</b>, although it is sometimes <b>prohibited</b>); it is only
  on these assignments that students can closely collaborate with their
  partners, turning in one copy of a jointly written program.
See <a href="../common/handouts/pairprogramming.html">Pair Programming</a> for
  details about pair programming, and the right and wrong ways to do it.
There is a tremendous amount to be gained by both partners, if they pair
  program the right way.
<p>
You can keep the same partner for multiple assignments or switch.
Try to find a partner in your lab who has approximately your skill level and
  study habits (e.g., working evening vs. weekends, work ethic to submit
  programs early); try to find someone who lives near you (or with whom you
  can easily meet outside lab) because I expect partners will need time outside
  labs to finish the prgrams.
<p>
If you are having difficulty finding a partner, or believe that your schedule
  or life-circumstances disallow the ability to work in a pair, contact me
  immediately by email.
Without making prior arrangments with me, individual students submitting a
  program when pairing is required will have their grade reduced substantially.
<p>

<h3>Starting/Finishing Programs</h3>
Please read each assignment completely and carefully before starting it.
I suggest that you print and then read it, marking relevant material with a
  highlighter (details that you might forget by the end of an assignment).
Then, re-read the assignment before submitting your work.
Programs are typically assigned on Thursday and due the following Thursday;
  students should plan to have finished their current programs on Wednesday, so
  they can start on the new programs in lab on Thursday; see below for how this
  leads to extra credit.
<p>

<h3>Extra Points for Submitting Early</h3>
If you drop off your program early, you will receive extra points (1 point if
  you submit it 24 hours early, 2 points if you submit it 48 hours early).
Since each program is worth 50 points, you can raise your grade on a program
  by 4% (almost half a letter grade) by turning it in two days early.
Note that turning in a program more than two days early results in just
  2 extra points: the maximum you can get).
<p>

<h3>Identifying Submissions</h3>

Only <b>ONE STUDENT</b> should submit the assignment (all parts of it).
If students work in pairs, <b>BOTH NAMES</b> and their lab numbers must
  appear in a comment at the top of each submitted program; e.g.,
<pre><b>
# Romeo Montague, Lab 1
# Juliet Capulet, Lab 1
# We certify that we worked cooperatively on this programming
#   assignment, according to the rules for pair programming</b></pre>

If this information does not appear at the top of your submission, there
  will be a 1 point deduction.

<h3>Multiple Submissions</h3>
Checkmate allows students to remove a submission and then resubmit.
We will grade only your final submission (and extra credit points are based on
  only that submission).
I encourage students to finish their programs as early as possible and submit
  them when they finish; doing so helps me track the progress of all the
  students in the class.
If you discover something wrong with your program after that, you can always
  correct the program, remove and resubmit it.
<p>

<h3>No Retrieval</h3>
Student cannot retrieve a submission from Checkmate; so, you are responsible
  for archiving your work so that you have a copy of what you submit.
<p>
