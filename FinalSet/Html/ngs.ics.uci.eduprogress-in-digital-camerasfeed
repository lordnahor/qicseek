		<description><![CDATA[I also had Casio S500 and have later replaced by the g1 and it is quite a good piece of machinery. I REALLY wish that i would have waited! I new that they would be coming out with a g series with video. I just didn&#039;t think so soon!I cant wait to see the &quot;HD&quot; specs for it! If its 1080i @ atleast 30 frames per second. I will probably sell my g1 for the g1 hd with video! But right at this point in time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You are right, digital cameras had such an impact on photography field that the old reel cameras are almost gone now. We can control the resolution in these cameras, whether we want 4 mega Pixel (mp) picture or 8 MP but we couldn&#039;t do the same in non-digital cameras.

So there is no such point in comparing digital ones with non-digital but somehow those ones also served the human very well, when these flashy ultra modern giants were not there. Anyways, whatâ€™s next to digital cameras?]]></description>
