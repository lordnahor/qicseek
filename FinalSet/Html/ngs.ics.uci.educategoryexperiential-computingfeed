				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Data Warehouses are Chronicles</strong></p>
<p>Business enterprises have a major challenge: making efficient and effective decisions all the time.  This challenge can only be solved by knowing what the current situation in the organization is and what happened in the past in their organization. Top managers have difficulty understanding their own organization because of the size, but more importantly because the data related to the operation of the enterprise is kept in many different silos.  Business enterprises were earliest to adopt computers for data management applications.  No surprise that these enterprises were also one of the earliest to explore application of storing data for various applications not only as databases but also to collect data for different applications and then using this data to understand detailed operations and build decision support systems on top of that.</p>
<p>In 1980s the notion of data warehouses started becoming popular.  A data warehouse is an integrated and time-varying collection of data acquired from different operational data sources and is primarily used in important decision making of the enterprise.  A data warehouse represents the data from disparate sources in a unified schema and provides tools to ask aggregate queries as well as provide powerful analytical tools and visualization of data in flexible formats.   Data, which normally lived in different silos of an organization, is imported and integrated to represent it in a unified format thus allowing access to all organizations data.  By providing useful analytical and organizational tools on this data, decision makers can gain insights essential to make important decisions.  Data warehousing made ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) paradigm very popular to import data from different operations related databases into the unified schema.  Similarly, OLAP (OnLine Analytical Processing) and visualization of a segment of data in appropriate form to help in understanding data related to particular entities during a particular period received significant attention.</p>
<p>As data warehousing tools started appearing, new fields of Business Intelligence and Business Activity Monitoring evolved and became popular in 1990s.  Business Intelligence used data warehouse technology and built powerful analytical tools on top of it to provide tools to understand common business situations related to the operation of the whole enterprise.  Business Activity Monitoring unified data from different silos to provide holistic real time dashboard for common events in the enterprise.  Both these technologies built on pulling data from disparate silos and unifying all this data around entities or events and then building appropriate analytical and visualization tools.  These systems helped improve enterprise resource management, supply chain management, as well as customer relationship management .  </p>
<p>By realizing importance of storing data related to different operations and then utilizing this data to understand, or model, functioning of the overall enterprise, enterprise warehousing technologies contributed to bringing in efficiency as well as efficacy in different companies.  Data warehousing became a powerful infrastructure used by many enterprises.</p>
<p>The rapid success of enterprise warehousing could be attributed to already popular databases used by every enterprise in their different operations.  All these databases commonly used structured data to collect and store all information related to the operations.  Since this data is ever increasing, because with time more data is being collected, the challenge is to identify trends and models in operations, particularly correlating these for events taking place in different parts of the organization and hence in different databases.  Data warehouses took the first step in unifying the logs of information from different parts and providing access to them at the knowledge level.  In a sense data warehouses were an effort to provide data, information, and knowledge available in the same framework and to understand and relate them to gain understanding for making good decisions.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Chronicles are everywhere</strong></p>
<p>Importance of logs for archiving information both to verify facts in the past as well as using it to build models for predicting the future were recognized from the earliest times.  This also suggests that people recognize the importance of the Data â€“ Information â€“ Knowledge chain also long time ago.</p>
<p>Logs were maintained in many varied forms ranging from accounting logs, seasonal changes, personal life changes, events in organizations and societies, and you name it.  As the scientific curiosity increased the process of maintaining logs also became more precise and more systematic.  Precise and detailed logs would allow formation of better models, which in turn may result in more precise understanding and better predictions.  This meant encouraging people to record their observation with as little subjectivity and as much details as possible.  Rigorous protocols were developed for reporting in each area to make it less subjective and more detailed.</p>
<p>As sensing technology coupled with storage of sensed information improved this task of objectivity and details in logs started improving rapidly.  With advances in technology the task of capturing and maintaining logs became easier and hence more popular.  This encouraged logs for things that were once considered too expensive.  Even ordinary people started maintaining diaries and started capturing photos and maintaining albums.</p>
<p>It is very instructive to analyze all around us at different levels and see how many different levels of logs are now maintained.  Some logs that we normally donâ€™t think about are logs like the Black Box in an aeroplane.  This is commonly called a Flight Data Recorder or Accident Data Recorder and is slowing entering even cars.  This box records important flight parameters as well as cockpit conversations.  Blackbox is designed to be tough enogh to withstand major accidents so it can survive the accident to report what was going on at the time of the accident.  Whenever an accident takes place, this box provides the most valuable information to design safer planes and help reduce accidents.</p>
<p>Another very common log that we are all becoming very familiar is the omni-present surveillance videos.  You may recall that like many other past events, recently after the Boston Marathon Bombing, the suspects were caught by analyzing the videos captured by surveillance videos in the bombed area.</p>
<p>One area where strong noticeable progress has been made in the last century is weather forecasting.  By collecting past data and using them to build careful models, now it is possible to predict weather much better.  At one time, the only method to predict weather was the past record or the history of weather at a particular place.  Now by using ma multitude of sensors, one can carefully record the current states and using models one can predict the future of weather at the place.  This has become so common place that we have started relying on it to predict many of our everyday activities.  This is a clear demonstration of how logs can be combined to create models that could be used to predict future.  We see a clear collaboration between calendars and chrnicles in weather forecasting.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Bringing Objectivity in Chronicles</strong></p>
<p>Capturing experiential information (such as photo, audio, and video) using sensors was revolutionary.  It transformed how events were reported.  Earlier a reporter used his subjective observations in chronicles or stories and the strongest statement a reporter could make was: â€œI was there and I saw it with my own eyes.â€  Since the event was witnessed by only a few people, the event was really ephemeral with no real persistent record except a subjective and selective memory of people around.  And the memory of those around could be influenced easily by rewards or punishments later.</p>
<p>Sensors are incapable of exerting subjectivity or selectivity.  Of course humans can decide placement of a sensor and its use at a particular time and that decision suffers from subjectivity and selectivity.  Once operational, however, a sensor will faithfully collect data without any interpretation.  This data needs to be interpreted to convert this to information.  The sequence: Data â€“ Information â€“ Knowledge , is well known and recognized.  In this sequence at each step abstraction is used.  Data is most concrete and one uses context and goal to extract information from data using a-priori knowledge.  The same data could be used to extract multiple types of information.  The famous phrase, â€œA picture is worth thousand wordsâ€, is a strong manifestation of this fact.  By using a different combination of goals, knowledge, and contexts, one can interpret the data to extract different information.  The context of the data is usually represented using some form of contextual data that is commonly called metadata.</p>
<p>When different humans look at the same data, due to their context and due to their different knowledge sources and goals, they usually see different information in the data.  This is a well-known fact in psychological literature.</p>
<p>When chronicles are prepared based on human reports, they naturally represent the context, knowledge, and goal of the reporter.  In a sense, a report represents as much about the reporter as it does about the event. </p>
<p>Triangulation of information, or assimilating or aggregating information from multiple sources, has been a commonly used technique to deal with imperfections and errors in the data.  Using many reports from independent sources, one hopes to get better picture of the situation.</p>
<p>When multiple types of sensors are used to capture an event, each sensor collects data related to one or more attribute.  Even we humans use five specialized sensors to experience any events in the world.  We can experience correctly only by combining information from as many appropriate senses as required.  If we use only one or limited number of senses, the information about the event may not be correct or may not be complete.  It is essential to use data from all appropriate sensors to get a correct and complete report on the event.  Equally important is to use right knowledge in extracting information.</p>
<p>Traditional chronicles gave information that was collected by humans.  No data was saved from the event.  Recording technology introduced storage of data for an event.  Photos, audios, and videos were the first recording devices that allowed this.  And that was the beginning of the end of subjective chronicles.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the longest time, people have been interested in past events as well as the discovery, collection, organization, and presentation of information about these events.   The motivations for this ranges from simply revisiting enjoyable events to creating knowledge by analyzing and relating events in many different forms.  Much of the knowledge that exists is a result of such analysis.  Events related to a person were of interest, we were the events related to any organization, place, or a collection of any person, any other living organism or any organization.  In a sense any living organism has events happening that describe itâ€™s growth and behavior.  To understand any living organism and predict its future behavior models are formed and such models are always based on the its past behavior.  It was believed that the past behavior inferred from past events is at least an indicator of future behavior.  Humans like to partially predict future for planning purpose.</p>
<p>A chronicle is a record of past events.  For individuals such chronicle were created in the form of diaries, auto-biographies, biographies, and just description of individual events.  For any organization ranging from structured minutes of meetings to just description of events from different people existed.  Even scientific records are maintained in chronicles ranging from laboratory notebooks to published research papers.  Storytelling became a popular form of presenting a sequence of such events and continues to remain so. </p>
<p>The art of chronicling evolved as civilization adopted new technology.  Earliest chronicles were oral. With writing, chronicles took new shape and gained more permanence.   But a major progress in chronicling took place with printing technology and mass adoption of print technology for dissemination of information.  The interest in chronicles related to different aspects of society resulted in introduction and rapid growth of Newspaper related technology.  Newspapers, magazines, and journals became almost daily consumption habit of people and independent of the fact that printing has evolved and now exists in digital multimedia format, the habit of following chronicles in different form continues.  Jounalism, editing, and publishing became important disciplines and will continue to remain so due to mass interest and dependence of society on chronicles.</p>
<p>With progress in digital media, we saw change in format of chronicles.  With social media, we now have democratization of chronicle creation.  Anybody can now join Facebook or Twitter and start reporting on event in their own life, their organization, or just about any thing that they observe or are interested in.  This is a huge change in chronicles.  Equally important change is the media of chronicles.  Chronicles started as report by an individual first in oral form and then in text form, which is dependent on human expression.  The last decade has seen a major change in use of photos and videos as for mass reporting of events.   Photos and videos capture the events in more objective and natural visual and audio form.  This has changed the way we like to experience events and share events.</p>
<p>But it appears that we are at the cusp of even more radical form for capturing, storing, organizing, and sharing events and creating knowledge from these events.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Due to some intriguing research issues, I started thinking about our approach to organizing, managing, and learning from timeline.  This is resulting in some interesting intellectual journeys.  In a series of posts, I will articulate my current thoughts and after some time based on my findings and feedback from you and other friends, I will create a white paper and share with you here.  </p>
<p>We are all familiar with calendars and with chronicles.  We use both.  Calendars to us represent plans and future.  Chronicles are about history and hence about past events.  We live in present.  Calendars are future and chronicles are past.  So chronicles and calendars are disjoint, they really have no overlap.  In fact even conceptually they are â€˜disjointâ€™.  Calendars represent intent and plans for events, whereas chronicles represent what events really happened.</p>
<p>Original calendars were designed for people to plan based on periodic natural events.  Two types of calendars evolved from observation of cycles associated with moon (Lunar calendars) and sun (Solar calendars).  Major festivals became landmarks on calendars and were used to plan relative events in society and also in individual life.  When to go looking for particular agricultural products or for fishing became part of these calendars.  For structuring observations, such as when seasons change to when do you feel sleepy, these calendars were divided into different granularities such as year, month, day, hours, minutes, and seconds.  These granularities were designed for humans and hence were such that people can appreciate and use these.</p>
<p>Calendars slowly evolved to become reminder mechanisms.  Calendars were used to mark the moments when particular action should be taken.  Calendars also became coordination device so more than one people could coordinate their activities.  Calendars were prepared at many levels such as an individual person, a group, an organization, country, or ethnic groups or organizations spread across the globe.  All important events of interest to a person or an organization are marked in their respective calendars.</p>
<p>Future is of great interest to most humans, if not all.  People are anxious about their future and strive for some hints about their future.  The great popularity of Astrology in many different forms is a clear indicator of this. Past is important to predict future.  One can model past for predicting future.  Most scientific discipline, and early empirical approaches due to lack of data storage and analytical techniques, are usually concerned with modeling observations from the past to be able to predict the future.</p>
<p>Early chronicles are reports on events that took place at similar level on the structured time line.   Their goal is to save data related to events that could be used in modeling the past.  <strong> (Nature of chronicles coming soon.)</strong></p>
