<h2>Asthama Awareness</h2>
Using Real Time Collective Intelligence for Medical Applications Progress in technology has made collection and utilization of data and information from numerous sources in real time possible. The access to real-time collective information is spanning many unique and novel applications that were beyond imagination just a few years ago. In our Social Life Networks project, we are building an environment to facilitate such applications. In the following we discuss one such application that we would like to consider as an example for implementing our approach.
Asthma affects 15 million Americans, 5 million of whom are children. Further, 90% of all asthma cases are extrinsic, i.e. allergic asthma and 80% of children with asthma also have documented allergies. It is well documented that better planning of daily activities can minimize risk of severe asthma attacks. We started a project which aggregates and processes publically available data (pollution, pollen data, human reports i.e. ‘tweets’) to give personalized recommendations to individuals affected by Asthma/ allergies. Such a system can also be used at different granularities by National (State, or County) level health authorities or insurance agencies to monitor and raise alerts/ advisories to the residents.
