<H1>U.S. Presidential Nominations</H1>

<H2>The Selection Process</H2>

<P>
Few political events in the United States stimulate as much 
interest as presidential campaigns. While the President of the <A 
HREF="http://www.city.net/countries/united_states/">United 
States</A> is said to hold the world's most powerful office, he and the <A 
HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov/White_House/EOP/First_Lady/html/HILLARY_Bio.html"> 
First Lady</A> also get to be the residents of the prestigious <A 
HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">White 
House</A>. Accordingly, the <A 
HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov/White_House/Family/html/Clintons_First_Year.html">President</A> 
and <A HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov/White_House/EOP/OVP/html/Bio.html">Vice-President</A> 
are the only public officials chosen by the entire 
national electorate. The presidency has evolved into the focal point and 
energizing force in the American political system. If Presidents are of 
great consequence in the scheme of things, so too must be the way we go 
about choosing them.<P> 
Most of the delegates to the <A 
HREF="ftp://ftp.senate.gov/committee/Dem-Policy/general/dpc.html">Democratic 
</A>and <A 
HREF="ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/ko/kosborn/www/contract.html">Republican</A> 
conventions are selected in the presidential primaries, in which the 
voters go to the polls and <A HREF="http://www.oclc.org/VoteSmart/lwv/pvstxt.htm">vote</A> for their preferred candidate. This was 
promoted around the turn of the century by reformers who wanted to take 
nominations out of the hands of the party bosses and let the people vote 
for the candidate of their choice.<P>
Among the democracies of the world, the U.S. stands alone in 
according its citizens a significant role in determining who their choices 
shall be for the highest office in the land. There are many great 
advantages of the way we go about selecting our Democratic and <A 
HREF="http://www.umr.edu/~sears/primary/main.html">Republican 
presidential nominees</A>:<P>
<OL>
<LI>it is the most open and participatory 
process for selecting party leaders anywhere in the democratic world
<LI>provides more 
minority representation
<LI>gives outside candidates a chance 
<LI>most importantly, it represents the only system that the American people 
today are willing to accept<P>

<H2>Critiques About The Selection Process</H2>
At various points throughout political history, the 
Presidential nomination process has been subject to changes designed to 
render it more open to popular participation. 
But one of the consequences of the reforms of the 1970's on the presidential 
nomination process is that there is an increase in out-party contenders 
as well as for the more challenges to Presidential incumbents. Some 
critics argue that the reforms have made an incumbent President more 
vulnerable to challenge, and consequently, he is forced to divert 
energies from more weighty matters of governing and focus attention on 
securing renomination. 
<A HREF="http://http2.sils.umich.edu/FordLibrary/DayInTheLife.html">Gerald 
Ford</A>, for example, claims that in 1976 he 
was compelled to devote 20 percent of his time to his bid for the 
Republican nomination.<P>
Another criticism of the nomination process is that it has become 
so long and arduous that many able individuals are discouraged from even 
entering the race and does not bring forward the most qualified 
candidates. In every selection since 1972 the complaint that "surely we 
can do better than this" has been widely voiced with respect to the 
nominees of one or both of the parties. Throughout the 1988 nomination 
cycle, the press called attention to the "lightweight" quality of the 
Democratic contenders by dubbing them "the seven dwarfs".<P>
As the number of primaries grew, however, so did the burden of 
campaigning, for candidates were compelled to take their case to a much 
wider audience. In describing his schedule for just one week of his 1972 
bid for the Presidential nomination, Senator Edmund Muskie testified to 
the frenzied pace of the President-by-primary process: "The previous week 
I'd been down to <A 
HREF="http://www.city.net/countries/united_states/florida/">Florida</A>, 
then I flew to <A HREF="http://www.city.net/countries/united_states/idaho/">Idaho</A>, 
then I flew to <A HREF="http://www.city.net/countries/united_states/california/"> 
California</A>, then I flew back to <A 
HREF="http://www.city.net/countries/united_states/district_of_columbia/">
D.C</A> to vote in the Senate, and I flew back to California, and then I flew into <A 
HREF="http://www.city.net/countries/united_states/new_hampshire/">New Hampshire</A>."<P>
Moreover, it is also important to note that the demands of the 
primary process over the last decades have actually increased because 
circumstances require candidates to prepare for it much earlier. The 
necessity for these early declarations had been occasioned primarily by 
three factors:
<OL>
<LI>the proliferation of primaries
<LI>the increased importance of the early primaries
<LI>the 1974 campaign finance reforms requiring a 
candidate to raise $1,000 in each of twenty states to qualify for partial 
public financing- an undertaking which requires elaborate planning and 
organization<P>
</OL>
The influence of early contests in the delegate selection process 
has also been enhanced by a development not directly related to the 
reforms, namely increased media attention. Critics argue that the system 
gives too much power to the media. They contend that media has replaced 
the party bosses as the new kingsmakers. Deciding who has the momentum at 
any given moment, the press readily labels candidates as winners and 
losers.<P>
Consequently, the states of <A 
HREF="http://www.city.net/countries/united_states/iowa/">Iowa</A> 
and <A HREF="http://www.plymouth.edu/new-hampshire/nh-home.html">New 
Hampshire</A> receive even 
extreme amount of media coverage due to the fact that they are the first 
state caucus and primary respectively. This was encouraged by the Democratic 
party's decision to exempt these two states from complying with the March to 
June time frame for selecting delegates. That these early events can exert 
influence out of proportion to their importance in the greater scheme of 
things is illustrated by the case of New Hampshire. It contains less than 
1 percent of the nation's population but plays an extremely key part in 
who gets the parties nomination. New Hampshire's importance can be 
illustrated by the fact that no one has been elected President since 1952 
without first having won the state's presidential primary. Any election 
result in a state of New Hampshire scarcely justifies elevating a 
candidate to front-runner status, along with the increase in money and 
exposure that typically comes with it.<P>
Many critics maintain that while a nominating process heavily 
laden with primaries gives the appearance of being more democratic than 
the old system, in fact it is not. In the words of Newton Minow:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Presidential primaries were designed to take the nomination away 
from the party bosses in the back room and to give the decisions to the 
voters. But they haven't worked out that way. Instead, the current 
version of primaries turns the decisions over to a new kind of boss. 
Today a small, unrepresentative handful of activists often concerned only 
with one issue or with narrow, special interests, dominate the primaries. 
Because the broad center of moderate and independent voters seldom vote 
in the primaries, the decisions are abdicated to small groups of 
motivated extremists of the left or the right.<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2>Possible Reforms</H2>
Though many believe that some type of reform is needed in the 
selection of presidential nominees, it is not known what type of reform 
would best serve the selection process. One suggestion for reforming the 
nomination process include <B>primary clusterings</B> of one kind or another. 
One such plan calls for grouping primaries by region, with each holding 
its primaries on a given day. This arrangement would:
<UL>
<LI>help to conserve a 
candidate's energy and financial resources, since he would be able to 
focus his attention on one area rather than hopping about the country as 
he must do now
<LI> given the fact that the primary season would 
open with a group of primaries, the potential influence of any one would 
be diluted. Consequently, we would no longer face the problem of a 
candidate being catapulted into the lead by virtue of having won in the 
single state of New Hampshire<P>
</UL>
The major limitation of this proposal, 
however, is that a candidate could be either advantaged or disadvantaged, 
depending on which region goes first.<P>
Others have come out in favor of a reform that would expand public 
participation even beyond what exists under the current system. Known as 
the <B>national primary</B>, it would allow the rank-and-file in each party to 
vote directly for their nominee in a single nationwide election. This 
proposal is attractive for several reasons:
<UL>
<LI>66% of the American people favor it
<LI> since the 
proliferation of primaries in the last decade has brought an increase in 
the number of people participating in the nomination process, a 
nationwide primary could reasonably be expected to swell the ranks still 
further
<LI> such an arrangement would eliminate the disproportionate 
impact of the early primaries
<LI> although Presidential candidates 
currently face their first contest in February, under this proposal the 
election would not come before May or June. This would alleviate the need 
for candidates to begin their campaign a year or more prior to election 
year as they do now<P>
</UL>
But there are many disadvantages to this type of election process as well: 
<UL>
<LI>Certainly for those who think the nominating process is already too 
demanding and expensive, a national primary would merely be making a bad 
situation worse
<LI>since the party leaders and public 
officials would have no formal role in the selection process, this plan 
would deal a further blow to the already diminished position of political 
parties in the American political system
<LI>would place well-known candidates at a distinct disadvantage. Under our current 
system of discrete primaries, Presidential aspirants with limited national 
visibility have an early opportunity to demonstrate their viability as 
candidates. 
They would have no opportunity to do so under a national primary because it 
is a one-shot affair
<LI>face the problem of what to do in the event that no candidate receives a 
majority of the vote<P>
</UL>
There appear to be many flaws with the way we go about choosing the 
Democratic and Republican Party presidential nominees. As author Emmett H. Buell 
stated, the "Decomposition of the party system in recent years has made our 
ongoing quest for national leadership and accountability 
through our unique formula of presidential government more difficult. A 
good first step toward arresting this ominous trend would be to repair 
the flaws in the unfortunate nominating system that we stumbled into 
after the disasters of 1968."<P>
