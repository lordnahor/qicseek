    You must <span style="text-decoration: underline;">type</span> your
    lab assignments and submit them through the EEE Dropbox tool. A
    dropbox will be set up for each of the four lab assignments. This
    lab assignment is due Wednesday, Oct. 16 by 5pm. You must include
    all relevant R code used to answer the questions.<br>

              <h3><b>The Classic Hat Problem</b></h3>
            </div>
            <p>Suppose <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>
              people go to a fancy restaurant. Each person is wearing a
              hat and checks his/her hat at the door as he/she arrives.
              The hat-check attendant gets tipsy throughout the evening,
              forgetting which hat belongs to whom, and returns a random
              hat to each person as they leave. The patrons leave in a
              random order. </p>
            <p> Conduct a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">simulation</span>
              in R to answer the following questions:</p>
            <ol start="1" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
              <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                <li>Assume <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> =
                  5. Calculate an empirical probability that no one gets
                  his or her own hat back. Use this to also estimate the
                  probability that <i>at least one</i> patron gets his
                  or her own hat back.<br>
                </li>
                <li>Still assuming <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>
                  = 5, calculate the empirical mean (average) number of
                  patrons who get their own hats back.</li>
                <li>Repeat parts a. and b. using <span
                    style="font-style: italic;">n</span> = 20.<br>
                </li>
                <li>How do you think the probability of at least one
                  match will change if there are 50 people? How do you
                  think the average number of matches will change with
                  50 people? Test your guesses by repeating the
                  simulation with 50 hats and people. <br>
                </li>
                <li>Try the simulation for larger and larger values of <span
                    style="font-style: italic;">n</span> to get an
                  estimate of the limits for the probability of no one
                  getting his/her hat back <span
                    style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> for
                  the average number of patrons who get their hats back.
                  (We will derive the exact probability of no one
                  getting his/her hat back in class, <span
                    style="font-family: monospace;">exp(-1)</span>. You
                  can check your simulation by checking if your
                  simulated answer is close to the exact answer.)<span
                    style="font-weight: bold;"></span></li>
              </ol>
            </ol>
            <h3>Hints </h3>
            <p> You will need to simulate returning the hats at random
              many many times (1000 times or more), keeping track of how
              many patrons got their hat back on each trial. Try to
              write R code to perform the following steps:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Set up an <span style="font-style: italic;">empty
                  vector</span> to store the result of each trial (in
                the end, this will be a vector of non-negative integers
                representing the number of patrons who got their hat
                back on each trial).</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>Within a <span style="font-style: italic;">for loop</span>,
                for each trial generate <span style="font-style:
                  italic;">two random permutations</span> of size <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">n</span> (the <span
                  style="font-family: monospace;">sample</span> function
                will come in handy here). One represents the random
                order in which the patrons leave, the other the random
                order in which the hats are returned. (Teaser: if the
                hats are returned in random order, does it matter in
                which order the patrons leave?). </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>Compute the <span style="font-style: italic;">number
                  of matches</span> and <span style="font-style:
                  italic;">save</span> it in the vector created in step
                1. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once the for loop runs, you can calculate the <span
                style="font-style: italic;">proportion</span> of times
              that the number of matches was greater than zero, and the
              <span style="font-style: italic;">mean</span> number of
              matches over all trials. Run your simulation several times
              to get an idea of how variable your results are.<br>
