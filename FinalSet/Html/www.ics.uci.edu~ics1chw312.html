Three neat Web finds:
<ol>
<li><A 
HREF="http://www.sony.com/Music/ArtistInfo/MariahCarey.html"><B>Mariah 
Carey</B></a> is one of my favorite singers. She produced three albums 
and one Christmas alubum so far. Her voice is so powerful and 
soulful.  It is said that the range of her voice is seven octaves.  
My favorite CD of hers is MTV unplugged. A variety of her songs is in 
it,  and well-made.                                                   
<li><A HREF="http://www.rain.org/~hutch/sushi.html"><B>Sushi</B></a> is one 
of Japanese traditional dishes, and very tasty. We, Japanese usually 
eat sushi for some occasions. Sushi is kind of expensive, but if you 
like raw fish, you'll love it. If you are not sure, just try it. 
There is one kind of sushi called Californian Roll which you can only 
taste in the States. 
<li>I like <A 
HREF="http://www.btg.com/~cknudsen/xmcd/cgi-bin/cddisplay?soundtrack/dd0c5e10"><B>Les 
Mis Erables</B></a> in general. I read 
its book, watched its movie, and finally I saw its musical at the Broadway in N.Y. The musical was so great. One of the good things about

 it was its songs. They sang so well!!

<LI><A NAME="QQ1"><H2>What is URL?</H2></A>
URL is a <B>Uniform Resource Locator</B> where you can find the information on 
the Internet. URL includes a scheme which is the way to retrieve the 
information, a host where the information is located, and a path which 
leads you to the particular location of the information. The point is 
that you can get the information not only from a particular computer 
but also from any kind of computer on the network. It can also include 
queries which you will get the answers from it.

<LI><A NAME="QQ2"><H2>What is HTML?</H2></A>
HTML is a <B>Hyper Text Markup Language</B> which defines the structure of 
the documents in order to make the documents readable on any computers. So 
you don't need to create a separate version of the documents, and it 
makes you easy to access the resources. However, to make the documents 
into HTML format, you have to follow certain rules. First of all, you 
have to use tags and entities to create HTML format. HTML format basically 
consists of HEAD and BODY 
elements.

<LI><A NAME="QQ3"><H2>Where is the good place to find Japanese culture in 
Japan?</H2></A>
There are many places where you can find Japanese culture in Japan. The 
most famous spot, however, is a city called <A 
HREF="http://www.ntt.jp/japan/JNTO/Kyoto/s6.html"><B>Kyoto</B></a>.                                                    
Kyoto was a Japan's old capital from 794 till 1192. A lot of Japanese 
culture flourished in Kyoto during that era which is <A 
HREF="http://www.io.com/user/nishio/japan/history.html#heian"><B>Heian 
Era</B></a>. You can find more than 1600 Buddhist temples and 270 Shinto 
shurines which represent Japan's major religions. Kyoto is very beautiful in spring, fall, and 
winter, but you might want to avoid summer unles you can stand humidity 
in Kyoto.                                                               
<p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ4"><H2>How is the life in Indonesia different from 
us?</H2></A> 
First of all, in <A 
HREF="http://www.umanitoba.ca/indonesian/travel.html"><B>Indonesia</B></a>
most of the people, especially women wear the clothes called sarong. This 
is a whole big piece of cloth which they just wrap around their waist. 
The majotiry of the people in Indonesia is <A 
HREF="http://www.biologie.uni-freiburg.de/~amueller/religion/islam.html"><B>Moslem</B></a>,                       
and when they go to temple, they usually wear Sarong, and they are not 
allowed to expose their skin. In some area they often use bike taxies as 
a means of transportation. Even though their life is influenced by 
Western culture gradually, they still keep their traditional culture in 
Indonesia.                                                              
<p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ5"><H2>How can you enjoy music, mystery, and 
biography all together?</H2></A>
The answer is <A 
HREF="http://www.msstate.edu/M/title-exact?31E87"><B>Amadeus</B></a>.
This is a movie about a incredible composer, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. 
This movie is led by a flashback of Antonio Salieri who is jealous of a 
talent of Mozart.  It is said that the death of Mozart is a kind of 
mystery, and has something to do with Salieri. Since this movie is all 
about <A 
HREF="http://www.btg.com/~cknudsen/xmcd/cgi-bin/cddisplay?classical/830e5909"><B>Mozart</B></a>,
there is a lot of classical music included in it, and that is 
well-organized. Thus, you can enjoy his biography, a mystery, and music 
all together at one time.
