<b> Project 4: Contributions of Africans,  to American Society    



<p> Throughout time there has been many influential African-American
people and<b> Rosa Parks</b> is one of them. Rosa maiden name was Rosa Loise
McCauley. She was born in Tuskegee, Alabama on February 4, 1913.</p> <p>
Growing up Rosa went through a lot of trials and tribulations.  Her father
moved out on her when she was two years old and left her, her mother
Leona, and her brother Sylvester to move in with her grandparents.  Her
grandparents and her mother were all in bad health so Rosa took over the
motherly chores such as the cooking, cleaning, shopping, and sewing.  At
age 11 Rosa went to live with her aunt in Montgomery, where she enrolled
in the Montgomery Industrial School for Girls. They didn't have enough
money to pay for tuition so Rosa cleaned the classrooms after school to
compensate for the inadequate funds.</p> <p> In 1943 Rosa joined the NAACP
where she helped register black voters. She was always into the upbringing
of African-Americans because she encouraged other blacks to get involved
in the Civil Rights Movement and this was quite evident from what happened
to her in 1955 on a Montgomery bus.  She was riding on the bus when it
came to a stop and a white man came on the bus. While sitting in her seat
and minding her on business, the white man tells her to get out of her
seat and move to the back of the bus.  Rosa said "No" of course but it
didn't stop there. The bus driver also told her to get out of her seat but
she still didn't move and the bus driver threatned to call the authorities,
but nothing changed.  The police later came and arrested Rosa. She had to
go to court and she eventually paid $14 to be let go on trial. Rosa got
together a black congregation and they started to boycott against the
Montgomery buses.  The boycott lasted for 361 days and the buses were
eventually desegrgated.<a

A man
by the name of <b>Martin Luther King, Jr</b>. who was also a civil rights
participant during this era. Martin Luther King Jr, was running a campaign
of peace in instances such as this. He wanted us to conduct our struggle on
the highest plane of dignity and discipline. He didn't want us to meet
physical force with physical force but with soul force. His belief was
that two wrongs don't make a right and we as black people in a white world
had to be above the rest.</p> <p> In 1963 Martin Luther King gave his
famous <i>"I Have A Dream"</i> speech from the steps of the Lincoln
Memorial. This speech was very inspirational and it gave black people hope
for good things to come. In this speech he made analogies of
African-Americans getting written a bad check. "America has given the
Negro people a bad check--- a check which has come back marked
"insufficient funds." But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is
bankrupt." This is a very intriguing statement. He is saying that America
has no hope and faith in black people, but we keep trying to prove them
wrong. Some people might say that we were stupid for trying to prove them
wrong but thought all of these mishaps we kept trying to move forward.
While taking a class at UCI titled "The Psychology of a Black Man", the
professor Thomas Parham once said to me that"African-American people
believe in collective survival."  At first I couldn't understand what that
meant but the more I thought about it, the more sense it made. He was
saying that as a nationality we are not selfish people. We don't believe in
one person so call"making it."  If we make it, we make it together as a
nation. He wants to "lift our nation from the quicksands of racial
injustice to solid rock of brotherhood."<a

<p><b>Thurgood Marshall</b> (1908-1993) is probably most noted for his 
work in 
the civil rights movement.  He was the first African American to serve on 
the supreme court.  Marshall served on the supreme court bench for 24 years 
and would have continued if his health would have permitted.</p>
<p>Before Marshall was appointed to the Supreme Court he worked hard in 
the legal field as an attorney and led a very interesting life.  In the 
year 1930 Marshall graduated from Lincoln University (Cum Laude) and 
three years later in 1933,  he earned his law degree from Harvard 
University.  From  1940 to 1961 Marshall served as legal director for 
thee NAACP,  along side Charles Hamilton (the first African American to 
win a case before the Supreme Court) designed long term goals to end the 
injustice of segregation in America.  Marshall gained world wide 
attention and fame by arguing and winning the landmark court case of 
Brown v. Board of Education.  The outcome of this particular case was it 
made the segregation of schools in America illegal.</p>
<p>The road to the Supreme Court Justice seat was a long and bumpy one to 
say the least.  At the time he was nominated America was still a blatant 
racist country and the black man was looked down upon.  Nominated by 
Lyndon Johnson in 1967, it took a lot of time to get the nomination push 
through.  
Before finally succeding Tom Clark,  Marshall had already argued 32 cases 
and winning 29 of them.</p>
<p>Thurgood Marshall was and still is an exceptional man.  He got into 
the system to overcome the system.  He worked for African Americans all 
the way until his recent death on Jan 24, 1993.  Thurgood Marshall can 
truly be said to be one of the many forefathers of the civil rights 
movement.</p>

<p><b>George Washington Carver</b> (1864-1943) was born a slave in 
Mississippi.  Carver earned his high school Diploma after the Civil War 
working as a farm hand.  He put his way through Iowa Agriculture college 
by assuming the duties of the school janitor.  Shortly after graduating 
from Iowa Agriculturer college,  Carver received his Masters degree from 
the same institution.  With all of his work being monitored he was 
quickly given a position on the faculty.  After a brief stint at Iowa, 
Carver left to join Booker T. Washington at Tuskegee Institute.</p>

<P>Carver was and is still world renowed for his achievements in the 
field of agriculture.  He taught sharecroppers and farmers how to grow, 
preserve and maximize their yield in rotating crops.  In 1914 Carver 
influenced southern congressman to move to other crops besides cotton 
crops that were being threatned by the  "boll weevil" thus 
revolutionized southern agriculture.  Carver developed processes for 
manufacturing  paper, ink, shaving cream, lindeum, syntheic rubber, 
plastics, bleach, metal polish and over 300 consumer and industrial 
products from the peanut and sweet potato. In the following you will have 
the opportunity to view a partial list of some of the inventions by some 
of the African Americans.</p>

<p>Carver was sought throughout the world.  Carver was sought out by 
people from Joseph Stalin to Mahatma Ghandi.  Stalin sought Carvers 
opinion to help exploit the fertility of the huge mass of the former 
USSR.  Stalin wanted to maximize the full output of the area and Carver 
had that sort of knowledge to maximize the areas potential output.  
Ghandi asked Carver to help build and maintain his countries agricutural 
system.  In a effort to contribute to Africas need, Carver developed a 
peanut milk. The peanut milk is a nutricious alternative to the 
traditional cow's milk. By developing an alternative to cow's milk, 
Carver helped save the lives of hundred of babies in west Africa.</p>

<P>It is interesting that while at Tuskegee,  Carver never took out a 
patent on any of his inventions.  Carver was offered huge salaries to 
work for Thomas Edison and Henry Ford but choose instead to work for 
the improvement of the quality of life for the disinfranchished.  Carver 
was a self-less person and only wanted the people to better off.</p>

<P><B>Paul Cauffee</b> (1759-1817) was a Quaker ship-owner with roots 
traced back to African American and Native American Ancestry.  Cauffee 
was an intense man that advocated getting free slaves back to Africa 
and helping them settle down.  Cauffee was a smuggler of people back to 
their native land.  Cauffe intended to make one trip per year at his own 
expense, taking the freed slaves to Africa and returning with cargo.  
He took thirty eight freed slaves  to Freetown, Sierra Leone, but due 
to his untimely death in 1817 the freedom missions ceased.</p>

<P>Cauffee was also a good business man; you might even say he was a 
philanthropist. With the freedom missions came great expense, and Cauffee 
did pay for everything himself.  What he did not pay for himself British 
contributed.  With the British involvement he felt by them helping they 
were contributing to the regeneration of Africa.  Cauffees' greatest 
accomplishment might have been gaining the right for African Americans to 
vote in the state of Massachuttes in 1783.</p>

 <p>These are just some of the brilliant African Americans who have made 
contributions to not only  American society but to the world.  Every culture 
has members who should be recognied and in this essay we try to do just 
that. Each of these people featured in this essay are held in a special 
respect and we do give thanks for all of their accomplishments.  For they 
have paved the way to make it a little bit easier for us today.
