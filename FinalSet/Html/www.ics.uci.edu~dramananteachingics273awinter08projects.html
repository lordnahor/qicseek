To re-iterate, the presentation should be 5 minutes max. Assuming 2 minutes for questions and 2 minutes for laptop switching, this brings us to 9-10 minutes per project.

<h2>Summary</h2>

    The class project is meant to be a opportunity to explore a specific machine learning concept in depth, or an application-driven project focused on a particular real-world dataset. A typical project might be applying a technique from a research paper on one of the datasets linked to below.
    The choice of projects can be very open-ended; ideally you can incorporate their own research. But your class project must be about new things you
have done this semester; you can't use results you have developed in previous semesters.  People can work individually or in teams of two.<br>



<hr>
<h2>Project grading</h2> Recall the project is worth half the class grade.<br>

A project proposal is due on March 3rd. This is worth 10% of the project grade. The proposal should include a title, a pointer to the dataset, roughly 2 paragraphs describing the project idea, and a list of 1-3 relevant papers.

You must prepare a writeup in the format of a <a href="http://leon.bottou.com/nips/">NIPS paper</a> (8 pages maximum in <a href="http://leon.bottou.com/nips/">NIPS format</a>, including references; this page limit is strict), due <b>March 21rst at 1pm</b> in the "Final Projects" folder in the dropbox. The writeup is worth 60% of the project grade. A single writeup is required per project.

You will also be responsible for a 5 minute project presentation, also on March 21rst. This will count toward 30% of the project grade.

<h2> Project ideas </h2>
Again, you are strongly encouraged to find a project aligned with their own research interests. But if you are looking for inspiration, there are numerous similar courses out there, with a plethora of interesting projects!<br>

<h2> Research paper references </h2>
Good places to look for papers:<br>
These include the major machine learning conferences such as <a href = "http://www.nips.cc/">NIPS</a> and ICML. Vision papers that also have a large learning component can be found in ICCV and CVPR. Relevant journals include <br><a href="http://www.jmlr.org/">Journal of ML Research</a> | <a href="http://www.digimine.com/usama/datamine/">Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery</a> | <a href="http://www.jair.org/">Journal of AI Research</a> | <a href = "http://www.computer.org/portal/site/transactions/menuitem.a66ec5ba52117764cfe79d108bcd45f3/index.jsp?&pName=tpami_home/&"> IEEE Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence</a>. <br>
