<LI> Evaluate and compare two uniform scalar quantizers for encoding
     a source ranging over the values in the range (-4.0, +4.0).
     The first is a midrise quantizer defining 8 equal sized intervals.
     The second is a midtread quantizer defining 7 equal sized intervals.
   <P>
     Analyze their expected error, mean square error, and entropy.
     Do this for each of the following two distributions.
   <UL>
   <LI>
     The first distribution has source values uniform over the full range.
   <LI>
     The second distribution has half the values uniform over the full
     range and the other half expected to be at 0+&epsilon;,
     where &epsilon; is a very small positive value.
   </UL>

<LI> Write programs to produce histograms of
     pixel values (range [0,255]), and
     pixel-to-pixel differences (range [-255,+255]).
     Use these programs to determine the histograms for
     images sinan.img and earth.img (located in directory
     http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/class/267/datasets/images/ )
     Note that histograms for the Sinan image are in Sayood's book
     (Figures 10.2 and 10.3).
     Which image would you expect to compress better using
     simple delta modulation?  Explain why.

<LI> Let &nbsp;<I>f</I>(<I>x</I>) be a density which is
     everywhere positive on the interval [<I>a,b</I>].&nbsp;
     Let <I>D<sub>N</sub></I> be the minimum distortion among all
     <I>N</I>-level quantizers for <I>f</I>(<I>x</I>).&nbsp;
     It is known that there is a positive constant <I>C<sub>f</sub></I>
     such that
     lim<sub><I>N</I>&rarr;&infin;</sub>(<I>N</I><sup>2</sup><I>D<sub>N</sub></I>&nbsp;)
     = <I>C<sub>f</sub></I>&nbsp;.&nbsp;
     Suppose we measure <I>D<sub>N</sub></I>&nbsp; in decibels:
     <center>
       [<I>D<sub>N</sub></I>&nbsp;]<sub><I>dB</I></sub> = 10 log<sub>10</sub>
                  [&sigma;<sup>2</sup> / <I>D<sub>N</sub></I>&nbsp;]
     </center>
     What is the approximate difference
       [<I>D<sub>2N</sub></I>&nbsp;]<sub><I>dB</I></sub> -
       [<I>D<sub>N</sub></I>&nbsp;]<sub><I>dB</I></sub>
     for large <I>N</I>?&nbsp;
     Interpret this result.

<LI> Let &nbsp;<I>f</I>(<I>x</I>) be the density

<I>f</I>(<I>x</I>) = 2<I>x</I>, 0 &le; <I>x</I> &le; 1

  <LI> Find the exact values for the two quantization interval endpoints
       <I>y</I><sub>1</sub> and <I>y</I><sub>2</sub> for the optimum
       3-level quantizer for the density <I>f</I>(<I>x</I>).&nbsp;
       (Hint: <I>y</I><sub>1</sub>/<I>y</I><sub>2</sub> = (&radic;5 - 1)/2. )
  <LI> Find the exact values for the three quantization levels
       <I>L</I><sub>1</sub>, <I>L</I><sub>2</sub>, <I>L</I><sub>3</sub>
       for the optimum 3-level quantizer.

<LI> A large image is partitioned into 4&times;4 blocks.
     Assume that the image is a 6 bit per pixel image,
     meaning that the pixel values are in [0,63].
     Suppose that one of the blocks is
<center>
<pre>
20 37 49 60
11 20 36 57
26 39 35 45
 0 22 27 42
</pre>
</center>
The block truncation coding scheme is used on this block.
  <OL type=a>
  <LI> Compute the two quantization levels and the
       4&times;4 binary matrix that are transmitted to the decoder.
  <LI> Determine the 4&times;4 block that is reconstructed by the decoder.
  <LI> Determine the compression rate in bits/pixel.
  <LI> Compute the SQNR in decibels resulting from the block truncation
       coding of the particular block above.
  </OL>
<P>
<LI> In an eight bit per pixel image,
   a variable-rate quantization scheme is used in which
   half of the pixels are fixed-rate scalar quantized
   at a rate of two bits per pixel, and the remaining half of the pixels
   are fixed-rate scalar quantized at a rate of three bits per pixel.
   Compute the optimum SQNR that results from such a lossy compression system.
   Model each pixel value as being continuously and uniformly
   distributed over the interval [0,255].
   (Of course, the pixel values are really integers,
    but the calculations will be much easier and you will make
    very little error by assuming them to be continuously distributed.)

<LI> [Sayood Chapter 13 problem #1 on page 421]
     Prove that use of an orthogonal transformation matrix
     maintains distance invariance.
