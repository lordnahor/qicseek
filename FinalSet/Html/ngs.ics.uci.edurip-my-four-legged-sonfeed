		<description><![CDATA[I feel sorry for what happened to your precious dog. I have dogs at home too. And I love them just the way you love your dog. The thing is, I&#039;m also afraid of them leaving me in the future. They are one of the most precious creature ever made by God. Thank you for your share. Hoping you&#039;re okay now.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ramesh,

Sorry to hear about Osito.  You are blessed to have  received 16 years of unconditional (Ok, other than food and the occasional belly rub) love and joy from Osito. 
I have 2 Labrador  and an American Eskimo (swooped off the streets :))  so I know your feelings. 

Regards
