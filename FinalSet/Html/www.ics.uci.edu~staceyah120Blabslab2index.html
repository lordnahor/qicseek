    In this lab, you will be introduced to the concept of <i><b>sampling

        distributions</b></i>, which we will study in Chapter 8 of our
    textbook. A sampling distribution is just a probability distribution
    of a statistic. We have already investigated sampling distributions
    of some statistics, such as the sample mean, just without calling
    them by name.<br>
    <h2>Sampling Distribution of the Sample Mean</h2>
    <p>We have shown previously that if <i>X</i><i><sub>1</sub></i><i>,
        X</i><i><sub>2</sub></i><i>,..., X</i><i><sub>n</sub></i> are
      independent and identically distributed random variables with
      mean&nbsp;<img alt="" src="Lab2image2.png" width="17" height="17">
      and variance<img alt="" src="Lab2image1.png" width="23"
        height="18">, then the <i><b>sampling distribution of the
          sample mean</b></i> is also normal with mean&nbsp;<img alt=""
        src="Lab2image2.png" width="17" height="17"> and variance <img
        alt="" src="Lab2image3.png" width="41" height="18">. (Remind
      yourself how we proved this!) That is,<br>
    </p>
    <div align="center"><img alt="" src="Lab2image4.png" width="125"
        height="65"><br>
      <div align="left">Standardizing, we can write this result as<br>

        <br>
        Let's try simulating from this distribution and see if we can
        match the theoretical result. Work through the following R code
        and make sure you understand what each line of code is doing.
        What values in the code correspond to the sample size,
        population mean, and population variance listed above?<br>
        <pre>means = NULL<br>stdmeans = NULL<br>for(i in 1:10000){<br>	samp = rnorm(35, 15, 2)<br>	means[i] = mean(samp)<br>	stdmeans[i] = (mean(samp) - 15)/(2/sqrt(35))<br>}<br><br>mean(means)<br>mean(stdmeans)<br><br>sd(means)<br>sd(stdmeans)<br><br>par(mfrow=c(1,2)) # Set up plot window to do one row of two plots.<br>hist(means, xlab = "Sample Means (n = 35)", freq=F)<br>lines(density(means))<br>curve(dnorm(x, 15, 2/sqrt(35)),add=T,lty=2)<br>hist(stdmeans, xlab = "Standardized Sample Means (n = 35)", freq=F)<br>lines(density(stdmeans))<br>curve(dnorm(x),add=T)<br><br></pre>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h2>Sampling Distributions of Other Statistics<br>
    </h2>
    It is easy to simulate sampling distributions of other statistics as
    well. A simulated sampling distribution is called an <i><b>empirical
        sampling distribution</b></i>. For example, let's try simulating
    the distribution of the sample variance:<br>
    <div align="center"><img alt="" src="Lab2image6.png" width="174"
        height="52"><br>
    </div>
    still assuming we're sampling from the same normal distribution as
    above:<br>
    <pre>vars = NULL<br>for(i in 1:10000){<br>	samp = rnorm(35, 15, 2)<br>	vars[i] = var(samp)<br>}<br><br>mean(vars)<br>sd(vars)<br><br>hist(vars, xlab = "Sample Variances (n = 35)", freq=F)<br>lines(density(vars))<br></pre>
    Does the probability distribution of the sample variance look
    normal? What probability distribution does it look like?<br>
    <br>
    Let's consider a more involved statistic. We know that the
    standardized mean has a standard normal distribution when sampling
    from a normal distribution. But what if we were to substitute the
    sample variance for the population variance? In other words, what if
    we were to look at the statistic<br>
    <br>
    <div align="center"><img alt="" src="Lab2image8.png" width="91"
        height="57"><br>
      <br>
      <div align="left">Before running the simulation, what do you think
        the sampling distribution of <i>T</i> will look like?... Ok,
        let's try it:<br>
        <pre>ts = NULL<br>for(i in 1:10000){<br>	samp = rnorm(35, 15, 2)<br>	ts[i] = (mean(samp) - 15)/(sd(samp)/sqrt(35))<br>}<br><br>mean(ts)<br>sd(ts)<br><br>hist(ts, xlab = "T-statistics (n = 35)", freq=F)<br>lines(density(ts))<br>curve(dnorm(x),add=T,lty=2)<br></pre>
        Compare your histogram of simulated T-statistics to the standard
        normal curve. Do the two distributions seem close? What about
        simulated probabilities? Let's see...<br>
        <pre>mean( ts &lt; (-2) ) # Estimated probability that T &lt; -2 (why?)<br># Compare to:<br>pnorm(-2)<br></pre>
        What if we were to try a different sample size? Re-run the
        simulation above, but using <i>n</i> = 5 rather than <i>n</i>
        = 35. What changed?<br>
