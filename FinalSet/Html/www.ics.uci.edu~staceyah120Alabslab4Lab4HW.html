    You must <span style="text-decoration: underline;">type</span> your
    lab assignments and submit them through the EEE Dropbox tool. A
    dropbox will be set up for each of the four lab assignments. This
    lab assignment is due Wednesday, Nov. 27 by 5pm. You must include
    all relevant R code used to answer the questions.<br>

        <tr>
          <td style="vertical-align: top;">Use the "Life97" life table
            used on the previous page to answer the following three
            questions.<br>
            <ol>
              <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;

              <li>
                Compute the life expectancy (mean length of life) based
                on the Life97 tables for
                both males and females. Use the age midpoints:&nbsp;
                <pre>age &lt;- (1:119)-1/2</pre>
              </li>
              <li>Find the <i>median</i> length of life for both males
                and females and compare the mean length of life
                to the median length of life. <i> Hint</i>: you can
                figure out the
                median by examination of the original life table! </li>
              <li>
                What proportion of each sex survives past age 20? age
                50? age 80? <br>
              </li>
              <li>Compute the conditional life expectancy for both
                males and females, given survival to age 20, age 50, and
                age 80. <br>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Life expectation varies from group to group. For a
              dramatically different population, load the life tables
              for Afghanistan over the same time period using the R
              command:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <pre>AfghanLife &lt;- read.table("http://people.reed.edu/~jones/141/Afghan.dat", header=TRUE)
</pre>
            </blockquote>
            This table is much
            less detailed, with age of death in 5 year increments. Use
            this table to answer the following question.<br>
            <ol start="5">
              <li>
                Compute the life expectancy based on the AfghanLife
                tables for both males and females. Also compute the
                conditional life
                expectancy at ages 20, 50, and 80
                for both males and females. Compare these values with
                the corresponding U.S. values.
                <p> <b>Note:</b>
                  To estimate life expectancy
                  you will need to impute an age of death for each
                  interval.
                  The label for each interval is its upper endpoint, so
                  the
                  interval labeled "1" corresponds to deaths in the
                  interval
                  from 0 to 1, the interval labeled "5" to deaths in the
                  interval
                  from 1 to 5 years, etc. You will need to create an age
                  vector corresponding to the midpoints of these
                  intervals.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li> A few years ago a <i>New York Times</i> article
                reported that 37
                well known male symphony directors had an average life
                span about 5
                years greater than the average for US males. Speculation
                revolved
                around life-style differences (symphony directors wave
                their arms
                about while directing, that must be good exercise!) and
                possible
                genetic explanations. Is there a simple statistical
                explanation
                connected to conditional expectation? Explain.
