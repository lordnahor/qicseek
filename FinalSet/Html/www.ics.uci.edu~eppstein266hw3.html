<OL>
<LI><B>Plane sweep</B>.  Suppose you are given a collection of circles
in the plane,
none of which cross each other.  Describe an algorithm for testing
whether there is any pair of circles, one of which contains the other.
What is the running time of your algorithm?
<P>
<LI><B>Davenport-Schinzel Sequences</B>.  Any two ellipses can have at
most four crossing points.  What does this imply about the complexity of
a lower envelope of <I>n</I> ellipses?  How quickly can one compute such
a lower envelope?
<P>
<LI><B>Ham-Sandwich Trees</B>.  A Ham-Sandwich tree in the plane
works by cutting the point sets corresponding to the two children of any
node by a common line; the result is that any halfplane boundary can
only cross three out of the four grandchildren, so this data structure
gives fast halfspace range queries.  More explicitly,
if we let T(<I>n</I>) denote the query time on this data structure,
and S(<I>n</I>) denote time to query a node for which one of its
two children is missed by the query boundary,
we have a recurrence
<BLOCKQUOTE>
T(<I>n</I>) = T(<I>n/2</I>) + S(<I>n/2</I>) + O(1)<BR>
S(<I>n</I>) = T(<I>n/2</I>) + O(1)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
which has a solution involving the Fibonacci numbers.
<P>
In three dimensions, we would like to perform an analogous construction,
in which we cut the point sets corresponding to the four grandchildren
of any node by a common plane.
<P>
(a) If this were possible, what would this imply about halfspace range queries?
Write out a recurrence for the query time and solve it.
<P>
(b) Show that it is not possible i.e. find four point sets that can not
be evenly cut by a single plane.
