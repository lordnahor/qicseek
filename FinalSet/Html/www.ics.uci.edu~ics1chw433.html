<H2><A NAME="Abstract">ABSTRACT</A></H1>
Science and technological advancements made today appear or are begotten
at an explosively increasing rate.  The rate at which new technology develops 
now is 
highest in history.  The modern computer and telecommunications infrastructure
produced and gained from this increased rate has also afforded us with 
the revolutionary speed in which we hear and adopt the new technology.
This all has indeed been affecting society in tremendously different ways---jobs
have arisen, growth and relay of information efficiently increased,
and increased national gross to name a few ways. 
<p>
However the ability and potential to take advantage of our cutting edge
technology rests not on how much of the new knowledge or technology we
can produce but on society's ability and capacity to accept, absorb, and 
use it.  What this means is that the limits of science and technological 
advancement as well as economic growth may be ascribed to society's ability
to assimilate the new knowledge and transform it into a part of our lives.
<p>
The concern and belief that many within the political, scientific, and economic
arena have regards then the approach that we must also develop new methods
and approaches to broaden the capacity, increase the reasoning, and
offset the limitations of our society.  What follows in this paper is
a discussion of a few areas in which significant efforts have been made as 
so the technology
we have may become more useful and accessible to society. 
<p>
This paper's principle intent is to provide attention to these areas and by no
means an is argument for these areas.  However, it is hoped after seeing the
new perspective, that readers will be swayed over into adopting the belief
for these areas of research otherwise known as Human Computer Interaction or
HCI.

<H2><A NAME="Intro">INTRODUCTION</A></H1>
I begin this discussion first <A HREF="http://www.cs.bgsu.edu/HCI/defn.html">
defining what HCI is</A> or what does it stand for.
Human Computer Interaction is <i>the study of the interaction between
human beings and computers</i> (Booth, An Introduction to Human-Computer 
Interaction, Lawrence Erlbaum, 1989, p.4).  
<p>
In that article where Booth
defines HCI, Booth also details the 5 more definitions of different areas
within HCI:
<dl>
<dt> Research into International Hardware and Software
<dd> Developing, studying and providing guidelines for various ways or
interacting with computers, both at the software and hardware level
<dt> Research into Machine Models
<dd> Study how users interact with computers
<dt> Research at the Task Level
<dd> Determining how well systems meet user's needs
<dt> Research into Design and Development
<dd> Studying designers and design process
<dt> Research into Organizational Impact
<dd> Studying the impact of new systems on organizations, groups,
and individuals
</dl>
The also available <A HREF="http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/people/ematias/faq/contents.html">HCI FAQ</A> references Human Computer Interaction as :
<ul>
<li> "a body of knowledge about human limitations, human abilities, and other
human characteristics that are relevant to design"
<li> "the application of human factors information to the design of tools,
machines, systems, tasks, jobs, and environments for safe, comfortable, and
effective human use"
<li> "a discipline concerned with the design, evaluation and implementation 
of interacting computing systems for human use and with the study of major 
phenomena surrounding them."---<A HREF="http://info.acm.org">ACM</A> 
SIGCHI Curricula for Human-Computer Interaction, 1992, p. 5

<H2><A NAME="Motivation">MOTIVATION</A></H1>
I am interested in the ease of use when it comes to utilizing a computer and
its software tools and hardware devices available.  Often when using
a computer and migrating to another computer to use I must adhere to the 
new environmental constructs, constraints, and conventions  that the 
new machine exists on.
If it is a similar platform, then there may be little adjustments made in
the mode of use; otherwise, the shift in manner of use is wide.  This is
often seen when swapping between a machine with a graphical user interface 
(GUI), such as the <A HREF="gopher://sumex-aim.stanford.edu/11/info-mac">
MacIntosh based machines</A> and ones with a command 
line interfaces, like DOS or Unix based machines as the 
<A HREF="http"//www.intel.com>x86</A> or 
<A HREF="http://www.fh-wolfenbuettel.de/cgi-bin/man2html">Sparc</A> machines.
In these cases, the <A HREF="http://galaxy.einet.net/galaxy/Engineering-and-Technology/Computer-Technology/Operating-Systems.html">operating system</A> is 
primarily responsible for the distinctions.  Personally, I find it a challenge
to learn the new commands of a new platform.  For many others I have seen, it 
becomes a frustrating <i>bang on that dang keyboard and mouse</i> type of
experience.  Yet, at crucial times when I am constrained by time to accomplish
a task, then working on a new or unaccustomed platform degrades terribly the
productivity.  Though there is wide <A HREF="http://www.maths.tcd.ie/scrg/os-faq.html">research over operating systems</A>, the primary concern for me as a
user is its ease of use and learning.

<H2><A NAME="Analysis">ANALYSIS</A></H1>
This section was originally intended to discuss a few of the different areas
(ergonmics, reliability, safety, security, etc)
that HCI is involved in.  This however would be a monumental task to cover
even just a small number of the areas due to the complexity each issue or area.
So I have streamline this document to pertain roughly to user interface issues.
Rather than also present analysis in a textual prose type of approach, I have
also adopted the format of <i>Question/Answer</i> for easier delineation of
the issues within the area of user interfaces.  By no means though, does this
imply that all possible issues covered and discussed.  The objective is to
only present a layman's view of some of the more apparent  or sometimes subtle
tenets
involved in user interfaces. 
<p>

<H2><A NAME="UI">User Interfaces</A></H1>
<i>Does the <A HREF="http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/people/ematias/faq/S/S-9.html">
colors on the screen play a role is ease of use?</A></i><br>
Yes.  People's eyes are sensitive to different colors and different light
intensities.  Research (Taptafaporn and Saito 1990) has shown that 
display polarity and lighting 
conditions may be the causes of some users' eyestrain.  It is recommended
that the degree of both factors be dependent on the working environment and
the individual.  What is not recommended is reading from a monitor with
a dark background, which causes pupil dilation (as in a dark room 
environment) and thus causes the image on the retina to defocus.  The 
research concluded that having a positive polarity display, black letters
on a white background, is physiologically and psychologically superior
to the reverse.
<p>
<i>Why don't developers just produce a comprehensively intense manual that 
provides all the answers? </i><br>
Such a tome would be rather lengthy and often unmanageable for all individuals
to carry about.  In addition, each individual sees and experiences things
in such a diverse manner, that it is nearly impossible to cover all the
questions everyone has.  Another trend is that it may be impractical since
most users tend to not read the manual and refer to it as the last option.
As the <b><A HREF="http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/people/ematias/faq/S/S-11.html">
Golden Rules</A></b> of the order of what to do when a user experiences
difficulty with a system, many users follow this ordered list:
<ol>
<li> Experiment for themselves.
<li> Ask the nearest person.
<li> Ask the office expert.
<li> Phone expert.
<li> Try online help.
<li> Look in the manual.
</ol>

<i><A HREF="http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/people/ematias/faq/S/S-10.html">
What's the big deal over having a modal dialogue box as opposed to a
modeless one?</A></i><br>
Modal ones are used when a user is required to first make the appropriate
response to the dialogue box in order to continue.  In many cases, this 
is not essential or not
intuitive for a user to respond directly with the dialogue box.  Making a
modeless ones is preferred to allow a user to react in his or her own
idiosyncratic way rather than get flustered figuring out what exactly needs
to be done.

<p>
<i> <A HREF="http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/people/ematias/faq/S/S-16.html">
Is there a single easy in-lab way to determine if the operating system
works synchronously in tuned with a user?</A></i><br>
No.  In order to test if it behaves the way a user expects it to behave
is to allow numerous users to use it extensively.  This is also known as 
beta testing.

<i><A HREF="http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/people/ematias/faq/S/S-18.html">
What type of issues are involved when making an icon?  It doesn't seem
like a big deal.</A></i><br>
When crafting icons, association relationships must be highly regarded.
Many assume that the shape of an icon conveys enough meaning; this 
however is not true.  Icons should be tested after creation to check
for weak relationships.  Tests have also shown that icons with names
labeled on them make learning easier.

<H2><A NAME="Conclusions">CONCLUSIONS</A></H1>
There are multiple issues involved in the interactions between humans and
machines.  Whether they be obvious or complex and subtle, when improperly dealt
with, the issues restrain effective and efficient communication between a user
and a machine.  The small subset of issues examined in this document for
just <b>one</b> area, user interfaces, may have seemed anal retentitive or
trivial; but in reality, they are major issues being dealt with and researched
continuously.  Can there be one universal answer to all the issues involved?
Most likely no.  As our society continues to diversify itself in new and
more innovative directions, our issues become more complex and unsolvable.
However, through various approaches we can alleviate the complexity through
HCI research.  HCI research concentrates on three key elements:
<ol>
<li> New interaction paradigms that enable users to communicate with computers
and with others using computers in more effective, human ways;
<li> Fundamental understanding of the nature of interaction that will enable users
to achieve their goals more directly, including a better understanding of the
limitations of human information processing;
<li> <A HREF="http://www.sei.cmu.edu/topics.html">Engineering methods</A>
 for interactive system design and development that
will improve the quality and reduce the costs of user interfaces for
new systems.
</ol>
What we need now is a call for the all the innovators and leaders in
development to adhere them closely.
