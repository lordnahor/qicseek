<H1 align=center>CompSci 165 Course Grading</H1>

<H2>Project Grading</H2>

<UL>
   <LI> There is a checklist of criteria specific for each project.
   <LI> Points are assigned to various aspects and characteristics of
        the submission.
     <BR> ( The total points available is completely arbitrary,
        may vary by project, and it is a mere coincidence if they add to 100. )
   <LI> The sum of the points awarded is the <I>Point Sum</I> for that project.
     <BR> The Point Sum is used as a guideline to help in assigning
        a letter grade for that project submission.
   <LI> The Point Sum is translated into a <I>Grade</I> using a non-linear mapping.
        Generally, the meaning of a <I>Grade</I> is as follows:
        <UL>
          <LI> A  excellent
          <LI> B  quite good
          <LI> C  fair, just adequate
          <LI> D  passing, because the grader was charitable
          <LI> F  failing
          <LI> H  below failing... not a credible effort or nothing submitted
        </UL>
   <LI> Grades A thru D may have an appended + or - modifier.
</UL>

<H2>Course Grading</H2>

<UL>
  <LI> In computing course averages, it is hard dealing with letters.
  <LI> Each project letter <I>Grade</I> is converted into a <I>Mark</I>
       that ranges from 0 to 100, using a linear mapping for A thru D and a non-linear mapping for F and H.
  <LI> Your <I>Course Average</I> is then computed as follows.
       <UL>
         <LI> the worst of your 3 project marks counts 20%
         <LI> the other 2 project marks each count 40%
         <LI> bonus 2% given for submitting course evaluation
       </UL>
  <LI> Your course grade is the Grade closest to your Course Average,
       applying the reverse linear mapping.
</UL>
