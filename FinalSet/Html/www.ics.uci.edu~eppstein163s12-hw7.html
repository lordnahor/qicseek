<h2>CS 163, Spring 2012, Homework 7, due Thursday, May 31</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Draw a graph that has exactly one maximum clique and exactly one clique that is maximal but not maximum.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose we are applying the pivoting version of the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm to the graph shown below.
<ol type="a">
<li>Which vertex would be picked as the pivot in the topmost recursive call to the algorithm?</li>
<li>What recursive calls to the algorithm would be made directly from this topmost call? List the arguments to each of these recursive calls.</li>
</ol>

<li><p>Suppose we are using the same graph shown above as a seed graph for the Barabasi-Albert model. What is the probability that the first edge added by the model connects a new vertex to vertex <i>a</i>?</p></li>

<li><p>What is the clustering coefficient of the graph shown above?</p></li>
