<h1>
Kinetic Data Structures for All Nearest Neighbors and Closest Pair in
the Plane
</h1>
<h2>

<p>
This paper presents a kinetic data structure (KDS) for solutions to
the all nearest neighbors problem and the closest pair problem in the
plane. For a set <i>P</i> of <i>n</i> moving points where the trajectory
of each
point is an algebraic function of constant maximum degree <i>s</i>, our
kinetic algorithm uses <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>) space
and <nobr><i>O</i>(<i>n</i> log <i>n</i>)</nobr> preprocessing
time and processes
<nobr><i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup> &beta;<sub>2<i>s</i> + 2</sub>(<i>n</i>)<sup>2</sup> log <i>n</i>)</nobr>
events in amortized <i>O</i>(log&nbsp;<i>n</i>) time per event, where
&beta;<sub><i>s</i></sub>(<i>n</i>) is an
extremely slow growing function. In terms of the KDS performance
criteria, our KDS is efficient, responsive (in an amortized sense),
compact, and local (on average).
</p><p>
Our deterministic kinetic algorithm improves by
an <i>O</i>(log<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;<i>n</i>)
factor the previous randomized kinetic algorithm by Agarwal, Kaplan,
and Sharir. The improvement is obtained by using a new sparse graph
representation, the Pie Delaunay graph, to reduce the problem to
one-dimensional range searching, as opposed to the two-dimensional
range searching in the previous work. Their KDS is efficient,
responsive (in an amortized sense), and compact, but it is not local.
