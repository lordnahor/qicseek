              <p><b>PREAMBLE</b></p>
              <p>The member States of the Council of Europe, signatory hereto,</p>
              <p>Considering that the aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve
              greater unity between its members, based in particular on respect
              for the rule of law, as well as human rights and fundamental
              freedoms;</p>
              <p>Considering that it is desirable to extend the safeguards for
              everyone's rights and fundamental freedoms, and in particular the
              right to the respect for privacy, taking account of the increasing
              flow across frontiers of personal data undergoing automatic
              processing;</p>
              <p>Reaffirming at the same time their commitment to freedom of
              information regardless of frontiers;</p>
              <p>Recognising that it is necessary to reconcile the fundamental
              values of the respect for privacy and the free flow of information
              between peoples,</p>
              <p>Have agreed as follows:</p>

              <p>Object and Purpose</p>
              <p>The purpose of this convention is to secure in the territory of
              each Party for every individual, whatever his nationality or
              residence, respect for his rights and fundamental freedoms, and in
              particular his right to privacy, with regard to automatic
              processing of personal data relating to him (&quot;data
              protection&quot;).</p>
              <p><b>Article 2</b></p>
              <p>Definitions</p>
              <p>For the purposes of this convention:</p>
              
                
                  <p>a. &quot;personal data&quot; means any information relating

                  subject&quot;);</p>
                  <p>b. &quot;automated data file&quot; means any set of data
                  undergoing automatic processing;</p>
                  <p>c. &quot;automatic processing&quot; includes the following
                  operations if carried out in whole or in part by automated
                  means: storage of data, carrying out of logical and/or
                  arithmetical operations on those data, their alteration,
                  erasure, retrieval or dissemination;</p>
                  <p>d. &quot;controller of the file&quot; means the natural or
                  legal person, public authority, agency or any other body who
                  is competent according to the national law to decide what
                  should be the purpose of the automated data file, which
                  categories of personal data should be stored and which
                  operations should be applied to them.</p>
                
              
              <p><b>Article 3</b></p>

                  <p>1. The Parties undertake to apply this convention to
                  automated personal data files and automatic processing of
                  personal data in the public and private sectors.</p>
                  <p>2. Any State may, at the time of signature or when
                  depositing its instrument of ratification, acceptance,
                  approval or accession, or at any later time, give notice by a
                  declaration addressed to the Secretary General of the Council
                  of Europe:</p>
                  
                    
                      <p>(a) that it will not apply this convention to certain
                      categories of automated personal data files, a list of
                      which will be deposited. In this list it shall not
                      include, however, categories of automated data files
                      subject under its domestic law to data protection
                      provisions. Consequently, it shall amend this list by a
                      new declaration whenever additional categories of
                      automated personal data files are subjected to data
                      protection provisions under its domestic law;</p>
                      <p>(b) that it will also apply this convention to
                      information relating to groups of persons, association,
                      foundations, companies, corporations and any other bodies
                      consisting directly or indirectly of individuals, whether
                      or not such bodies possess legal personality;</p>
                      <p>(c) that it will also apply this convention to personal
                      data files which are not processed automatically.</p>
                    
                  
                  <p>3. Any State which has extended the scope of this
                  convention by any of the declarations provided for in
                  sub-paragraph 2.b or c above may give notice in the said
                  declaration that such extensions shall apply only to certain
                  categories of personal data files, a list of which will be
                  deposited.</p>
                  <p>4. Any Party which has excluded certain categories of
                  automated personal data files by a declaration provided for in
                  sub-paragraph 2.a above may not claim the application of this
                  convention to such categories by a Party which has not
                  excluded them.</p>
                  <p>5. Likewise, a Party which has not made one or other of the
                  extensions provided for in sub-paragraph 2.b or c above may
                  not claim the application of this convention on these points
                  with respect to a Party which has made such extensions.</p>
                  <p>6. The declarations provided for in paragraph 2 above shall
                  take effect from the moment of the entry into force of the
                  convention with regard to the State which has made them if
                  they have been made at the time of signature or deposit of its
                  instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession,
                  or three months after their receipt by the Secretary General
                  of the Council of Europe if they have been made at any later
                  time. These declarations may be withdrawn, in whole or in
                  part, by a notification addressed to the Secretary General of
                  the Council of Europe. Such withdrawals shall take effect
                  three months after the data of receipt of such notification.</p>
              <p><b><u>CHAPTER II-BASIC PRINCIPLES FOR DATA PROTECTION</u></b></p>
              <p><b>Article 4</b></p>
              <p>Duties of the Parties</p>
              
                
                  <p>1. Each Party shall take the necessary measures in its
                  domestic law to give effect to the basic principles for data
                  protection set out in this chapter.</p>
                  <p>2. These measures shall be taken at the latest at the time
                  of entry into force of this convention in respect of that
                  Party.</p>

                      <p>c. adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to
