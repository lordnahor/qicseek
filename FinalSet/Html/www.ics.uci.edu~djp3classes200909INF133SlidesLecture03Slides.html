    <meta name="description" content="User Interaction: The Human Asst. Professor Donald J. Patterson INF 133 Fall 2009  Humans are limited in their capacity to process information. This has important implications for design.  Human Computer Interaction is a misnomer. Rarely do people want to interact with a computer. They want to interact with people, data, media. Even gaming isn’t about the computer as much as it is about having fun through a computer.  Information i/o …visual, auditory, haptic, movementInformation stored in memorysensory, short-term, long-termInformation processed and appliedreasoning, problem solving, skill, errorEmotion influences human capabilitiesEach person is different The Human HCI:Dix,et.al  mechanism for receiving light and transforming it into electrical energylight reflects from objectsimages are focused upside-down on retinaretina contains rods for low light vision and cones for color visionganglion cells (brain!) detect pattern and movement The Human HCI:Dix,et.al The Eye - Physical Reception  Size and depthvisual angle indicates how much of view an object occupies (relates to size and distance from eye)visual acuity is ability to perceive detail (limited)familiar objects perceived as constant size  (in spite of changes in visual angle when far away)cues like overlapping help perception of size and depththumbnail at arms length is equivalent to 640x480 pixels The Human HCI:Dix,et.al The Eye - Interpreting the signal  Brightnesssubjective reaction to levels of lightaffected by luminance of objectmeasured by just noticeable differencevisual acuity increases with luminance as does flickerColormade up of hue, intensity, saturationcones sensitive to color wavelengthsblue acuity is lowest8% males and 1% females color blind The Human HCI:Dix,et.al The Eye - Interpreting the signal  The visual system compensates for:movementchanges in luminance.Context is used to resolve ambiguityOptical illusions sometimes occur due to over compensation The Human HCI:Dix,et.al The Eye - Interpreting the signal  The visual system compensates for:movementchanges in luminance.Context is used to resolve ambiguityOptical illusions sometimes occur due to over compensation The Human HCI:Dix,et.al The Eye - Interpreting the signal  The Human HCI:Dix,et.al The Eye - Interpreting the signalOptical Illusions  The Human HCI:Dix,et.al The Eye - Interpreting the signalOptical Illusions - Chromatic Adaptation  The Human HCI:Dix,et.al The Eye - Interpreting the signalOptical Illusions - Chromatic Adaptation  The Human HCI:Dix,et.al The Eye - Interpreting the signalOptical Illusions - Chromatic Adaptation  There are similar effects for other input and output Hearing Pitch, Loudness, Timbre Frequency and Processing MP3sTouchHeat, Pain, PressureAdaptation Movement Reaction Time, Fidelity The Human HCI:Dix,et.al  Three types of memory which build on each other Sensory Memory Short-Term or Working Memory Long-Term Memory The Human HCI:Dix,et.al Memory  Three types of memory which build on each other Sensory Memory Short-Term or Working Memory Long-Term Memory The Human HCI:Dix,et.al Memory  Buffers for stimuli received through sensesiconic memory: visual stimuliechoic memory: aural stimulihaptic memory: tactile stimuliExamplesnon cognitive recallContinuously overwritten The Human HCI:Dix,et.al Sensory Memory  Scratch-pad for temporary recallrapid access ~ 70msrapid decay ~ 200mslimited capacity - 7± 2 chunks The Human HCI:Dix,et.al Short-Term Memory  Repository for all our knowledgeslow access ~ 1/10 secondslow decay, if anyhuge or unlimited capacityTwo typesepisodic	– serial memory of eventssemantic	– structured memory of facts,concepts, skillssemantic LTM derived from episodic LTM The Human HCI:Dix,et.al Long-Term Memory  Reasoning Deduction Induction Abduction Problem Solving The Human HCI:Dix,et.al Thinking  Reasoning Deduction derive logically necessary conclusion from given premises. Induction generalize from cases seen to cases unseen Abduction reasoning from event to cause Sam drives fast when drunk.If I see Sam driving fast, assume drunk. The Human HCI:Dix,et.al Thinking  Problem Solving Process of finding solution to unfamiliar task using knowledge.Many theories of this process The Human HCI:Dix,et.al Thinking  Emotion influences human capabilities  Various theories of how emotion worksJames-Lange: emotion is our interpretation of a physiological response to a stimuliCannon: emotion is a psychological response to a stimuliSchacter-Singer: emotion is the result of our evaluation of our physiological responses, in the light of the whole situation we are inEmotion clearly involves both cognitive and physical responses to stimuli The Human HCI:Dix,et.al Emotion  The biological response to physical stimuli is called affectAffect influences how we respond to situationspositive → creative problem solvingnegative → narrow thinking The Human HCI:Dix,et.al Emotion  “Negative affect can make it harder to do even easy tasks; positive affect can make it easier to do difficult tasks.”  D.A. Norman, 2002  “Aesthetic-Usability Effect” is a phenomenon aesthetic designs are perceived as more usable are more likely to be used make people more tolerant of problems unaesthetic designs may be more usable, but don’t get used Aesthetic-Usability Effect UPoD:Lidwell et.al. http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/#ad  long term 	–  sex, physical and intellectual abilitiesshort term 	–  effect of stress or fatiguechanging 	–  ageAsk yourself: will design decision exclude section of user population? The Human HCI:Dix,et.al Individuals vary in their abilities  Example Take out a piece of paper  Memorize the photo that is about to appear  From “Flow: Psychology of Optimal Experience” by Csikszentmihalyi The Human: Designing for people  • “Plasticity”	• Adapting to different environments easily. 	• What environments?
