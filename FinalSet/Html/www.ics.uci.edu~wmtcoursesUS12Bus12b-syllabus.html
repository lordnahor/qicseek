<H2>What and Why</H2>
<p>
US 12B is part of UCI's First-Year Integrated Program. This course is the second in the three-part University Studies 12 sequence in the first-year integrated program. The prerequisite for enrollment in this course is successful completion of University Studies 12A.
Throughout the year we'll be investigating computer games as artistic, cultural, and technological phenomena. An important theme of this course is collaboration. All but the simplest computer games are created by more than one person, and when we study a computer game we participate in a dialog of sorts that includes the creators of the game, other players, society at large, and ourselves. We want to promote a collaborative spirit throughout the course, while being cognizant, of course, of the need for each student to master the material individually and to received a grade based on his or her own performance. At the conclusion of US 12ABC, you will be able to:
<ol>
<li>identify the genre of a computer game and place the game
	in an historical context;
<li>understand how computer game technology and techniques
	are used for purposes other than entertainment;
<li>design new computer games based on a variety of themes, patterns,
	and genres;
<li>implement simple code, art, and sound/music within a computer
	game.
</ol>
</p>
<p>
This course is the second in the three-part University Studies 12 sequence. The prerequisite for enrollment in this course is successful completion of University Studies 12A. Because US 12ABC satisfies part of your lower-division writing requirement, in each quarter you will be writing research-based, college-level papers.  You will learn to:
<ol>
<li>summarize an argument made by another writer;
<li>respond logically to texts;
<li>construct a thesis supported by sophisticated claims;
<li>provide sufficient evidence to support such claims;
<li>convey your thesis and opinions in fluent, well-organized
	sentences and paragraphs.
</ol>
</p>

<h2>Assignments and Grading</h2>

<p>
The grade for the quarter will be determined based on your total points.
Points are allotted as follows:
</p>

<p>
<table border cellpadding="2">
<tr><td>Essay		<td align="right"> 20 (5 for draft, 15 for final)
<tr><td>Game		<td align="right"> 20 (5 for draft, 15 for final)
<tr><td>Labs			<td align="right"> 15
<tr><td>Discussions		<td align="right"> 15
<tr><td>Midterm		<td align="right"> 10
<tr><td>Final		<td align="right"> 20
<tr><td>TOTAL			<td align="right"> 100
</table>
</p>

<p>
The grade will be based on the total points, using a standard
"straight" scale: 90's are As, 80's are Bs, 70s are Cs, 60s are Ds,
and below 60 is Failing.
We reserve the right to change the precise cut-off points.
</p>

<p>
Except for the Labs and Discussion components,
scores are based on the quality of the work turned in, not
on the time spent or the effort expended.
Also, note that there is no "extra credit" in US 12B.
</p>

<h2>Textbooks and Resources</h2>

<p>
For the writing portion of the class, you should have
two books which are also assigned in Writing 39B:
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Writing From A to Z</i>, fifth edition, by Ebest, Alred, Brusaw, and Oliu.
<li><i>A Student Guide to Writing at UC Irvine</i>, 13th edition.
</ul>
<p>
UCI offers several kinds of assistance to writers.
The website of the UCI Campus Writing Coordinator at
<a href="http://www.writing.uci.edu/">http://www.writing.uci.edu/</a>
has a great deal of information.
We particularly recommend the
<a href="http://www.writing.uci.edu/peertutors.html">
Writing and Library Research Peer Tutors</a>
and the
<a href="http://www.larc.uci.edu/wrtasst.html">
Learning and Academic Resource Center (LARC)</a>.

</p>


<!-- is the following section needed since we're not covering Java? -->
<p>
We are not assigning a specific textbook on Java programming,
but you may find it helpful to have one.  All books seem to
cover much more of the language than you'll need for this
class, so we recommend looking over a few in the bookstore
and choosing the one that seems the clearest to you.
There are also some valuable on-line resources for Java
(however, most of these do assume you have a programming background):
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/">The Java Tutorial</a>
<li> <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/">Java API Specification</a>
<li> <a href="http://www.javacoffeebreak.com/">Java Coffee Break</a>
</ul>

</p>

<h2>Policies</h2>

<h4>Academic Honesty</h4>
<p>
Do not claim as your own the words or ideas of others.
When you collaborate with or are helped by a classmate,
give credit.
When in doubt, talk with a TA or professor <i>before</i> turning in
your work.
A single act of cheating or academic dishonesty can seriously
mar your career at UCI.
Familiarize yourself with the
<a href="http://www.senate.uci.edu/9_IrvineManual/3ASMAppendices/Appendix08.html">
UCI Policy on Academic Honesty</a>,
particularly Section C and Section D "Authority of Faculty Members."
</p>

<h4>Add / Drop Policy</h4>
<p>
Students may add or drop US 12B up to the end of the
second week of classes (Jan 19), with the instructor's
signature on an "Add" card.
Students may add only if they are caught up on all readings
and assignments.
Students may drop after the second week only in exceptional
circumstances.
</p>

<h4>Communication</h4>
<p>
Check your UCInetID email frequently; we will occasionally need
to get in touch with you by email.
Please feel free to send email to the course staff:
use your UCInetID account, put <b>US 12</b> in the subject line,
and include your name in the message body.
This web page syllabus will be updated over the course of the
quarter, so please look at it regularly.
</p>

<h4>Health</h4>
<p>
Even though you are young and reasonably healthy,
as a user of computers
you are at risk for several computer-related
health problems, particularly RSI (repetitive-strain injury).
<em>Please</em> read and follow the good advice at the Bren School's
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~chair/comphealth2.html">
Computer Health and Safety</a> web page.
</p>

<h4>Special Accommodations</h4>
<p>
Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation based on the
impact of a disability should contact Prof. Tomlinson privately to discuss
his or her specific needs.
Also contact the Disability Services Center at (949) 824-7494 as soon as
possible to better ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a
timely fashion.
</p>

<h4>Late Work</h4>
<p>
The ten week quarter will pass very quickly, and it is essential that
all work be turned in on time so you can move on to the next assignment.
If possible, contact your TA as soon as you realize an assignment will
be late.
In general, the policy is a 10% penalty for work up to 24 hours late, 20%
penalty for work 25 to 48 hours late, and later work is not accepted
without approval from a professor.
</p>

<h4>Lunch</h4>
<p>
Not during class, please.
</p>

<h4>Computers and Cell Phones in Class</h4>
<p>
In lectures and discussions, you may use a notebook computer to take notes,
but you must first disable your wireless connection to the Internet.
Playing of games is, alas, strictly forbidden.
Turn off cell phones during class.
</p>

<h4>Disputes on scores and grades</h4>
<p>
If you think your work has not been correctly or fairly scored, talk
with your TA.  If you are still not satisfied, talk with Prof. Tomlinson.
All score disputes must be brought up within one week after the work
is returned.
If you have a concern pertaining to your final exam score or your grade,
contact Prof. Tomlinson before the end of the first week of the Spring quarter.
