Three neat Web finds:
<ol>
<li><A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/">ICS 1C:  Networked Information Discover and 
Retrieval</A> is what I refer to quite often because it contains references, hypertext 
terms, and much more.
<li>I am able to find out what types of credential programs are offered at UCI by looking at the <A 
HREF=http://olympia.gse.uci.edu/ <b>UCI Department of Education Home Page</b></A> and there is also a 
list of <A HREF=http://ea.oac.uci.edu/doc/colleges.html <b>College and University Home 
Pages</b></A> that I could look into, too.
<li><A HREF=http://akebono.standford.edu/yahoo/ <b>Yahoo - A Guide to 
WWW</b></A> is interesting to look at.  It has so much!

<LI><A NAME="QQ1"><B>What is the World Wide Web and how will I be able to access it?</B></A><br>
According to Tim Berners-Lee's article, "The World-Wide Web," the World-Wide Web (W3) was developed 
to be a pool of human knowledge, which would allow collaborations in remote sites to share their 
ideas and all aspects of a common project."  And according to December and Randall, "The World Wide 
Web is a convergence of computational concepts for presenting and linking information dispersed 
accross the Internet in an easily accessible way."  So, how can I find out more about the WWW?  
Well, there's <A HREF=http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/refs.html <b> 
The World Wide Web 
Unleashed</b></A> by December and Randall, <A 
HREF=http://www11.w3.org/ <b>World-Wide Web Home</b></A>, and the <A 
HREF=http://netspace.students.brown.edu/eos1/webs_image.html  
<b>Educational Online Sources</b></A>.

<LI><A NAME="QQ2"><B>What are some of the special connections within the Internet?</B></A><br>
First lets define <A HREF=ftp//nic.merit.edu/documents/fyi/fyi_20.txt <b>What is the Internet?</b></A>
It is the cooperatively-run, globally-distributed collection of computer networks that exchange
information via the TCP/IP protocol suite.  The Internet consists of many internetworked networks,
called internets (with a small <I>i</I>).  An internet is a single network that uses the TCP/IP
protocol suite, and some internets are not connected to the Internet.  There are some <A 
HREF=http://www.uwm.edu/Mirror/inet.services.html <b>Special Internet 
Connections</b></A> which contains 
information on games, business, science, computers, recipes, and much more.

<LI><A NAME="QQ3"><B>How can students communicate to other students around the
world?</B></A><br>
When I took the courses Multicultural Education and Theory and Practice here at UCI, I was told that 
there are ways that students can communicate to other students around the world.  So, when I was 
exploring the World Wide Web, I was able to find that the University of Michigan Dewey School of Education
had the <A HREF=http://ics.soe.umich.edu/ <b>Dewey Web</b></A>.  There 
was also a hotlist of K-12 Internet 
School Sites in <A HREF=http://www.wentworth.com/cyber/k12sites.html 
<b>K-12 World Wide Web Sites</b></A> 
where I could find out which schools are listed. 
<p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ4"><B>How can I get involved and get teacher training in NASA Langley Research Center's 
HPPC K-12 Program?</B></A><br>
I have heard of Project Smart, a program for those interested in teaching in the fields of science
and mathematics.  I also know that the HPPC (High Performance Computing and Communications) K-12 
is an education program that focuses on enhancing the science and mathematics curriculum. To get 
involved, one must learn more about it.  So, I have been looking through its 
<A HREF=http://k12mac.larc.nasa.gov/hpcck12home.html <b> Program Elements 
</b></A> to find out if 
they have any presentations of the program and if they offer any type of training sessions. There's 
so many programs that are available out there.  Some could be found in 
<A HREF=http://akebono.standford.edu/yahoo/Education/Programs<b> Educational 
Programs</b>.</A>

<LI><A NAME="QQ5"><B>How would I find out if Canadian Airlines has a direct flight to Vancouver? 
Also, how is the weather like over there?</B></A><br>
If you like traveling, Canada would be a great place to go.  Just choose 
a date and then buy a ticket from Canadian Airlines.  If you want to find 
out about their airline services, destinations, or find out how the 
weather is like, you could do so.  You just have to look at the <A 
HREF=http://www.CdnAir.CA/ <b> Canadian Airlines International</b></A> 
home page.  You could also check the weather by using the <A 
HREF=http://rs560.cl.msu.edu/weather/interactive.html <b> Weather 
Browser</b></A>.  After you have done so, you are ready to enjoy your trip.
