<h3>My Interesting Finds and Questions</h3>
Three neat Web finds:
<ol>
<li>I learned how to find the <A HREF="gopher://ka.reg.uci.edu/11/ro/soc"> 
schedule of classes </A> for the next 
quarter without having to wait for the printed scheduule to come out. 
Making my life a little more organized.
<li>I discovered how, while in lab, how to catch up on all of the latest 
<A HREF="http://tns-www.lcs.mit.edu/cgi-bin/sports"> 
sports information and scores. </A>
 <li>The web helped me to find out who 
the<A 
HREF="http://www.oslonett.no/home/erics/index.html"> Meher Baba </A> was and 
how to send and receive mind mail. Not to mention all of the holistic 
cures I found. </ol>

<A NAME="Questions"><H2>Questions I can now answer</H2></a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ1"><B>How does the internet help a college student?</B></A><br>
	It helps in any way that the internet helps anyone in the world, it can 
help the college student. It may just be the most useful tool that the majority 
of University students don't use. It can help you to accomplish things at 
your own University (especially<A HREF="http//www.uci.edu/student.html"> 
Anteaters</A>) more efficiently. It can be a replacement for 
all of the printed information you dare to collect. It also can be an <A 
HREF="http://www.einet.net/">
information and entertainment</A> center helping your brain to use and 
process all the information you care to look for. Through browsing the 
web students can meet people, discover things, and learn, all at the same 
time.

<LI><A NAME="QQ2"><B>What new technology will enhance the users 
experience on the web?</B></A><br>	 As the world wide web expands and more 
and more people begin to browse and add their own information to it, the web 
will become a more important and useful tool to them. New 
companies will put their time and efforts into making the time spent on 
the web more efficient and productive. Multimedia, new <A 
HREF="http://www_tios.cs.utwente.nl/say/">audio</A> and <A 
HREF="http://www.hypercomp.ns.ca/pixel.html"> video </A>technology will 
make the web an increasingly integral part of people's 
lives, while making the internet experience more entertaining and
productive.<p><A

<LI><A NAME="QQ3"><B>Who's being impeached in Romania?</B></A><br>
	The international political system has been greatly altered since the 
fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989. Newly independent countries are 
scrambling to better their economic and political situation. These new 
countries are places of intense focus for other Western countries. Long 
inaccessible they are now key areas for<A 
HREF='gopher://ulise.cs.pub.ro/00/Romania/AFACERI/topul.firmelor.private"> 
business</A> and investment. The unstable political system has led to shockingly fast <A 
HREF="gopher://lawnext.uchicago.edu/00/.centerfiles/review/v3n3n4/updates.txt"> 
political developments</A> (like the impeachment) which through the world 
wide web are made possible.<p><A

<LI><A NAME="QQ4"><B>Where do you snowboard in Scotland?
</B></A><br>
	Believe it or not there actually is a collection of snowboarders in 
Scotland. They have collected quite a dandy list of<A 
HREF="http://www.earth.ox.ac.uk/~andyc/accomodation.html"> 
spots and accomodations</A> There actually is a list of many of the best 
places to practice this sport throughouut Europe, incluuding such 
wonderful and exotic places as Finland and the French Alps. If you are 
looking to make a board for yourself or to hook up with new friends <A 
HREF="http://www.earth.ox.ac.uk/~andyc/"> this</A> is the place for 
you. You will also find pictures of the high flying authors. <p><A

<LI><A NAME="QQ5"><B>How can I prevent being lost at sea?</B></A><br>
	This may be a problem for manny  adventure seeking people that set sail 
throughout the world. <A HREF="http://www.alden.com/marine1.html"> New 
technology</A> coupled with <A 
HREF="http://www.cybermalls.com/cywharf/infocent/index.html"> ancient 
techniques</A> lead us today to quite a combination of methods. This relatively specialized 
business of providing marine navigation systems may produce economic 
opportunity for those with interest in this area. 
But finding what is best for you when you set sail on your adventure may 
be the most important decision you make. <p><A
