for CCCG 2012).
<p>
When a planar point set has the property that its Delaunay triangulation
has no large angles, we show how to connect it by a plane graph (having
linearly many additional Steiner vertices) in which the distances
between the original points are approximations to their Euclidean
distance, and in which the total graph weight is at most a constant
times the minimum spanning tree weight. The time to construct this graph
is near-linear, the same as for integer sorting. We use this result to
approximate the traveling salesman problem, for these point sets, in the
same time bound.

<i>Engineering with Computers</i>, special issue for the 21st
Int. Meshing Roundtable, to appear.
<p>
We describe a recursive subdivision of the plane into quadrilaterals in
the form of rhombi and kites with 60, 90, and 120 degree angles. The
vertices of the resulting quadrilateral mesh form the centers of a set
of circles that cross orthogonally for every two adjacent vertices,
and it has many other properties that are important in finite element meshing.

<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11083-013-9289-1"><i>Order</i>, to
appear</a>.
<p>
We generalize the 1/3-2/3 conjecture, according to which every partial
order should have a pair of items that are nearly equally likely to
appear in either order in a random linear extension, to antimatroids,
and we prove it for several specific types of antimatroid.

This paper combines our theoretical results on clique-finding algorithms
from ISAAC 2010 with our experimental results on the same algorithms
from SEA 2011.
