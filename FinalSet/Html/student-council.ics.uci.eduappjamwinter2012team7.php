				<div class="styled_title"><h1>Brief overview of the application and what it does</h1></div>
			</div>
				<p>
					Our application is built for the Android phone 2.3, it is a self guided tour through the campus here at UCI. It will give new students and visitors the opportunity to learn information about the campus and about the different buildings by themselves. This is beneficial for those who do not have the time for a scheduled campus tour or those who like to explore for themselves. This will help individuals by knowledge of their surroundings, giving them access to healthier eating locations, better study locations and a more complete understanding of their University and town. We have specific tours put into the app in which will direct the user to the buildings, explain a brief description and then take them to the next building on the specific tour. We have also added a feature in which any user can upload specific locations and descriptions so they can create their own tour to share or for themselves. 
<br /><br />
					There is also a feature to look up the location of specific buildings. You type the building name into a search bar and with our String search algorithm and we return the closest matching building that fits the description of the search. We incorporated ‘augmented reality' in which the user can use their camera feature on their phone incorporated with GPS and locate a specific building. This is helpful for new students who do not know their way around the campus yet and are not sure what buildings are what.  It provides a map and a GPS updates on where their location is compared to their destination. There is also a local saved profile in which will save the searches the user did and the tours that they have taken.

				<div class="styled_title"><h1>The process for making the application</h1></div>
			</div>
			<p>
The first night we basically hashed out ideas left and right until we settled in on the Learn UCI. We started by getting the ‘augmented reality’ feature, Google map function, and building incorporated into the app. This was instrumental in testing and figuring out how to put other features in. We had to test to make sure the ‘augmented reality’ feature was correct so we would test it on the phones we had to ensure that it located the specific building. We got exercise by walking around outside testing and debugging the features of our app. 
			</p>


            <div class="page-header">
				<div class="styled_title"><h1>Major hurdles that had to be overcome</h1></div>
			</div>
			<p>
Time conflicts for everyone was a challenge that goes without saying because we are all student and not on the same schedule. We had to meet as a team for a few hours each day and also work individually when we could. People had prior commitments and conflicts which we worked around. Only 2 members actually worked previously on apps that are publishable so we relied on them and we used a lot of online tutorials as resources. Most of us had to learn the different aspects of android on the run so that we can incorporate our specific feature. Writing the code for the augmented reality and location listener rather than importing libraries.

            <div class="page-header">
				<div class="styled_title"><h1>Lessons Learned</h1></div>

			<p>
Not to run an xml file. The use of a svn was a huge part of our success in working as a team. We had a few issues with it but by using it we saved countless hours. The only thing that we wish we could have done differently would be to have actual android phones so that we could test the functionality more. With our features that we added we were not able to test most of them on the emulator.
