          				<h2>Crawling the Web</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Goals</strong>:
								<ol>
									<li>To teach you how difficult crawling the
									web is in terms of scale and temporal
									requirements. The software itself is not the
									hard part of this assignment, it is managing
									all the data that comes back. This is only
									one web domain (project gutenberg-ish) after all.</li>
									<li>To teach you how difficult it is to
									process text that is not written for
									computers to consume. Again this is a very
									structured domain as far as text goes.</li>
									<li> To make the point that web-scale
									web-centric activities do not lend
									themselves to "completeness". In some sense
									you are never done. So thinking about web
									algorithms in terms of "finishing" doesn't
									make sense. You have to change your mindset
									to "best possible" given resources.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li><strong>Groups:</strong> This assignment may be done in groups of 1, 2 or 3. </li>
							<li><strong>Reusing code:</strong> You can use text
							processing code written by you or any other
							classmate for the previous assignment.  You cannot
							use crawler code written by non-group members. Use code found over the Internet at your own peril -- it may not do exactly what the assignment requests. If you do end up using code you find on the Internet, you must disclose the origin of the code.  Concealing the origin of a piece of code is plagiarism.  </li>

							<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> Use the Message Board for general questions whose answers can benefit you and everyone.</li>

							<li><strong>Write a program to crawl <a href="http://www.flatricidepulgamitudepedia.org/">flatricidepulgamitudepedia.org</a></strong>:
								<ul>
									<li>The provided, but not required, resources for this are the openlab machines, and the /extra/ugrad_space file folder</li>
									<li>Use <a
									href="https://code.google.com/p/crawler4j/">crawler4j</a>
									as your crawler engine.</li>
									<li>Follow the instructions at
									http://code.google.com/p/crawler4j/ and
									create your MyCrawler and Controller
									classes.</li>
									<li> Remember to set the maximum heap of
									java to an acceptable value. For example, if
									your machine has 2GB RAM. You may want to
									assign 1GB RAM to your crawlers. You can add
									-Xmx1024M to your java command line
									parameters.</li>
									<li>Make sure that you dump your partial
									results in a permanent storage as you crawl.
									For example, you can write palindromes
									longer than 20 characters in a file and
									after finishing the crawl, report the 10 longest
									ones. It is always possible that your crawl
									crashes in the middle. So, it's a good practice to have your partial results in a file. Also make sure to flush the file whenever you write in it.
									</li>
									<li>If you're crawling on a remote linux
									machine like openlab machines, make sure to
									use the nohup or screen command. Otherwise your crawling, which may take several days, will be stopped if your connection is disconnected for even a second. Search the web for how to use this command.</li>
									<li><strong>Input:</strong> Start your crawl at <a href="http://www.flatricidepulgamitudepedia.org/">http://www.flatricidepulgamitudepedia.org/</a></li>
									<li><strong>Specifications:</strong>
										<ul>
											<li>VERY IMPORTANT: Set the name of
											your crawler’s User Agent to “UCI IR
											student_IDs Team &lt;something&gt;”
											with one (individual project) or
											two/three (group project) student
											IDs.  We will be parsing your user
											agent to verify you did this right
											so get this correct.  Including
											capitals.</li>
											<li>VERY IMPORTANT: wait 100ms
											between sending page requests.  Violating this
											policy may get your crawler
											banned for 60 seconds.</li>
											<li>You should only crawl pages on the http://www.flatricidepulgamitudepedia.org/ domain</li>
											<li>We will verify the execution of
											your crawler in the web servers’
											logs.  If we don’t find log entries
											for your student ID, that means your
													crawler didn’t perform as it
													should or you didn’t set its
													name correctly; in the
													latter case we can’t verify
													whether it ran successfully
													or not, so we’ll assume it
													didn’t.</li>

											<li><a href="task_22/project.html">Setting up Eclipse</a></li>
											<li><a href="task_22/openlab.html">Running on Openlab</a></li>
										</ul>
									<li><strong>Output:</strong> Submit a
									document with the following information.
										<ol>
											<li>How much time did it take to crawl the entire domain? </li>
											<li> How many unique pages did you find in the entire domain?  (Uniqueness is established by the URL)</li>
											<li> How many links did you find in the content of the pages that you crawled?</li>
											<li> What is the longest page in terms of number of words? (HTML markup doesn’t count as words) </li>
											<li> What are the 25 most common words in this domain? (Ignore these <a href="http://www.ranks.nl/resources/stopwords.html">English stop words</a> Submit the list of common words ordered by frequency. </li>
											<li> What are the 25 most common 2-grams? (again ignore English stop
											words) A 2-gram, in this case, is a
											sequence of 2 words in which neither
											are stop words. Submit the list of
											25 2-grams ordered by frequency.</li>
											<li> What are the 10 longest
											palindromes that: 1) don't contain
											3 or more of the same letter in a
											row? 2) Don't occur on a page about
											Palindromes. What pages do they
											occur on? Submit your list.</li>
											<li>Extra credit: On which pages
											does the 2-gram "flatricide
											pulgamitude" show up? </li>
										</ol>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><strong>Submitting your assignment </strong>
								<ol>
									<li>We are going to use <a href="http://checkmate.ics.uci.edu">checkmate.ics.uci.edu</a> to submit this assignment.</li>
									<li>Make the file name &lt;StudentID&gt;-&lt;StudentID&gt;-&lt;StudentID&gt;-Task22.pdf</li>
									<li>Your submission should be a single pdf
									file submitted. Include your group member's
									names, answers to the questions above and
									any additional information that you deem
									pertinent.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li><strong>Evaluation</strong>:
								<ol> Correctness:
									<li>Did you crawl the domain correctly?  Verified in server logs.</li>
									<li>Are your answers reasonable?
										<ol>
											<li>Correct answers without evidence of correct crawling are not valid</li>
											<li>Answers will vary from crawler to crawler based on various factors.  "Correctness" will be based on reasonableness.</li>
										</ol>
									</li>
									<li>Due date: 02/06</li>
									<li>This is an assigment grade</li>
								</ol>
