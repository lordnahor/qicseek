				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have always heard, for as long as I remember, that correlation and causality are not the same.  That is OK.  They are indeed different.<br />
But there is always this implication by many, if not the most, people that correlation is second class and causality is the first class.  Causality should be respected while one should be cautious about correlations.</p>
<p>It bothers me whenever I hear that implication about the superiority of causality.  To me it is like saying that invention is better than necessity or that a baby is better than his mother.  Clearly there is a strong relationship between a mother and a baby and every mother wants her baby to go much farther than her.  It is important to remember, however, that baby follows mother.  Similarly, if there is no necessity than there is no need for invention, or without an established causal necessity, an invention is worthless.</p>
<p>Correlation is observed in data and then only people think of finding out the causal chain.  Except in purely theoretical reasoning, correlation seeds the need for causality.  Hence, I say that &#8216;Correlation is the Mother of Causality&#8217;.</p>
<p>In these days of Big Data (hype) if there is some thing really important, it is to understand correlations because then only causality may be explored and established.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Twitter became a very powerful medium and its popularity soared rapidly.  Twitter became a major News source for the latest events.  And it remains a popular site.  Many academic researchers are exploring all aspects of twitter ranging from how it is used, how information propagates on it, how can one get information, how can one detect sentiments, and so on.  Twitter data has become a good source of research papers for many budding researchers in different research fields.  On the other hand, many companies build products using Twitter data. Products ranging from early detection of trends, popularity of politicians, to sentiments of people on a particular topic have been productized.  However, there are some limitations of Twitter data for many applications.  </p>
<p>Twitter data is so broad in scope that any topics can be found in tweets, but unfortunately all topics are mixed together. If we treat the relevant information as signal, and all others as noise, twitter data has very low signal-noise-ratio (SNR).  Use of tools like hash-tags help, but do not really solve the problem.  Given this about current Twitter like social network, we believe that they all suffer serious issue of low SNR and are less effective as information sources. Therefore, we propose the concept of Focused Micro Blogs (FMB).  FMBs are on a focused topic and are targeted to a specific source.  Since the topic is fixed, the information in a FMB could be easily structured and parsed.   FMBs retain the important feature of sending brief real time information of Tweets, while overcoming their weakness of combining too many different topics in one place. This information is aggregated at a server designed for a specific task.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s consider one concrete example of FMB in a popular application for traffic â€“ the Waze.  Waze is an application on phones that takes GPS data periodically from the phone and uses this to compute the speed of the device.  This is aggregated at the server to know traffic conditions in different areas.  A user may also do a micro-blog using specific input mechanisms so that the system knows about a stalled car or a police officer at a specific location.  By using sensor data from the phone and specific micro-blog-inputs, a Waze server provides very useful information to its users.  This is an FMB in action.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are living in transformative times.  Our society is going through a major transformation both at the individual level as well as at the global level.  The most important factor in this transformation, the fuel powering this new engine, is the data; particularly the objective data collected using sensors.  However, data from only a specific sensor contains only partial truth about its environment.  Each sensor is designed to capture a particular attribute and most objects and events have several attributes that may change with time.  The fidelity of an object or an event improves with more diverse sensors to capture their attributes.  These attributes are captured by sensors recording the attributes as a time-varying signal at specific locations.  Billions of sensors are now continuously measuring different physical attributes at most locations of interest in the world.  Increasingly, a good fraction of these spatio-temporal measurements are being made available on the Web, giving us opportunity to create Web Observatories.</p>
<p>A very important and well recognized fact is that each data stream has valuable information.  But when two data streams are correlated it results in valuable insights.  As more number of data streams are correlated, better insights are created.  Thus, the fact that one can gain valuable insights by correlating multiple data streams collected for the same event or same person is well recognized, but techniques for doing this automatically have not been developed as well.  Currently, we are collecting increasing amount of such data leading to what is commonly called Big Data.  Data from different sensors is usually at different spatial resolution as well as at different frequencies.  Moreover, the type of data is multi modal, making the semantics of the data very different.  This poses serious problems in correlating these data streams.  We need efficient tools to correlate all such data streams to gain valuable insights.</p>
<p>Here we consider a specific case of such data being collected related to a person to create the persona that may be used in different contexts.  The persona of a person models different aspects of a person that are relevant to interactions with the person or for taking specific actions involving the person.  In this paper, we will consider a very limited case to understand building such an aspect of the persona of a person using different data streams.  The aspect that we consider is related to fitness and health and the data streams that we will consider are related to many sensors now being used by people to collect fitness data, personal events, eating habits, sleep patterns, and every day activities as collected using mobile phones and social networks.  Our goal is to understand challenges faced in correlating data from all these diverse data streams and develop a computational platform that will allow us to plug-in other data streams to include them in refining the persona.</p>
<p><strong>Health-Persona</strong></p>
<p>Until recently, and in most cases even now, all information about a person was very subjective.   Consider all information related to fitness and health related information about an individual.  We all had anecdotal information about how much exercise we do, how many hours we sleep, what we eat, and how our body is feeling.  But the recent information technology revolution is changing that.  Using a myriad fitness related wearable sensors, combined with mobile phones every minute of an individualâ€™s activities are being recorded that may be analyzed. We have seen a revolution that allows capturing information about â€˜selfâ€™ from many sources. What we are seeing is a major shift in how we got information about individuals.  In this paper, unless specifically mentioned, we will discuss fitness and health related information.  In this area, we can characterize changing trends into specific classes:</p>
<p><strong>Subjective Self:</strong> All information about a person was totally subjective.  This information could be collected from several sources, but it was mostly subjective interpretation by a person, including self, about the state of health.</p>
<p><strong>Quantified Self:</strong> People started collecting information using different sensors. Usually sensors donâ€™t lie, they give fairly objective information. Also, many sensors could be collecting data 24/7 and storing this on a server where this data could be analyzed.  This data is collected using a sensor for a specific aspect of fitness or health.  Such data could be visualized and some analytics could be done to help a person.</p>
<p><strong>Objective Self:</strong> Using multiple wearable sensors, people collect 24/7, many different attributes related to fitness and health.  Mobile phones and other sensors also collect information related to travel and location of activities that could be converted into different events in their personal life.  Information from personal calendar, social networks and other similar sources is also used.  All this information can be correlated to analyze lifestyle and help people in fitness and health.</p>
<p>We address more detailed aspects of observing and analyzing all data sources to get objective self health information and identify needs to build a powerful platform to accomplish this.</p>
<p><strong>(Will Continue)</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since Google + came in and introduced circles in a playful manner, people seem to be fascinated by circles.  I like them, but they are not what they appear to be. I want much more from my circles.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to form useful circles except for some obvious &#8216;fixed&#8217; relations in life &#8212; like my nearest family relations, my colleagues at work, people living in my neighborhood, people with same school that I went to etc.  And these things can even be algorithmically detected and formed.  They are not useless &#8212; like white bread is not useless.  But they are not very exciting also.  The real question is how useful they are after you have been using them for some time.</p>
<p>I usually find that almost every day, I come across a situation where I want to share something from people who are in different circles &#8212; I want to chat about Cricket or about American Football; want to talk about corruption in India and the damage religion is causing all over the world.  Theoretically, I can form a circle for each item, but practically this will mean that I am always running in circles.  Most of the circles are formed for a specific thing and they naturally exist for some time to serve a specific purpose.  Over time, these circles start becoming stale.  And this where the real problem lies &#8212; how to keep my circles relevant.  And for this, there has to be a better mechanism then the nice playful mechanism of creating Google Circles or an algorithmic approach (that can be manually refined) of Katango.</p>
<p>What is needed is an approach that will form contextual circles automagically with little human and mostly algorithmic component so as soon as I specify my context, the system creates a circle and uses it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When ranking was introduced by search engines, the first step towards recommendation was taken.  Ranking is a recommendation by the search engine only based on the keyword.  As search engine technology progressed, more and more &#8216;recommendation&#8217; was introduced.  As is well known, one of the most active area in search is to create user profiles and understand their context to understand their intent and then recommend what they may be looking.  Of course this is mostly called ranking based on different pieces of information.</p>
<p>At one time, recommendation engines were lot more focussed at only a few shopping sites.  But as advertisement started becoming dominant, search and recommendation also started coming close.  But that is only a short term trend.  In fact recommendation is central to solving the information overload problem.  As we all know, information overload is one the major problems created by advancement in information technology, particularly the Web.</p>
<p>I am sure soon we will see recommendation engines become very active in helping recommend each piece of information for a user and become a strong filter.  That will mean having a better information about the user and her context and use that in filtering what information should go to which user.  This is definitely an interesting challenge for people working on reducing information overlaod.</p>
