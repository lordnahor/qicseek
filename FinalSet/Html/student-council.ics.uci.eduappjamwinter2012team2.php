				-Suggests activities for people to do based on user preferences and category.
				<br /><br />-Pushes the user to have a more dynamic social life.
				<br /><br />-Provides an interface to get people to share ideas.

				<br /><br />Many times when spending time with friends, no one can think of an activity to do at all. IdeaFactory helps people think of ways to spend their time by suggesting activities for them to do. It pushes the user to have a more active social life by suggesting exciting places to go or new things to do. By using our app, people can enrich their lives and become more whole and interesting.
				<br /><br />IdeaFactory suggests Ideas to the user based on their preferences and input. For example, if the user wanted an Idea that has to do with "Fitness", the app might suggest that the user "Run a lap around the structure you're in." If the user wanted to go to a "Social Event", the app might suggest that they visit Dumbledore's Anteaters, a club at UCI that discusses Harry Potter. 
				<br /><br />The user has the ability to give the app their preferences and it would suggest Ideas based on them. If the user thinks that an idea is particularly good, then they can "Like" the Idea and it would come up more often in the future for other users. Conversely, they can "Dislike" a bad Idea.
				<br /><br />Sometimes people don't need any help with thinking of great activities to do; in that case they can post their ideas for other people to try out using this app. Using GoogleMaps, they can pinpoint specific times and locations that these activities take place, like where and when Dumbledore's Anteaters meet up each week.
				<br /><br />Using this app, it is much easier for people to become more involved with their communities and to do activities to better themselves. By performing things that are outside of a person's comfort zone, they can grow to become a better and more interesting individual.

				These are important algorithms that IdeaFactory has incorporated:
				<br /><br />Ideas Tab:
				<br /><br />This tab displays the best ideas according to the user's preferences. First, the ideas are fetched by user's preferences from the database. Then we apply the following heuristics to the fetched results: from the fetched ideas, we calculate the score of the idea. The idea is not displayed if the idea has been viewed more than a certain number of times, if the score is zero or below, or if the idea has already been rated by the user.
				<br /><br />Searching Location from Google Maps:
				<br /><br />In the Add location field, we take the input from the user for the location and pass this location string to the backend which calls Google Maps API for GeoCode using a PHP script and finds the latitude and longitude for the location string. The script sends back these coordinates which are used to project the location on Google Map. These coordinates are also stored in the database.
				<br /><br />Search Tab:
				<br /><br />The search algorithm was perhaps the most complex part in our project. We implement the UNIX grep like feature for SQL. We get the queries from the database for the corresponding category and then apply a LIKE operator for checking all the combination of the words in the appearing in the query to implement a effective search function.
				<br /><br />Data Structures Used:
				<br /><br />We have used ArrayList and HashMap in different parts of the project. ArrayList is used for storing the selected categories and simultaneously HashMap is used to improving the time complexity from O(n) to O(1).

				<p>
					We see a lot of interest in the social-web space. Many people upload pictures of themselves and give status information to the world. We use this interest in being socially to help the user make productive use of his/her time. By posting his/her idea, the user also helps the Social world know some interesting way to use time. Our thought-process, on one end, was to think of making an application that would help the user in making good use of his/her time. Secondly, a parallel view to build something that would not only help the user alone. We wanted to use this "interest" of being socially active, in a way that it would help other users too. By posting ideas, a user helps other users know of some interesting way of making use of their time.

				We relied mostly on the standard application buttons and graphics that are native to Android devices. On a high level, we used Google Image Search for the images that were used for Buttons and Tabs. There were many images that we brought into IdeaFactory and so writing the URL for each image doesn't seem the best way to present things.
			</p>

			<div class="page-header">
				<div class="styled_title"><h1>The process for making the application</h1></div>
			</div>
			<p>
				<br /><br/>In our first meeting, we started brainstorming on different kinds of apps that can help people in improving themselves by letting them make effective use of time. So after coming up with different ideas, we finally decided on creating an app that will let users to share their ideas about certain categories. So users with similar category interest can view these ideas. Before the start of day 2, we made sure that each one of us had the Android set-up on their computer and that we went through the online tutorial. Day 2 was all about designing wherein we thought of different designs for our application and zeroed upon one.  We then set up the Mercurial repository for managing the code. We started Day 3 by splitting up the work on GUI design and backend. Every team member was responsible for completing his own task. 
				<br /><br/>Once we implemented the basic functionalities of our app, we spent time on testing these. Debugging was major task in everyone's to-do list. 

				<br /><br/>Next step was to include Google Maps in our app to allow users to set a location for a particular idea. So using this feature the user could tag an idea with a location. Then we started designing images for different buttons and tabs based on the functionality of the same. Simultaneously we were working on removing the minor bugs in the app.

				<br /><br/>We decided to include another field, description, for an idea which would contain some extra information for the same. We realized that some activities, for example an upcoming event in the neighborhood, would come with an expiration date. Beyond this date, IdeaFactory should not suggest that activity to the user. We added this functionality to IdeaFactory too.

            <div class="page-header">
				<div class="styled_title"><h1>Major hurdles that had to be overcome</h1></div>
			</div>
			<p>
				<br /><br/>Except for one team member, no one else had any experience with any type of mobile application development. So we had to quickly go through the basics of android development by watching the videos of android development workshop.
			<br /><br/>Team having mid-terms and assignments to finish was a hurdle and we had to incorporate this fact in our schedule for AppJam. However, except for one day, we managed to meet every day and worked throughout the day.
			<br /><br/>We used Mercurial as our code repository. Merging the code-changes done by team using Mercurial was a challenge as it involved removing many conflicts. We dedicated time for this merging, everyday, so that we sail smoothly.
			<br /><br/>Since most of the functionality of our application is interlinked with each other, dividing the tasks so that everyone can work on it independently was also one of the challenges that we faced.
			<br /><br/>IdeaFactory uses My-SQL database to store the data related to the application. Over the course of development, we had to make many changes to the database schema as we added more features to the application. This involved removing the data, changing the schema and adding the data again for testing purpose.
			<br /><br/>IdeaFactory uses Google Map API to show the location of the activities. Getting these APIs working on the system took time and involved a lot of research.
			</p>
			

            <div class="page-header">
				<div class="styled_title"><h1>Lessons Learned</h1></div>
			</div>
			<p>
			<br /><br />Spending time on designing the application without any code helps. We all come from different programming skill levels and so another helpful feature of this diversity was using all the knowledge we have as a team in developing the application. 
			<br /><br />Integrating Google Map in our application, we learnt that how we perform a search in the Map. Even setting up Google APIs for Google Maps was interesting. 
			<br /><br />Building a central code- repository and dedicating time towards code-merging is critical. 
			<br /><br />In the end, we worked hard, and we are satisfied with the final outcome of our hard work.
