I say that the website says we can.  He says this and each station have different policies and here we have to ask permission from the station manager.  We say okay and leave, and walk over to Charing Cross stations.</p><p>Charing+ Station:<br>I take photos of the plaza outside the station, which is only a few meters away from Trafalgar square.  The outside of this station is also the entrance to a British Rail depot.  As I go to walk down the steps into the station another officer stops me and says I can't take photos.  I argue that it's a public building.  He says I have to talk to the station manager.  I say the Transport for London website says I can take photos as long as I don't use flash and I am an amateur.  He says according to section 14(?) of the anti-terrorism act he is authorized to stop me and take my details.  I say no, I am in a public place.  He says he can ask me what the photos are for and I say I am a student doing a research project.  He keeps pushing the anti-terrorism act and that he can take my details.  I keeps saying the website and TFL say photos are allowed.  He tells me there are a lot of things on the internet and you can't believe them and that he is not a fake police officer, he is real.  I argue that I called and confirmed it was legal (a lie) and he keeps saying the internet is fake so finally my friend diffuses the situation and we agree to go downstairs and ask the station manager.</p><p>In the ticket/assistance booth in the station the woman says we can take photos but we need permission for flash.  I say we don't want to use flash and she calls someone and says it's fine.  I ask her if she can write a note because the police officers outside don't believe me.  She says it's fine in the station but I need permission from British Rail to take photos of the outside of the building.  But the cops upstairs told me to ask you I say, but to no avail.  I think to myself, apparently I am a f***ing terrorist.</p><p>Camden Town Station:<br>My friend and I went to Mornington Crescent from Charing Cross.  We took plenty of photos there and I got the feeling that people (attendants and riders) thought it was fine because of the quirky significance of the station.  We then walked up to Camden Town.  The gates of the station are on street level there.  I took a few photos of the exterior and gates first.  Then, inside I tried to catch a few details.  By the escalators there was a glass window, maybe part of a control booth, and in the window was a digital service-status display.  I took a photo of it and then one of the station attendants who had been eyeing me came over and gave me the you-can't-take-photos lines.  She said I needed permission from the station manager.  I said I had it but that didn't really work.  So I held my camera down and said I'd stop.  My friend was photographing the station as well, but she had already gone down the escalator so I followed.</p><p>Angel Station:<br>In the tunnel towards the exit in Angel station my friend snapped a photo from a distance of a busker.  As we walked past him he stops playing, but we don't give him any money.  He says we can't just take photos of him, he's not a monument.  He finishes his rant by saying that we aren't allowed to take photos in the tube anyway.</p><p>Bond Street Station:<br>After hanging out in Angel with my friend and then I went into town to meet a participant at the transport museum.  After that I walked up to Tottenham Court station and took some photos there.  I didn't linger too much in the main ticket hall but I managed to take several with no problems.  I then took the Central line to Bond Street to meet a bunch of friends at Selfridges.  I wasn't in the best mood.  So I get off the train and start taking some platform photos.  First, I snap the tile pattern behind the benches and then the ceiling over the train.  Then I peeked into one of the little passageways connecting the two platforms and the colors were nice so I took a photo down the side of the tile.  A platform attendant wearing a white shirt with a name-tag (more official looking than most) came up to me saying I can't take photos.  I started by saying I had permission from the station managers and he said there was no way I could because no photos are allowed.  I asked if it was just for today and he said always.  I asked just this station, and he said everywhere.  I disagreed and asked when that became a policy and he said since 7/7 no photos were allowed in the tube.  I argued that no I have been taking plenty of photos and had permission and he was all since 7/7 blah blah.  I got pretty frustrated and said fine I'd go.  I exited the station into a mall like thing and defiantly took photos of the exterior.</p><br><br></span></body></html>
