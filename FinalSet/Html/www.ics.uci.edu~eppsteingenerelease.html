<h2>Release 4.3.4</h2>
</div>

<p>The most recent release of Gene is 4.3.4, released April 2001.
New features in Gene 4.3.4 include improved tree layout, a new "Name
Change" card type, source
fields on many card types, better control of GEDCOM export for event
cards, the ability to export subsets of the database, and a new command
for finding stray cards; see the <a href="UserGuide.html">User Guide</a>
for details.  Gene 4.3.4 also fixes several <a href="bugs.html">bugs in
earlier versions</a>.</p>

<p>Gene 4.3.4's file format is upward-compatible with all previous
versions: Gene 4.3.4 can read older Gene files, but files using the new
features of Gene 4.3.4 may not be readable in older versions of Gene.</p>
