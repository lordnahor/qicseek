<br><b>Text:</b> <a href="http://www.osborne.com/unixtcr/webcomp.htm"><i>Unix:
The Complete Reference</i></a> by Kenneth Rosen, Douglas Host, 
James Farber, and Richard Rosinski; Osborne/McGraw-Hill; July, 1999;
ISBN: 0-07-211892-X.

<p>
This course is an in-depth study of principles and concepts embodied
in modern Internet-connected, multiuser, multitasking operating
systems (MICMMOS, :-) ), including shells, filters, pipelines,
programmability and scripting, extensibility, concurrent processing,
and interprocess communication.  Several integral tools and utilities
are presented.  Unix is used to provide concrete examples, focusing
on the file system, processes, shells, and various tools including
awk, diff, file, find, ftp, grep, make, man, nslookup, sed, sort,
tar, traceroute, uniq, vi, which, zip, etc.</p>
<p>
The course provides a solid conceptual and experiential basis for
subsequent work in the programming, system administration, and
effective general use of the Unix operating system.  This conceptual
basis for subsequent work is more generally applicable to other
MICMMOS's and to later courses which study or use them.</p>

<p>
<b>Lectures and Readings</b>
<p>
Lectures will follow 
<a href="./schedule.html#read">assigned readings given in the course
schedule</a>.
You should (at least) skim the readings before the lectures
and plan a thorough (re-)reading after the lecture.
<p>
Most of the assigned readings will come from the text and
most of the text will be assigned readings for the course.
Assigned readings not from the text will be available on the
web or through the Engineering Copy Center, 203 Engineering Tower.

<p>This book is as much is as much an economical reference as a text.
Its list price is $39.99, but it has been available on the web for
less than $29, including tax and shipping.  Two web sites which
allow you to compare book prices are 
<a href="http://www.bookarea.com">www.bookarea.com</a> and
<a href="http://www.mysimon.com">www.mysimon.com</a></p>

<p>
<b>Homework Assignments</b>
<i>(30% of final grade)</i>
<p>
Homework assignments complement the lectures and readings.
There will be between 4 and 5 major assignments and
some minor assignments.
Assigments will be discussed and reviewed in during discussion
sections.
Homework that is late, without prior arrangement, will have the
score it earns decreased by 25% for each 24 hours or fraction
thereof it is late.  Thus, homework submitted 40 hours late
will earn no more than half of the maximum score possible.
<p>
All work presented must be your own unless the assignment
allows for group/team work.
In general, you are welcome, indeed encouraged, to offer and
to seek assistance, but the final product submitted must
represent the work of the person(s) submitting it.
In the case of group/team assignments, each member of
the group submitting the assignment must be indicated and
all members are responsible for understanding all parts of
the work submitted.

<p>
<b>Quizzes and Final Exam</b>
<i>(60% of final grade)</i>
<p>
There will be 5 in-class quizzes with the best 4 scores counting
toward 30% of the final grade and the final exam counting 30%.
A missed test receives a score of 0.
You are allowed and encouraged to use written reference materials:
the text, your course notebook (see below),
a favorite reference, etc.  All materials used must be
bound or kept in some sort of notebook.  Loose sheets of paper
are not allowed.
During a test, no sharing or borrowing
of reference materials is allowed.

<p>
<b>Class Participation and Course Notebook</b>
<i>(10% of final grade)</i>
<p>
Class participation includes lectures, discussion sections,
electronic communication, and other interactions.
It includes asking and responding to questions, offering comments,
helping others, and (in general) taking responsibility
both for your own learning and for helping others learn.
<p>
Every student is encouraged (indeed, <em>urged</em>) to keep
a course notebook including relevant reference materials and
recording questions (and answers), course activities, observations,
etc.
One can expect to find such a notebook useful throughout all
aspects of this course (including, as mentioned above, quizzes
and the final exam) and of continuing value outside the course
as well.

<p>
<b>Important Policies and Procedures</b>
<p>
In addition to the standard
<a href="http://www.senate.uci.edu/9_IrvineManual/3ASMAppendices/Appendix08.html">
