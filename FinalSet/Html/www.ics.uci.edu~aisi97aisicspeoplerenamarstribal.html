<P>The Cherokee Indians originated from the southeastern United States. The
first contact with the Europeans was in the 1500s. Cherokee Nation is
recognizing as one of the most progressing among American Indians.  The
marking point for the Cherokee people was around 1710 when the tribe traded
with the whites.  The whites exchanged goods for Cherokee land and
eventually the Cherokee�s and whites became a government and a society.</P>
<P>Some Cherokees decided to migrate because they were wary of the Europeans
intentions. They moved westward and settled in the areas of the country�s
frontier. Cherokees that stayed were forced off their land when a treaty was
passed in 1835. After the treaty was passed it was all down hill from
there!</P>
