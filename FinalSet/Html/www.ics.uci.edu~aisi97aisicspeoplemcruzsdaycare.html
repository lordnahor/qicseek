<center><h4>About Our Day Care</h4></center>
<p>	Welcome to Golden Eagle Day Care. Here is a brief introduction to our day care.  I hope this will answer any questions you may have.</P>
<p>Golden Eagle Day Care is located in Blank,Ca.  We have 5 women that are licensed to care for 7 children each.  We accept children of all ages,from infants 
to school aged both full time and part time.  The school aged children should attend Jumpstart Elementary School.</P>
<P>We provide child care Monday thru Friday during the hours of 6:30a.m. to 6:00p.m.  The children will be served breakfast, lunch, and daily snacks.</P>
<P>Communication is very important to us.  We always like to take some time during the day, whether
it be during drop off time, pick up time, or just a phone call from the parents to discuss the days events. We like to let the parents
know what their child ate, who they played with their child.  We encourage drop in visits and phone calls.</P>
<P>The children play outside daily in a privacy fenced area.  We think that it's very important fof the children to get a lot of
fresh air.  In the summer time we enjoy playing in the sprinkler, sandbox, and the play houses.  Picnics are also a favorite pasttime for us during warm weather.</P>
</P>Thank your for Visiting the Golden Eagle Day Care on the Web.  If you have any questions or comments or would like to schedule an interview you may reach
one of our Care Takers at (333)555-3984 or <U>email</u> us.  Hope to hear from you soon.</P>
