I think it will eventually go to keycards, they will have bar codes that scan everywhere and depending on your password or security level of code that depends on where you can and cannot get in. It creates a type of social level of acceptance.]]></description>

Europeans can already scan items they choose to purchase with a single click of a button, along with checking prices to get a better deal with one button.  There will be no need for Ids, wallets or paper money as long as you have your cell phone you can do anything and if you lose it, your whole life is ruined!]]></description>
