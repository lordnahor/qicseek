In order to realize the goal, we first classify the flooding areas into three groups based on the flooding situations as well as the sufficiency of shelters. Then for those people who tweeted about flood from the dangerous areas, we send tweets to them and direct them to the nearest shelters in safe areas <a href="ApplicationFiles/FloodShelterAlerts.html">more...</a>

<img src="images/iPhone.png" width=200px align="left"><b>Operations Research</b><br>The query aims to find the best location to start a new store for iPhone 3G. In this example, e-mages corresponding to the term `iPhone' were added for 14 days. On the other hand, the AT&T retail store locations emage was convolved with the catchment area (assumed to be a Gaussian Kernel) for each store. The difference between the obtained `aggregate interest' and `net catchment area' images was taken to be a representative of the `under-served interest areas' where it makes sense to open a new retail store <a href="ApplicationFiles/SupplyDemand.html">more...</a>

<img src="images/SwineFlu.png" width=200px align="left"><b>Epidemic Spread Analysis</b><br>We first undertook micro-event detection on the data using keywords like ‘flu’, ‘H1N1’, ‘sore-throat’ etc. to detect user level micro event. Next we aggregated user interest patterns across whole US into ‘social image’ as shown in he figure alongside. Next we used a situation detection operator (segmentation in this case) on the social image to segment US into different zones with ‘Epidemic’, ‘Medium’, ‘Low’ levels of swine-flu activity <a href="ApplicationFiles/EpidemicSpreadAnalysis.html">more...</a>
