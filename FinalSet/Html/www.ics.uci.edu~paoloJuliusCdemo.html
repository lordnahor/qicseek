<h2 align=left> (NOTE: The server that previously run the interpreter is currently down due to my departure from UCI. You can consult the codes but unfortunately you cannot run them. Sorry.) </h2>

<P ALIGN=RIGHT> <i> [At this time, JuliusC is an interpreter. It takes
a C program as input, it analyzes the input and it generates a
<b>type-DAG</b> as output. The analysis may require the execution of
the input, but in general, it is only partial.]  </i></P>
<ol>
<hr>

<li> <h3>Considerations</h3> 

<P> The <b>Type-DAG</b> has several practical applications and we will
present some of them in the following. We present 6 types of
application, each one representative of a particular
feature-concept. We generate the
<b>type-DAG</b> on demand using a cgi-scripts, but we have some
limitations.
</P>

<ul>
<li> The server running the scripts is not the spiffiest model from
     Fujitsu (and it is not the latest either; i.e., HAL 100 has a
     SPARC64 100 MHz) far from it. Therefore, we limit the level of
     interactivity. <b>JuliusC</b> runs on inputs for which the problem size
     is fixed. Otherwise, the input program and the problem size can
     be chosen at run time.</li>

<li> The graphical interface is somewhat naive, but it should be clear
     enough to convey our message across. </li>
</ul>

<P> Let's get started </P>

<ol>
<li> <b> Debug Tool:</b> Whether or not a program stops it is an
undecidable problem. 

<p>The <b>type-DAG</b> can be used to help solving this
problem. Indeed, a recursive algorithms does not stop, when, at any
time, the execution visit a function call multiple times with same
inputs. If the inputs specify the flow of the execution, this will
create a loop in the <b>type-DAG</b>.  </P>

<P> <b>JuliusC</b> is insensitive to the no-ended recursion: it stops when it
reaches a computation leaf or when it finds a node with same
characteristics. In the latter case, the <b>type-DAG</b> is not a DAG
because it has a cycle. We find a cycle by determining a topological
order of the <b>type-DAG</b> and specifying a back-edge. </p>

<P> <a href="cyclic_recursion.c"> cyclic_recursion.c </a> is the input and  
<A HREF="http://halps.ics.uci.edu/cgi-bin/JuliusC/cyclic.prl"> run <b>JuliusC</b> </A> </P>
</li>
<li> <b> Dynamic Programming:</b> Several text book authors introduce
dynamic programming as solution for some of the limitations of divide
and conquer algorithms. Some algorithms divide a problem in unbalanced
sub-problems and they recompute partial solution that have already
computed.
    
<P> We present two examples: one is the classical binomial
computation, the other computes a balanced factorization of on an
integer <i>n</i>. </P>
     <ul>
     <li>  Binomial <i>n</i> over <i>k</i> has solution <i>
     n!/((n-k)!k!)</i>. <b>JuliusC</b> allows us to solve the binomial
     problem in polynomial time and space.

     <li> For the implementation of Cooley-Tookey FT, it is required
     to determine the factorization of an integer <i>n</i> in two
     factors <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> so that <i>n=pq</i>. Recursively,
     we need to determine the factors for <i>p</i> and <i>q</i>.  

     <P> We present two factorizations algorithms, very similar in
     nature. Both determine a balanced factorization: one is exact the
     other is a heuristic. </P>

<li> <b> FFT:</b> we present the Cooley-Tookey Fourier Transform with
a balance factorization. 

     <P> Vitter et al. proposed this algorithm and it takes
     <i>O(nloglogn)</i> steps for <i>n=2^m</i>. This algorithm is
     extremely interesting because it allows to minimize the number of
     function calls for any <i>n</i> (therefore the overhead). We
     present the <b>type-DAG</b> for two algorithms: one using an
     exact balanced factorization and another using a heuristic.

<li> <b> Fractal Matrix Multiply: C+=AB:</B> this is a classic example
      of recursive algorithm.

     <P> Matrix Multiply has several algorithms (e.g.; Strassen's). We
     present a recursive algorithm with a simplified implementation
     using non standard layout (<b>fractal layout</b> or
     <b>Z-morton</b>). The result presented here is not correct, but
     the algorithm has the same sequence of function calls as well as
     complexity of the correct algorithm. </P>

     </li>

<li> <b>Fractal All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP):</b> we know that
all-pairs shortest paths problem is computationally equivalent to
matrix multiplication (the classic <i>O(n^3)</i> matrix
multiply). This means that we cannot compute either one any faster
than the other.

     <P> We present an algorithm for APSP that is a version of Fractal
     matrix multiplication (the two algorithms are more than
     computationally equivalent). This algorithm use non standard
     layout and it is simplified. The output is incorrect but the
     algorithm has the same sequence of function calls as well as
     complexity of the correct algorithm.</P>

<li> <b>Fractal LU-Factorization:</b> this algorithm is fairly
complex. It uses non standard layout, it is based on fractal matrix
multiplication and it does not perform pivoting.

     <P> We compute the LU-factorization for a small matrix
     <i>50x50</i>. Without pivoting, this algorithm is extremely
     unstable, therefore it may take a long time to run in this
     architecture because of it. </P>
