I completed my first semester at a community college and requested for this
eight week program in California.  Now I am here at UC Irvine taking computer
science, and I'll be here for awhile. Next week I'll start my Internship at
Xerox.  It sounded interesting.  I'll be there for the next four weeks.  It
ends August 15.  The 16th is graduation.

<P>
Again I completed another four weeks
of school and it wasn't too bad.  The classes were not as bad but the lectures
seem to be important.  After awhile we get this unexpected LECTURE at the end
of school, which should have been the beginning of school.  I guess going to
a University is tough unless you know what it is like.  Then again I've
really enjoyed this experiment and want to tackle this program again.
Before I was just worried about my surroundings because I was not used to
being around people that I've never met or seen in my life.
