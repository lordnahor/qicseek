    <li>
    <div class="faqQuestion">What’s HealthWatch?</div>
    <div class="faqAnswer">
        <p>HealthWatch is built for a research project that tries to assist diabetes patients to discover the connections between their diet, 
        physical activities and their glucose. Diabetes patients often report different reaction to the same food. Doctors can give general advises, 
        but patients need to take active actions to identify their own patterns. This project aims to create computing tools that can facilitate this process. 
        HealthWatch includes a web application and an Android mobile application.</p>
        <p>One highlight of the design is that we do not use standard nutrition language. Recording a meal using such a language requires a lot effort as they 
        often describe ingredient in exact weights (such as grams). But personal pattern is all about personal knowledge. People like to change things a bit to 
        make it fun. But we do not believe they would change it too dramatically and too often. Most time, people probably have a pool of 20 or 30 dishes they 
        cook frequently. So even the description of a meal sounds ambiguous to outsiders, as long as the patient can recall what it is, it is good enough for 
        personal pattern discovery. By making it easier to record things, we believe it would make diabetes management less stressful (especially for newly 
        diagnosed patients who face a huge life style change).</p>

        <div class="faqQuestion">What are being logged?</div>
        <div class="faqAnswer">
            <p>Obviously, we do not tell patients what to do. Instead, we try to accommodate their natural behaviors. But in our design, we understand 
            diabetes patients often measure regularly their glucose throughout the day. In specific, the first measurement happens right after they wake up. 
            This measurement is typically lower. During the day, patients are advised to take measurements after every meal. The practice is to take it one or 
            two hours after the food intake. This will give enough time for the glucose to reflect the impact of food intake. Exercises can have the same 
            influence. But, they are less studied than food. <b>A full day’s records on HealthWatch would include a morning glucose measurement, three meals 
            (or more if snacks are consumed), glucose measurements after each meal, and some form of (hopefully daily) exercise.</b></p>

        <div class="faqQuestion">Mobile app’s features</div>
        <div class="faqAnswer">
            <p>HealthWatch’s Android app allows patients to log entries on the go. It includes very basic logging features and a list view of past records. 
            For each entry, it collects:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>The time of event</b>: when is the meal consumed? When is the exercise? When is the glucose measured?</li>
                    <li><b>Type of event</b>: meal or exercise or glucose. Meal has four subtypes: breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack. Glucose has five subtypes: 
                    after fast, after breakfast, after lunch, after dinner, and check up.</li>
                    <li><b>Description of the entry</b>: that is a short description of the meal, or exercise, or glucose reading (numeric values). 
                    For meal and exercise, this entry is supposed to be reused, so that the same food would be labeled using the same language, 
                    which would make it easier to discover patterns. Therefore, these two fields have an auto-complete features that would prompt the user 
                    with past entry’s descriptions that matching the characters they have typed.</li>
                    <li><b>Event date/time</b>: this is defaulted to the current date/time to encourage recording at the time of event. However, 
                    some people prefer to record them at a later time. In that case, they can edit this value to the right date/time (however, 
                    we believe that people would have difficulty recalling their food intake after two days).</li>
                    <li><b>Optional comment</b>: this comment is used to record anything additional about the entry. As the entry description is supposed to be 
                    succinct and reused, we expect non-significant details are captured by this field. By non-significant, we mean details that do not warrant 
                    this meal recorded using a different language, but might be useful when trying to recall what it is. For example, MacDonald’s cheeseburger 
                    has very similar ingredient as Burger King’s cheeseburger. Therefore, such an entry could simply say “cheeseburger”, but comment field 
                    would say whether it is MacDonald’s or Burger King’s. However, if the cheeseburger is from The Island, such an entry should say 
                    “cheeseburger from The Island” as it has very different ingredients and portion.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Here is a short video demostrating the mobile app.</p>

        <div class="faqQuestion">Mobile app’s settings</div>
        <div class="faqAnswer">
            <p>There are a few settings that control various aspects of the mobile app:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <div class="screenshots"><img src="../../Content/images/HealthWatchMobile5.png" /></div>
                    <div class="clear"></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Glucose warning high/low</b>: these two settings allow HealthWatch to capture glucose readings outside the desired range. 
                If a glucose reading falls outside this range, it would be highlighted. In addition, all food taken within the time set in 
                “Post-meal check in (minutes)” would be highlighted too. This way, patients are reminded to pay attention to that particular meal and 
                explore possible explanation.</p>
                    <p>In reality, we probably need two ranges as the early morning reading (after fasting) should be a lot lower than all others during the day. 
                    But there are also little patients could do about it as they were not doing anything during sleep. So to simply the process, 
                    we have only one range that targets the other daytime measurements.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Morning reminder/Time</b>: when “Morning reminder” is checked, the app will set reminders for the time specified in “Time”. 
                This works like an alarm. When it is the time, HealthWatch would send a reminder, which will show in Android device’s notification bar 
                (very much the same as when you receive a text message). Touching the notification would open HealthWatch’s glucose entry screen.</li>
                <li><b>Post-meal check in (minutes)</b>: in addition to be used with glucose warning high/low settings to highlight “suspicious” meal, 
                this setting is also used to remind patients to measure the glucose. Specifically, a reminder would be sent half an hour before 
                reaching this time frame. For example, if a patient has her lunch at 1pm (and logs it right afterwards) and this setting is 120 (minutes), 
                the app will remind her at 2:30 (half an hour before reaching the timeframe, which is 1pm+2 hours = 3pm) that she should measure her glucose.</li>
                <li><b>User ID/Password</b>:  the mobile app does not need a userID or password to function. But with a valid user ID and password, 
                the mobile app will synchronize with the website. Because the mobile app has a very simple interface, the website allows better view of 
                the entries and a few extra features (sort/search). See “Synchronization between mobile app and web application” for details.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="faqQuestion">Synchronization between mobile app and web application</div>
        <div class="faqAnswer">
            <p>If correct userID and password are provided, the mobile app will attempt to synchronize with the web application when the app is started, 
            or when an entry is saved/edited/deleted. This synchronization is supposed to happen quietly. If it fails due to any reason 
            (for example, the user shuts the app down before it can finish), it will attempt again next time. The only indication of the synchronization 
            is happening is the background color of the disclaimer. Normally, it has a bright yellow background. But when it changes to orange, 
            it means the synchronization has started. It would go back to bright yellow once synchronization is finished.</p>
            <p>During synchronization, the mobile app will send all new changes to the web server. The web server would return the processing result as 
            well as new changes from the web. So a user can use either the mobile app or the website to record information. If there is a conflict, 
            the timestamp of an entry would be compared and the latest change would overwrite an out-of-date change. The mobile app takes ownership 
            of the synchronization process, i.e. the web server will not make contact with mobile app when it has new changes and request synchronization. 
            It simply waits until the mobile app contacts and reply with changes.</p>
