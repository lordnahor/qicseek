<LI><A NAME=><H2>Is there going to be additional Star Wars Movies?</H2></A>
My answer is...I have really enjoyed the Star wars 
movies and have wonder if there is going to be another trigilogy.  George 
Lucus has announced that he will in fact come out with three more movies 
that will be the three previous stories that begin before the<A 
HREF="http://stwing.resnet.upenn.edu:8001/~jruspini/newfaq19.tx"> Star 
Wars movies</A>. For additional information please refer to the <A HREF=

Home Page</A>.

<LI><A NAME="QQ2"><H2>Where can I get Information on Political 
Science Courses offered next quarter, so I can Graduate?</H2></A> 
My answer is... Although one could wait until they print the schedule of 
classes and hand them out to students, there are severl advantages to 
understanding the UCI gopher system.  In the UCI gopher system there is a 
heading entitled "Student Information".  There you will find a <A
HREF= "gopher://uniedit.cwis.uci.edu:7026/00/new.cat/ss/pol"> 
schedule of classes </a> for the last couple years.  Then one can look up 
any classes they 
many be interestd in taking.  To find a discription of political Science 
classes you can look them up as well using Mosic, and looking into the 
<A HREF="http://www.socsci.uci.edu/pol/ugrad_program.html
"> Political 
Science department</a> Mosic 
page.  <p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ3"><H2>What is HTML and how do we make a document 
in HTML format?</H2></A>
My answer is...HTML is an <A 
HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/www_faq.html#sgmlhtml"> SGML</a> 
application for marking up documents for inclusion in the World Wide Web.
 HTML allows you to: 
Publish documents to the Internet in a platform independent format, Create
links to related works from your document, Include graphics and
multimedia data with your document, as well as link to non-World Wide Web 
information resources on the Internet.
For more information please refer to the ICS.1C home page under 
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/refs.html">references</a> or to
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu:80/~ics1c/doc/html-jpowell/"> Jane Powell's 
Paper</a> on defining HTML.

<LI><A NAME="QQ4"><H2>What is the World Wide Web?</H2></A>

My answer is...A set of nodes interconnected by links. Often, the set of 
all the nodes which are interconnected.
OK that is all fine and dandy but what does that really mean?
Basicallly, the <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/www.cacm.html"> 
"WEB"</A> it it the idea of a boundless information highway 
that allows one to connect to different documents using a specific
address system,<A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/url-primer.html"> 
(URL)</A>, as well as a special network protcol <A 
HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/www_faq.html#sgmlhtml"> (HTTP)</A>, 
and a markup language
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu:80/~ics1c/doc/html-jpowell/">(HTML)</a>.  

<p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ5"><H2>How can I find out information about the United 
Kingdom library system?</H2></A>
 My answer is... I will be traveling abroad next year to study through 
our own Education Abroad Program (EAP).  I will be conducting intensive 
research that will require me to be familar with not only the country but 
also with the <A HREF="http://www.blpes.ise.ac.uk.ibss"> UK library 
system</a> and how to obtain research information. I 
may end up studying at the University of Essex and click <A 
HREF="http://libwww.essex.ac.uk/"> here</a> for some additional information.
