<FONT SIZE=2><P>&#9;It�s June 20, awaking to a new foreign region with no sense of knowing where I am.  Taking a peak out the window of the Amtrak train seeing dull gray buildings and seemingly empty rusted tracks with a foggy atmosphere.  The tall powerful palm trees plunging into the dense foggy air and other unknown vegetation surrounding the Amtrak station has to be California.</P>
<P>&#9;The whole idea of this voyage across New Mexico through and over mountains to sunny California was to be enrolled in the American Indian Summer Institute in Computer Science.  A unique program, in which University of California selected only 21 students, Irvine staff members.  I am usually a little nervous entering a new community of people, but it�s for the better to further my knowledge of computers and social college skills.  I was a child and my father purchased an Apple IIe.  He could almost never get me away from &quot;my computer&quot;.   I know form being around this machine that I would love to have a career in computers.  I watch how computers over the years went from floppy disk boot to hard set disk boots and they kind of grew up with me.  As I grew older and smarter so did the computer evolve.  The computer probably had evolved in bigger steps, but at least I could keep up with the technology.  By the way I did have other leisure time and spent most of it being a &quot;nature boy&quot;.  I enjoy snow skiing, it is one of my favorite sports I like it because of the speed and the beautiful mountains and of course the wonderful white snow.  I also like fly fishing, hiking, and mountain bike riding downhill mostly.  I also play basketball and golf but am not an excellent player I would not even say average, but I find a little enjoyment in them.  I think everyone is here for a to find a purpose in life or posses a unique gift or maybe just have something special to give others.  I believe mine is somewhere in the computer field.  It has to because I show exciting or eager faces when operating a PC and am very willing to learn new systems and jump on the initiative when I have to.  I am totally focused and in one with a computer when I try to program in C++ using object oriented programming or in HTML using scripting. (I am still learning though)  I have over five years of operating and maintaining various computer systems and have a very strong commitment to developing a sound career in computer science.  Last summer I did an internship with USWest Communications as system analysis for a UNIX based client system.  I learned about a new field called problem management in this field we did plenty of research on the server outages and found out what was happening before it became really serious.  In doing this we began to stabilize the entire network system to a minimum outage occurrence and is still used today I believe.  I was introduced to many important directors and my social skills were tremendously increased.  I also was able to train future employees on problem management.  I appreciated my internship and experience.  I love times like that and have fun with computers that�s what I think what it takes to carry on in this field the positive influences.   I recently graduated from my two-year school with Associates of Applied Science in Computer Technology.  That is where I am now trying to continue my education with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science at a four-year school at New Mexico University. </P></FONT></BODY>
