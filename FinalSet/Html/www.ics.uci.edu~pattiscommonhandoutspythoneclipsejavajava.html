You may want to print these instructions before proceeding, so that you can
  refer to them while downloading and installing Java.
Or, just keep this document in your browser.
You should read each step completely before performing the action that it
  describes.
This document shows downloading and installing Java on Windows 7 in Fall 2013.

<h2>Java</h2><p>

The following instructions were composed for installing Sun Java 1.7.0_40
  (aka Java SE Development Kit (JDK) 7, Update 40).
<b>The version you download may be newer.</b>
Note: Java is already installed as part of Mac OS X, so no further installation
  is necessary if you have recently purchased one of these machines.
You can determine whether you have the right version by typing
<p>
<b><pre>  java -version</pre></b>
<p>
to the unix command prompt on Mac OS X;
the response should be something like <b>java version "1.7.0_40"</b>; it does
  not have to be this exact update.

<p>
The Java download requires about 1 MB of disk space; keep it on your machine,
  in case you need to reinstall Java.
When installed, Java requires about an additional 290 MB of disk space.
