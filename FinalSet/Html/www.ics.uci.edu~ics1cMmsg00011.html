As announced in class on Wednesday, Feb 1, we've been working on
a way to make your scores on assignments and quizzes available
on the network.  They will be coded by your student ID and you
will have to enter that ID in order to see your scores.
You will not be able to look at the scores of people whose
student ID you do not know and this service will be available
only from systems on the UCI network.

On the other hand, anyone with access to a system at UCI who
knows your student ID will be able to see your scores in the course.
This is an extension of the common practice on campus of posting listings
of scores by student ID, except that here the listing is on the
network (more people can see them than on a wall) and someone
must know your ID in order to request the scores (more restrictive
because people cannot scan the entire list).

If you DO NOT wish your scores to be available via this mechanism,
please reply "DO NOT POST MY SCORES" to this message by 3 p.m.,
Friday, February 3.

This service is already listed on the "ICS 1C Student Information" page 
   <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/student.html">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/student.html</A>
directly off the ICS 1C home page
   <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/</A>
It's already to go once we remove anyone who would not like their scores
available this way.
