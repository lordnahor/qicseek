<H2>Kevin A Heins</H2>

<p>I am a Ph.D. candidate currently in my fourth year at UCI, and working with Dr. Hal Stern. I received my M.S. in Statistics from
<br>UCI and my B.Sc. in Mathematics-Probability and Statistics from UCSD.</p>
<p>My current research focuses on identifying recurring patterns in behavioral sequences (multistate continuous-time point processes) 
<br>through probabilistic feature modeling. Our work has been motivated by attempts to classify fragmentation and unpredictability in
<br> mother-child interactions.</p>
