<div class=Section1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>Most modern Indian
cities strive to rise above ethnicity. Tell anybody who lives in <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Bombay</st1:place></st1:City> that he lives in a
Maharashtrian city and (unless of course, you are speaking to Bal Thackeray) he
will take immediate offence. We are cosmopolitan, he will say indigenously.
Tell a Delhiwalla that his is a Punjabi city (which, in many ways, it is) and
he will respond with much self-righteous nonsense about being the nation's
capital, about the international composition of the city's elite etc. And tell
a Bangalorean that he lives in a Kannadiga city and you'll get lots of
techno-gaff about the internet revolution and about how <st1:City w:st="on">Bangalore</st1:City>
is even more cosmopolitan than <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Bombay</st1:place></st1:City>.
<br>
<br>
But, the only way to understand what <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Calcutta</st1:place></st1:City>
is about is recognize that the city is essentially Bengali. What's more, no
Bengali minds you saying that. Rather, he is proud of the fact. <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Calcutta</st1:place></st1:City>'s strengths and
weaknesses mirror those of the Bengali character. It has the drawbacks: the
sudden passions, the cheerful chaos, the utter contempt for mere commerce, the
fiery response to the smallest provocation. And it has the strengths (actually,
I think of the drawbacks as strengths in their own way). <i><!--coloro:#CC0000--><span
style='color:#CC0000'><!--/coloro-->Calcutta embodies the Bengali love of
culture; the triumph of intellectualism over greed; the complete transparency
of all emotions, the disdain with which hypocrisy and insincerity are treated;
the warmth of genuine humanity; and the supremacy of emotion over all other
aspects of human existence.<br>
<br>
That's why <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Calcutta</st1:place></st1:City>
is not for everyone. You want your cities clean and green; stick to <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Delhi</st1:place></st1:City>. You want your
cities, rich and impersonal, go to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Bombay</st1:place></st1:City>.
You want them high-tech and full of draught beer, Bangalore's your place. But
if you want a city with a soul, come to Calcutta.<!--colorc--></span><!--/colorc--></i><br>
<br>
When I look back on the years I've spent in Calcutta - and I come back so many
times each year that I often feel I've never been away - I don't remember the
things that people remember about cities. When I think of London, I think of
the vast open spaces of Hyde Park. When I think of New York, I think of the
frenzy of Times Square. When I think of Tokyo, I think of the bright lights of
Shinjiku. And when I think of Paris, I think of the Champs Elysee. But when I
think of Calcutta, I never think of any one place. I don't focus on the
greenery of the maidan, the beauty of the Victoria Memorial, the bustle of
Burra Bazar or the splendour of the new Howrah 'Bridge'. I think of people.
Because, <i><!--coloro:#CC0000--><span style='color:#CC0000'><!--/coloro-->finally,
a city is more than bricks and mortars, street lights and tarred roads. A city
is the sum of its people. And who can ever forget -or replicate - the people of
Calcutta?<!--colorc--></span><!--/colorc--></i><br>
<br>
When I first came to live here, I was told that the city would grow on me. What
nobody told me was that the city would change my life. It was in Calcutta that
I learnt about true warmth; about simple human decency; about love and
friendship; about emotions and caring; about truth and honesty. I learnt other
things too. Coming from Bombay as I did, <i><!--coloro:#CC0000--><span
style='color:#CC0000'><!--/coloro-->it was a revelation to live in a city where
people judged each other on the things that really mattered; where they
recognized that being rich did not make you a better person - in fact, it might
have the opposite effect. I learnt also that if life is about more than just
money, it is about the things that other cities ignore<!--colorc--></span><!--/colorc--></i>;
about culture, about ideas, about art, and about passion. In Bombay, a man with
a relatively low income will salt some of it away for the day when he gets a
stock market tip. In Calcutta, a man with exactly the same income will not know
the difference between a debenture and a dividend. But he will spend his money
on the things that matter. Each morning, he will read at least two newspapers
and develop sharply etched views on the state of the world. Each evening, there
will be fresh (ideally, fresh-water or river) fish on his table. His children
will be encouraged to learn to dance or sing. His family will appreciate the
power of poetry. And for him, religion and culture will be in inextricably
bound together. <br>
<br>
Ah religion! Tell outsiders about the importance of Puja in Calcutta and
they'll scoff. Don't be silly, they'll say. Puja is a religious festival. And
Bengal has voted for the CPM since 1977. How can godless Bengal be so hung up
on a religions festival? <i><!--coloro:#CC0000--><span style='color:#CC0000'><!--/coloro-->I
never know how to explain them that to a Bengali, religion consists of much
more than shouting Jai Shri Ram or pulling down somebody's mosque. It has
little to do with meaningless ritual orsinister political activity.<br>
<br>
The essence of Puja is that all the passions of Bengal converge: emotion,
culture, the love of life, the warmth of being together, the joy of
celebration, the pride inartistic ex-pression and yes, the cult of the goddess.<!--colorc--></span><!--/colorc--></i><br>
<br>
It may be about religion. But is about much more than just worship. In which
other part of India would small, not particularly well-off localities, vie with
each other to produce the best pandals? Where else could puja pandals go beyond
religion to draw inspiration from everything else? In the years I lived in
Calcutta, the pandals featured Amitabh Bachchan, Princes Diana and even Saddam
Hussain! Where else would children cry with the sheer emotional power of
Dashimi, upset that the Goddess had left their homes? Where else would the
whole city gooseflesh when the dhakis first begin to beat their drums? Which other
Indian festival - in any part of the country - is so much about food, about
going from one roadside stall to another, following your nose as it trails the
smells of cooking? <br>
<br>
<i><!--coloro:#CC0000--><span style='color:#CC0000'><!--/coloro-->To understand
Puja, you must understand Calcutta. And to understand Calcutta , you must
understand the Bengali. It's not easy. <br>
<br>
Certainly, you can't do it till you come and live here, till you let Calcutta
suffuse your being, invade your bloodstream and steal your soul. But once you
have, you'll love Calcutta forever. Wherever you go,a bit of Calcutta will go
with you. I know, because it's happened to me. And every Puja, I am overcome by
the magic of Bengal. It's a feeling that'll never go away.<!--colorc--></span><!--/colorc--></i><!--sizec--></span></p>
