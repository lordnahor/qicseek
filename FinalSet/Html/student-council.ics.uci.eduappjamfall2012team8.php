			<div class="description cms">
				<p>Our Android application, entitled ZotPark, provides users with a convenient way to navigate the   confusing parking permit system at UC Irvine. ZotPark determines and displays parking areas the user can park in based on permit type. If users so desire, ZotPark can determine and display extra parking lots and structures the user can park in, depending on the time of day. Once the user has selected their permit type, ZotPark displays the location of available parking areas on a map. From this view, the user can select to view navigational directions from the user's current location to the parking area they would like to reach. Alternatively, the user can store a home address for ZotPark to use as a starting point for directions. The user also has the option of accessing an information page for each parking area from the map display. This page informs the user of any special conditions that are required to park in said parking area, as well as general information about their parking permit.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="description cms">
				<p> On the first day of our adventure this week, n00bz sat pondering ideas for applications that would help UCI students academically, socially, and professionally. As we shuffled through numerous ideas along the lines of social networking, blogging, and posting pictures, we asked ourselves, "What is something that UCI students complain about?" And instantly, "Parking!" was shouted out. That was our breakthrough; we would make an app that made parking permits less confusing! I remember getting my parking permit, and talking to the people in the booth for 20 minutes, and still leaving confused. The permit said, "Lots 17A, 18R, CT. Valid in the Anteater Parking Structure (APS) ONLY Monday - Friday between 5:00pm and 8:00am, and all day Saturday and Sunday." What??? And on top of that, it took me 20 minutes driving up and down East Peltason trying to find lot 17A (it is tucked away on the other side of the bridge, and not reachable directly from Palo Verde Apartments or East Peltason). Our app will tell people where the lots are, and when their specific permits are valid!  </p>

			</div>
			<div class="description cms">
				<p>We began our work by determining what kind of application the UCI student body needed, and more importantly, would enjoy using. After the deliberation of several ideas, we settled on developing an application that would help users navigate the confusing system of permit parking here at UCI and avoid receiving expensive parking citations. We drew up documentation for how the app would work and what features it would have. After determining this, we embarked on creating a database that would serve our purposes and contain every possible combination of permits, parking areas and times. After creating this database, we began to create the code for the application. After hitting several setbacks over the weekend in determining how to write the code for the features we wanted, we finally had a breakthrough and created a usable, working app. After coding a basic framework, we put some final touches to make the UI experience pleasant for users.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="description cms">
				<p>One of our biggest challenges this past week was being able to get our team to meet up all together; busy schedules, emergencies, and work were not cooperating with us.
					<br />Not only could we not get together sometimes, but our entire team is new to coding (hence our name, "n00bz"). Three of us are first years, and two second years. However, we pulled through with research, hard work, and stress.
					<br />For quite some time, we could not figure out how to format our databases.
					<br />The information itself was also difficult to interpret (this is the point of our app - to make the parking information on certain permits less confusing).
					<br />We had problems making a pop up in Google API, and had to write our own code and overlay it.
					<br />There wasn't very good documentation for Google API.
