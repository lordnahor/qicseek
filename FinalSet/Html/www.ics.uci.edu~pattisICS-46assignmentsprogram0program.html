<td width ="80%">
This "programming assignment" is designed to ensure that you know how to
  use -at least in a cookbook way-
  <b>Eclipse</b> (for editing, running, and debugging C++ programs, after
    installing the course library),
 <b>GoogleTest</b> (and driver programs, for testing and locating errors in
    code), and <b>Checkmate</b> for submitting programs for grading.
<p>
You will start this programming assignment similarly to others this quarter.
<ul>
<li>First you will download, unzip an Eclipse Start Project Folder.
<p>
<li>Second, you will start Eclipse, create a C++ project (using the downloaded
      project folder, as the existing source) and then configure the project for
      use with the <b>courselib</b> and <b>googletestlib</b> libraries (as you
      will for most programming assignments).
<p>
<li>Third, you will use a driver program and GoogleTest to test code that I
      have provided in the start project folder (and later for code you write).
<p>
<li>Fourth, when you have corrected the program, you will submit its
      <b>.hpp</b> file using the Checkmate submission system.
</ul>
For all later assignments, I will not be providing as much code as I do in
  this assignment, because the focus of this assignment is using tools,
  not writing code; the focus of the later assignments is writing code
 using the tools that you are learning in this assignment.
<b>But</b> that assumes that you learn how to use these tools now.
There is actually just one error in this code, and this write-up will
  detail where it is and how to fix it.
So the purpose of this assignment is not to fix the error, but instead to become
  familiar with the tools you will use throughout the quarter.
<p>
I encourage you to work on this assignment in pairs, with someone in
  your lab section.
This quarter you can work in pairs on all the programming assignments.
Normally, when you work in a pair, <b>only one student should submit the
  assignment</b>, which should contain both students' names appearing in the
  comments at the top of each submitted <b>.hpp</b> or <b>.cpp</b> file.
But for this assignment, I want each student to submit the program using
  the Checkmate submission system, so I'll know that every student knows how
  to use it.
<p>
You may want to print this document and carefully read it, marking any parts
  that contain important information (for review before you turn in the file);
  you might want to save the copy you marked-up.
This is the first quarter that I am using this document, so please report any
  problems (even just typos) to me.
I expect you to read this entire document and perform all the operations it
  describes...maybe even more than once.

<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%"><b>Download and Unzip</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
Download (onto your desktop) and unzip the following 
  <a href="program0.zip">Eclipse Start Project Folder</a>.
Generally if you right-click the <b>.zip</b> file, one of
  the optionis available will unzip the file: <b>Izarc</b>
  and <b>WinZip</b> are two common programs, both further
  specify an <b>Extract [to] Here</b> option.
If you have any problems ask one of the staff for help.
<p>
The resulting unzipped folder has contains a <b>src</b> folder (as
  all Eclipse/C++ projects do) in which are nested the <b>.hpp</b> and
  <b>.cpp</b> files for the programming project.
This project contans five files.
The <b>src</b> folder contains four files.
<ul>
  <li>The <b>linear_array_queue.hpp</b> file implements a queue data type
       (but with one bug).
  <li>The <b>driver.cpp</b> and <b>driver_queue.cpp</b> files, which we use
        to test drive the <b>LinearArrayQueue</b>
  <li>The <b>test_queue.cpp</b> file which contains a GoogleTest for any
        implementation of a queue.
</ul>
There is also a file named <b>load.txt</b>, outside the <b>src</b> folder,
  which is used with the <b>l</b> command in the driver.

<!-- Start Eclipse, Create a Project, Install Libraries -->

<a name="eclipse">

<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="0" rules="none" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%"><b>Start Eclipse, Create a C++<br>
                    Project, and Configure<br>
                    Eclipse to use the courselib</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
Next you need to start Eclipse and create a project using the project folder
  you just downloaded as the existing source.
If you have not already installed a <b>courselib</b> project in Eclipse, follow
  the <b>Courselib Installation</b> instructions at the start of
  <a href="../../../common/modules46/courselib.html">Courselib Installation</a>.
Once you have correctly created a <b>courselib</b> project and built it,
  follow the <b>Creating a Project that Uses the Courselib</b> instructions
  later in this document for creating a new project and configuring it to use
  the <b>courselib</b>.
For uniformity, use the name <b>Program0</b> for your project's name.
I did these operations from memory in 2 minutes: if it takes you longer
  than 5 minutes, practice more.
<p>
Later in this handout you will be instructed to install/use the
  <b>googletest</b> library, which is not needed yet.
For most projects later in the quarter, when you create the project you should
  immediately configure it to use both libraries.
<p>
The <b>LinearArrayQueue</b> files in this project defines almost correct
  class that implements the behavior of a queue data type: it is a simpler to
  understand but less efficient version of the <b>ArrayQueue</b> class in the
  <b>courselib</b>.
You will be implementing lots of (abstract) data types, like this one, during
  the quarter.
A queue is a simple FIFO data type, adhering to the First-in First-out order
  property.
Queues enqueue values to their rear and dequeue values from their front, so
  these are the two "hot spots" that must be efficiently accessed in any data
  structures that implements a queue.

<p>
We can implement the queues data type efficiently by using either an array or
  linked list data structure.
The queue type implementation in this programming assignment,
  <b>LinearArrayQueue</b>, declares the required instance variables and needed
  methods using an array data structure: the front of the queue is always
  stored at index 0; the rear is stored at a higher index in the array.
Using a linear array is conceptually simple to understand and program,
  but it has a slower-than-necessary <b>dequeue</b> operation (when compared
  with using a circular array data structure used in the <b>ArrayQueue</b>
  class, which we will discuss later in lecture): it always requires
  looping through an array.
When all the necessary libraries are installed, this class compiles and can
  be tested in the driver and via GoogleTest; but it is incorrect, so it
  results in a few execution/run-time errors.

<!-- Run Driver -->

<a name="driver">
<hr align="left" width="33%">
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="0" rules="none" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%"><b>Run the Driver</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
Each data type that we will discuss this quarter has a "driver" program that
  allows us to "drive it": to call (test) each of its methods and observe the
  results.
The driver for queues is in the class named <b>DriverQueue</b> stored in the
  <b>driver_queue.cpp</b> file in the <b>src</b> folder in <b>courselib</b>.
<p>
To run this driver program on the <b>LinearArrayQueue</b> I have already done
  the following (but you will have to do something similar in later projects
  so carefully observe these changes here).
<ul>
  <li>Copy the <b>driver_queue.cpp</b> file from the <b>src</b> folder in
        <b>courselib</b> to the current project.
  <li>In the <b>driver_queue.cpp</b> file, change the <b>typedef</b> in line 13
      from
        <b><pre>typedef ics::ArrayQueue<std::string> QueueType;</pre></b>
      to
        <b><pre>typedef ics::LinearArrayQueue<std::string> QueueType;</pre></b>
  <li>In the <b>driver.cpp</b> file, ensure the <b>#include</b> on line 1 
        refers to <b>"driver_queue.cpp"</b> and ensure the definition on
        line 4 refers to <b>ics::DriverQueue d;</b>
</ul>
Again, when a file name appears in your project's <b>src</b> folder and also in
the <b>courselib</b>'s <b>src</b> folder, the one appearing in the project will
be the one used.
<p>
Because I already made all these changes in the downloaded project folder,
  just build and run this program: the <b>main</b> in <b>driver.cpp</b>
  constructs a <b>driver_queue</b> object that tests the
   <b>LinearArrayQueue</b> implementation of a queue data type.
<p>
The program should now start running in the <b>Console</b> tab at the bottom
  of Eclipse.
The console window will display the queue being manipulated (now empty)
 and the following menu of options that you can use to call/test each queue
 method.
<!--- </td></tbody></table> --->

<tbody>
<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%"><b>&nbsp;</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
--->
Note that this driver tests a queue that stores <b>std::string</b> values.
You must enter a string to test any Mutator (Command) or Accessor (Query)
  method.
Of special note is the <b>it</b> command, which constructs and tests an
  iterator for this queue: it has its own submenu of options applicable
  for iterators (which is the same for every data type).
<p>
Note that the queue being manipulated prints before the menu using its
  <b>.str()</b> queury, that starts with the data type (here <b>queue</b>)
  followed by the enqueued values in brackets.
Afterwards are all the data members in the implementing class and their values.
In an <b>LinearArrayQueue</b>...
<ul>
  <li>...the <b>length</b> is the length of its array.
  <li>...the <b>used</b> is the number of array indexes containing value values
        (always <= <b>length</b>).
  <li>...the <b>mod_count</b> counts the number of modifications made to the
        queue since its construction.
</ul>
The <b>&lt;</b> command shows just the <b>queue[]</b> part of the <b>.str()</b>
  command.
This relationship is true for how <b>&lt;&lt</b> and <b>.str()</b> are
  related for all classes: the <b>.str()</b> version produces more detailed
  information that is often used for debugging.
<p>
Issue the <b>m</b>, <b>s</b>, and <b>p</b> commands to query the state of
  the empty queue.
The driver should show the following.

The <b>peek</b> method returns a reference to the queue's first value (which
  the driver prints); but it cannot work correctly on an empty queue.
Notice what is printed instead: the thrown exception
  (<b>EmptyError</b>) and the <b>Class::method</b> that raised the error.
Thus, the driver just ignores this command and we can continue driving the
  <b>LinearArrayQueue</b> class.
<p>
Next issue the <b>e</b> command and enqueue <b>test1</b> when prompted.
This method returns the number of values enqueued to the queue
  (for queues, which can contain duplicate values, it always returns
  <b>1</b>; for sets, which cannot contain duplicate values, this method
  may return <b>0</b> if the value is already in the set).
The queue now prints (before the next menu) as
<b><pre>queue q = queue[test1]:rear(length=1,used=1,mod_count=1)</pre></b>
which shows...
<ul>
  <li>...the queue now contains the value <b>test1</b> (and the rear of the
        queue is indicated by <b>:rear</b>: this annotation makes more sense
        when the queue contains more than one value).
  <li>...the length of the array holding the queue values has increased to
        <b>1</b>.
  <li>...the queue is using <b>1</b> value in the array.
  <li>...the queue has been mutated <b>1</b> time since being constructed:
        the previous accessors/queries are not counted.
</ul>
<p>
Next issue the <b>e</b> command again and enqueue <b>test2</b> when prompted.
The queue now prints (before the next menu) as
<b><pre>queue q = queue[test1,test2]:rear(length=2,used=2,mod_count=2)</pre></b>
Order is important in queues: the earlier a value is enqueued, the earlier it
  appears in the array.
Notice that both <b>length</b> and <b>used</b> increase to <b>2</b>.
<p>
Next issue the <b>e</b> command again and enqueue <b>test3</b> when prompted.
The queue now prints (before the next menu) as
<b><pre>queue q = queue[test1,test2,test3]:rear(length=4,used=3,mod_count=3)</pre></b>
Notice that <b>length</b> increases to <b>4</b> while <b>used</b> increases to
  <b>3</b>: generally if there is not enough room in an array its length is
  doubled.
The driver should show the following.
<p>

<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%"><b>&nbsp;</b></td>
<td width ="80%">

Next issue the <b>d</b> command which should dequeue the value at the front of
  the queue.
It correctly prints <b>dequeue = test1</b>, but when it prints the queue
  before the next menu, it appears as
<b><pre>queue q = queue[test2,test3,test3]:rear(length=4,used=3,mod_count=4)</pre></b>
This result is <b>incorrect</b> because <b>test3</b> now appears in two
  different queue/array locations (it was shifted one to the left, but still
  appears at the end).
In fact, if you issue the <b>d</b> command again, it prints
  <b>dequeue = test2</b> but now <b>test3</b> appears in all three positions in
  the array.
<p>
Next issue the <b>x</b> command (whose <b>clear</b> method is <b>void</b> and
  returns -and the driver prints- no result).
It will correctly clear the queue, which prints before the next menu as.
<b><pre>queue q = queue[]:rear(length=4,used=0,mod_count=5)</pre></b>

So, using this driver, we can call/test all the methods in the
  <b>LinearArrayQueue</b> class, looking for incorrect behavior.
<p>
If we see errors in the output, to help us debug any errors that we find we 
  can...
<ul>
  <li>...add code into the driver to have it print itermediate results.
  <li>...add code into the <b>LinearArrayClass</b> and rerun the driver.
  <li>...use the debugger to set breakpoints in our methods and execute/step
       through the code while observing how it changes its state 
</ul>
A later section of this document illustrates using the driver with the debugger.
For now, continue to explore and experiment with the other commands in this
 driver, and <b>DO NOT</b> fix the error in <b>delete</b> yet.
The <b>l</b> command allows quickly enqueuing a series of values read from
  a file (the default it <b>load.txt</b>, which is included with this project).
Try the <b>it</b> commands to better understand what we can do with iterators.
<p>
If you ever find your program in an <b>infinite loop</b>, you can terminate the
  program manually by clicking the Red Square on the top of the console
  window (the leftmost icon).
Then you can click the X or Xx icons (to the right of the Red Square) to clear
  the the console.
<p>
To rerun the driver, click the right-pointing triangle icon
  <img src="images/run.jpg"></img>.
When Eclipse <b>builds</b> a project it compiles all its files.
When Eclipse <b>runs</b> a project it links these compiled files and the
  code in configured libraries and runs the single <b>main</b> function it
  finds (if it finds none or more than one, it will report an error).
So we can build but not run the <b>courselib</b> project because it is a
  library and has no <b>main</b> method to run.

<!-- Run GoogleTest Test -->

<a name="junit">
<hr align="left" width="33%">
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="0" rules="none" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%"><b>Run the GoogleTest<br> Unit Test</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
Each data type that we will discuss this quarter also has a GoogleTest test.
While a driver for a class is code that allows us to manually test its methods
  and observe their results, a GoogleTest is code that automatically tests the
  class and report its results.
It produces output to show clearly which tests passed and which tests failed;
  and for the failed tests, it produces more detailed information about how the
  test failed.
When the code is modified (hopefully corrected), it is very easy to rerun all
  the tests and observe the changes (hopefully more/all test are passed now)
  automatically.
<p>
To run the GoogleTest program, we must change the <b>program0</b> project as
  follows.
<ul>
  <li>Configure the project for use with the <b>googletestlib</b> library.
      If you have not already installed a <b>googletestlib</b> in
        Eclipse, follow the <b>Googlettest Installation</b> instructions at the
        <a href="../../../common/online.html">Course Software</a> page ("Full"
        or "Quick for PC").
      Once you have correctly installed the <b>googletestlib</b>,
        follow the <b>Creating a Project that Uses the Googletestlib</b>
        instructions later in the ("Quick for PC") document for creating a new
        project and configuring it to use the <b>googletestlib</b>.
      I did these operations from memory in 2 minutes: if it takes you longer
       than 5 minutes, practice more.
  <p>
  <li>Uncomment the <b>main</b> function at the bottom of the
        <b>test_queue.cpp</b> file (actually uncomment the entire file).
      Likewise we must comment-out the <b>main</b> function in the
        <b>driver.cpp</b> file (actually commen-out the entire file).
      Only one <b>main</b> function can exist in a C++ project, because there
        can be only one starting point for the program being run.
</ul>
Before running this project, examine the code in the <b>test_queue</b> file.
It consists of 12 separate tests, each which should be readable and
  understandable if you understand what queues are about.
Now run the GoogleTest.
The result is illustrated below.
Check the bottom of GoogleTest's output first
It summarizes the number of passed tests and names the failed tests: you can
  examine these failed tests in more detail, if they are present.

<p>
<h3>Failure Modes</h3>
<p>
There are two major failure modes possible in each GoogleTest.
<ul>
  <li>An assertion failure in a test means that the code being tested did not
        meet its requirements.
      GoogleTest will print useful information about the failure (just what it
        prints is based on which assertion failed).
      In the figure above, both the <b>dequeue1</b> and <b>dequeue2</b> tests
        failed (on lines 138 and 150 respectively).
  <p>
  <li>An exception failure in a test means that the code being tested threw an
       exception.
      GoogleTest will print information about the exception (although often
        it just states an unexpected exception was thrown..
      In the figure above, no unexpected exceptions were thrown.
  <p>
</ul>
In addition, it is also possible that incorrect code will exhibit a failure
  mode that GoogleTest cannot detect and report: an infinite loop.
In such a case GoogleTest will stop printing information in the console
  after starting to run a test.
If the <b>enqueue</b> test caused an infinite loop, the console might look
  as follows.

<!---<tbody>
<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%"><b>&nbsp;</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
--->
If you ever find your program in an <b>infinite loop</b>, you can terminate the
  program manually by clicking the Red Square on the top of the console
  window (the leftmost icon).
Then you can click the X or Xx icons (to the right of the Red Square) to clear
  the the console.
In such a case, you would have to manually stop the program as described above
  (clicking the Red Square in the Console window).
In the console with the original test, the Red Square is greyed-out, because
  the GoogleTest test has already terminated.
<p>
You have a choice of either commenting-out the test code (so GoogleTest won't
  run this test) or keeping the test and immediately debugging the code that is
  causing it to loop infinitely.
If you choose the former, remember to uncomment the test code eventually.
<p>
<h3>Debugging</h3>
<p>
Here is a short but <b>important</b> list of four stategies that we can employ
  when our code fails, to try to understand the cause of the problem (and then
  hopefully correct it).
First, examine the line of code in the test at which the failure was detected
  (which is printed in the console) and the information it displays related to
  the failure.
<ol>
  <li>Examining the code using the failure information as a guide.
  <li>Add arbitrary C++ code in the GoogleTest test to print information.
  <li>Use the debugger to set a breakpoint before the failed assertion, 
        and then examine relevant state.
   <li>Use the driver to duplicate/explore the problem manually.
</ol>
<p>
<h3>Tests</h3>
<p>
Generally, each public method has its own GoogleTest test, reflecting the
  semantics (meaning) of what the methods in a class do.
It is good to be able to read and understand the GoogleTest code (and you will
  get more experience doing so during the quarter) because it can be useful to
  add debugging code to it: typically printing the state of variables just
  before a test/assertion failed.
Mostly GoogleTest code intersperses calls to the methods of the class being
  tested with assertions about what the results of those method-calls should
  be: a test method fails when any assertions in it fail.
<p>
The tests are peformed in the order in whicht hey appear.
I try to arrange my tests from the simple to the more complex.
Sometimes bugs causing failures in the earlier tests also cause failures in
  the latter ones.
So an important debugging strategy is to concentrate on and correct the earlier
  bugs: at best the later bugs might automatically disappear; at worst it will
  be easier to understand/correct the later/more complicated bugs after you have
  understood/corrected the earlier/simpler ones.
<p>
Also note that each test is abandoned when the first assertion fails; it 
  doesn't test subsequent assertions.
This strategy leads to two interesting consequences
<ul>
  <li>The output is not cluttered with multiple failure messages for
        multiple assertions in each test: instead each test either passes or
        fails presenting details on only the first failure.
  <p>
  <li>Expect that a test might still fail after you make corrections to your
        code; but the correction should cause a failure later in the test:
        e.g., an earlier assertion in the test that failed should now pass,
        even if later assertions (which were not reached because of the earlier
        failure) now are tested and fail.
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Debugging Examples</h3>
<p>
Here we will examine the four strategies for debugging stated above.
The first failure was on line 138 in the <b>dequeue1</b> test.
The entire test appears as follows, with its line numbers.
<b><pre>  130 TEST_F(QueueTest, dequeue1) {
  131   QueueType q;
  132   q.enqueue("a");
  133   q.enqueue("b");
  134   q.enqueue("c");
  135   ASSERT_EQ("a",q.dequeue());
  136   ASSERT_EQ("b",q.dequeue());
  137   ASSERT_EQ("c",q.dequeue());
  138   ASSERT_TRUE(q.empty());
  139   ASSERT_EQ(0, q.size());
  140 }</pre></b>
The error states that the queue was expected to be empty but it was not.
<ol>
<li>Our first stategy would be just to look at the code in the
      <b>LinearArrayQueue</b/b> class.
    We will see that the the <b>empty</b> method returns <b>false</b> when
      <b>used</b> is not <b>0</b>.
    <b>used</b> is initialized to <b>0</b>, and if we enqueue three values and
      then dequeue three values it should return to <b>0</b>.
    Since the <b>enqueue</b> test worked, we can focuse on the <b>dequeue</b>
       method to learn why <b>used</b> was not decremented to <b>0</b>.
<p>

<li>Our second stategy would be to add some code in the <b>dequeue1</b> test to
      help us understand why the <b>empty</b> method returns <b>false</b>.
    We could, for example, print the size and even the queue itself (using the
      more verbose <b>.str()</b> function, using the  following code.
    <b><pre>std::cout << "in deqeue1: size = " << q.size << , ", queue = " << q.str() << std::endl;</pre></b>
    I highly recommend putting textual material in these debugging displays, to
      identify them: as we put more and more debugging displays into a program
      (which we typically do when debugging) they can become confusing.
    If we put this code right before the line 138 it would display
    <b><pre>in deqeue1: size = 3, queue = queue[c,c,c]:rear(length=4,used=3,mod_count=6)</pre></b>
    The queue is supposed to be empty, but its <b>used</b> is <b>3</b>
<p>

<li>Our third strategy is to use the debugger to set a breakpoint before the
      failed assertion, and then examine relevant state.
    The debugger in Eclipse/C++ operates similarly to the Eclipse/Python.
    We can set unconditional and conditional breakpoints, single step (into,
      over, and out of) code, observe the values of global and local variables.
    Experiment with the debugger until you know how to use it to perform common
      debugging tasks (like those indicated below).
    <p>
    Try these steps.
    <ul>
       <li>Set an unconditional breakpoint on line 138; recall that when a line
             has a breakpoint, execution stops <b>before</b> the line is
             executed.
       <li>Launch the debugger by clicking the bug icon 
             <img src="images/debug.jpg"></img>.
           When the <b>Confirm Perspective Switch</b> popup window appears,
             click <b>Yes</b>: it will switch from the <b>C++</b> perpsective
             to the <b>debug</b> perspective.
       <li>Click the resume icon <img src="images/resum.jpg"></img> to start
             execution of the GoogleTest program.
       <li>The debugger stops the program before executing line 138 and shows
             the following
           <p>
           <img src="images/rundebugging.jpg"></img>.
           <p>
       <li>For now, just terminate the debugger and return to the <b>C/C++</b>
             perspective
    </ul>
<p>

<li>Our fourth strategy would be to use the driver to duplicate/explore the
      problem manually.
    Actually in our discussion of the driver we saw that when we enqueued
      three values and dequeued all three, the result was a queue with the
      last enqueued values stored in all indexes.
</ol>

In fact, both test failures relate to a single bug: the <b>used</b> variable
  was not decremented in the <b>dequeue</b> method: I commented-out the code
  at line 162 of the <b>linear_array_queue.hpp</b> file.
Remember that sometimes fixing one bug will cause many failed tests to pass.
<p>
Restore this line of code (uncomment it) to fix the error.
Now rerun this GoogleTest test and verify that there are no more failures.
<p>

Both errors and failures indicate that the code is incorrect and should be
  fixed.
Of course, we must be careful because it is possible that an assertion is
  incorrect: e.g., an assertion asserts the size of the queue is some number
  but based on the <b>add</b>/<b>remove</b> methods called in the GoogleTest test
  it should be some other number.
While you should mostly believe the GoogleTest tests I distribute, there is always
  the possibility that I have made a mistake.
If you look closely at a GoogleTest test and don't understand why some failing
  assertion should be true, please contact me to resolve the problem

<b>You are responsible for backing up your work frequently</b>.
<p>
Whenever you have updated your code (and when you have finished an assignment)
  you should backup/save the entire project folder on a USB drive.
Even if you are using your own computer, you should still backup your work.
Probably it is best to zip the entire project folder (which makes it smaller
  and also speeds up copying -which depends as much on how many files you
  copy as on the size of the files).
If you are on a lab machine, you can also backup/save this zipped project
  folder on your Unix file space.
<p>
If you need to restore a project folder, follow these steps.
<ol>
  <li>Unzip the project folder.
  <li>Delete its <b>.cproject</b> and <b>.project</b> file.
  <li>Delete its <b>.settings</b> and <b>Debug</b> folders.
  <li>Recreate the project and configure all its libraries.
</ol>
<p>
Practice doing everything in this lab over and again, until you are familiar
  with all these skills and can do them without reading the directions.
You will save yourself much time later in the quarter (when time is really
  important) if you spend some time now (when things aren't so rushed)
  mastering this material.
