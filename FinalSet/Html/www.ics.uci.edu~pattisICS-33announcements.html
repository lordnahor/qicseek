  #8: 2/3/14<br>
  Quiz #3 Graded
</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
The TA has graded (and I have recorded the grades for) Quiz #3.
The class average was about 22 (or about 86%); the median was 23 (or about
  92%).
Look at your returned work carefully; if your score was below 20 (which is 80%)
  you might want to review this quiz with me or a TA.
Material similar to this will be on the first written exam.
<p>
We graded just the Checkmate submitted material and will not be returning
  the printed quizzes.
There is a test driver with <b>bsc</b> files that we used to grade your work.
To see how your quiz was graded (and the driver/<b>bsc</b> files), download and
   unzip
   <a href="solutions/quiz3gradesstudents.zip">assignment grades/test</a>.
After you examine your graded work in class on Monday, please download the 
  <b>Grades(zipped .xlsm file)</b> from the course web and ensure that I have
  computed and entered your grade correctly (I'll be entering thousands of
  grades for students in my course this quarter, so even if I'm 99% accurate,
  I'm likely to record some incorrect grades.
Note that all grades are recorded as integral values: I always round up
  (e.g., a quiz score of 22.5 is recorded as 23).
<p>
If you believe that the TA has graded any of your work incorrectly, I encourage
  you to see him immediately about the discrepancy (in the case of programming
  assignments, you will always see your TA too).
Such a discussion can have only positive outcomes: either he will agree with you
 that you deserve more credit (and, we do want you to receive all the credit
 that you are due), or you will come to understand the question, program, or
  solution better.
This is certainly a win-win situation.
In any case, carefully examine my solution before you come to see him.
Also, because of the size of this class, if you have a grading issue, you must
  bring it to TAs attention within a week of when I return the materials.
<p>
Generally exams (written and programming) and quizzes are graded more closely
  than programming assignments.
If the average on any testing instrument is less than 75%, the column for
  that instrument will show the number of normalization points: the number of
  points each student would have needed to earn to have that instrument's
  average be 75%: these number of points are then added to the sum of the
  points for each student (in a later column).
This is the only curving I do in grading.
On this testing instrument (and typically most others, except the written
  exams), the normalization points are 0.

  #7: 1/29/13<br>
  Programming Assignment #1 Graded
</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
Programming Assignment #1 has been graded.
There are two files that you should download, unzip, and examine to understand
  you performance on this assignment and cumulative performance in this class.
<p>
<ul>
<li>The first stores the
   <a href="solutions/program1gradesstudents.zip">assignment grades</a>, a
   zipped Excel file that details how each student was graded on this
   instrument: why points were deducted.
You will see the deducted points in cells.
If you hover over a commented cell (those with a red-triangle in the cell's
  upper-right hand corner) you will see a comment that explains why the points
  were deducted.
This file is is sorted by unique ID.
This file is is sorted by your Unique ID (which derived from your UCI ID; see
  message #4 below for details).
<p>
<li>The second file to examine is the grades spreadsheet that is available from
   the index on the course web: it records all the grades for all the testing
   instruments that I assign over the quarter.
It is sorted likewise.
<p>
You will notice that in the second spreadsheet all numbers are rounded up to
  integers: so receiving a 57.5 on the first spreadsheet will translate to a 58
  on the second one.
We will use this same process for recording all grades during the quarter.
</ul>
<p>
This assignment was designed to test if you have mastered the standard built-in
  data types in Python: tuple, list, set, and dict (and variants) -and
  iterators over these data types (including comprehensions).
You should have found it interesting that so many different problems can be
  solved compactly with the same tools: these data types and iteration.
<p>
The class average was 46 (or about 77%) and the median was 51 (or about 85%);
  last quarter these numbers were 47 and 51.
There were 41% As, 18% Bs, 10% Cs, and 32% Ds and Fs.
Only a few submissions were early.
<p>
<b>IMPORTANT</b>
If you believe that we recorded one or more answers incorrectly, please
  see your TA during lab hours and tell him what you think the differences are.
Please read the comments in the <b>assignment grades</b> spreadsheet carefully
  <b>before</b> contacting your TA and ensure you understand the correct
  answers.
He will then re-examine issue, possibly asking you for more information if there
  is still confusion, or talking to you during the lab meeting.
If there is a difference, he will email me a revised summary about
  your program, and cc a copy to you.
I will update the grades spreadsheet as appropriate (it might take a bit of
  time for all these events to cumulate in a changed grade).
If you feel there is still a problem after talking to the TA, please
  contact me (but always contact the TA first).

Generally most students did well on the first two problems; we deducted points
  for overly-complicated code.
For Problem 2 we deducted points for calling <b>l.count</b> which is not needed
 (calling this method is slow and the solution can be computed by
  initializing/updating only the dictionary.
For Problem 3, we deducted points for not using a <b>defaultdict</b>: they
  simplify many problems and you should learn how to use them.
Problem 4 showed the widest range of scores: the exception should show all the
  information described in the problem (and the code should print nothing
  itself); the algorithm is simply stated as a while loop updating the single
  key we are advancing to compute the result (using the reachable code from the
  programming assignment is overly complicated).
<!---
<p>
If you scored very low on this quiz, you should ask yourself whether you are
  properly prepared for this course (or whether it was lack or time, or some
  other issue that causes a poor performance).
Possibly you barely passed ICS-32, but really don't understand the material or
  how to program as well as most of the other students.
If you do not think you are well-prepared, you should find a way to improve
  your Python skills before taking this course.
Why?
Well, you might flunk this course (technically anything less than a C and you
  cannot continue with other courses) and have to take it over; but most
  students who flunk a course flunk it because they didn't learn what they
  needed in the prerequisite course; if that is true you might take this course
  multiple times and still flunk it, because your Python skills aren't what they
  need to be.
Even worse, if you squeak by and barely pass this course, you are now done with
  a year of programming but haven't learned what you need to thrive in later
  classes at UCI: this is really a worse outcome than flunking,
  because it sets you up for failure further in your studies, when it is even
  more difficult to get caught up.
I'm happy to talk to students who feel ill-prepared for this course and would
  like to explore their options.

This assignment was designed to test you on whether you have mastered the
   basics of using Python in Eclipse, the Eclipse Debugger perspective, and
   batch-self-check files in the <b>driver.py</b> module (in <b>courselib</b>).
 It was also designed to see if you could follow instructions and ask
    questions: more on that below.
<p>
The class average was 27 (or about 92%) and the median was 29 (or about 97%).
There were 72% As, 11% Bs, 6% Cs, and 141% Ds and Fs of those student who turned
  in any work.
The assignment was not meant to be hard, but it was not trivial either, and
  there were many opportunities to lose points.
<p>
Let me talk about what will probably be the most contentious single point of
  the 1,000 points that this course is worth (thus .1% of the grade): the point
  was lost by 30 students (or about 30%).
I took off 1 point if you corrected the misspelling <b>Inteprxter</b> (and
  two points if you didn't have either spelling: in this second case you
  obvious failed to meet the specifications because you did not print what was
  required).
When some students hear about this point deduction, their heads explode and
  they cannot believe that I am taking off a point for correcting what you
  thought was my mistake.
But... I am trying to foster an atmosphere where nothing is taken for granted in
  the instructions I give: if anything seems confusing or plain wrong, I should
  be questioned about it -preferably in public, so others can learn about the
  problem and the correction.
For some background, check out Mr. Lill in the course overview.
<p>
Some students did ask me outside of class if they should correct the
  misspelling, and I told them no; some students asked me by email if they
  should correct the misspelling, and I told them no; no student asked on the
  Forum whether they should have corrected the misspelling - if one did I would
  have answered no.
It is critical for programmers to be sure they know the specifications of the
  problem they are being asked to solve, otherwise they will solve, test, debug
  document, etc. the problem incorrectly, and another cycle of development will
  be needed to fix the misconceptions.
The overview lecture included a graph that showed that the later in development
  a problem is found, the harder/more expensive it is to fix.
So if we can find problems at  the time we are reading the specification of the
  problem to solve, that can save us a lot of work/money later.
<p>
The bottom line is that you are responsible for reading the instructions
  carefully and reporting any confusion so that I can clear it up (best reported
  on the MessageBoard Forum for Programming Assignments).
Of course, you can freely talk to anyone about the problem specifications, just
  not the code you write for your solutions.
If you make any assumptions (like the node names in Programming Assignment #1
  always being one letter long -they aren't), they might come back later to
  haunt you (gradewise).
When working with a partner, you'll have two eyes reading the specification.
I am willing to deduct a point from many students to get across this
  perspective.
<p>
Also, some students did not carefully read the instructions in the Debugger
  Perspective document for the quiz part, which required them to change a line
  in the <b>craps</b> script before running it with the debugger to gather the
  required information.
With this change in your program, you can find the answers we need to check;
  without it, you cannot.
<p>
Finally, 28 students (28%) submitted the program 2 or more days early; 20
  students (20%) submitted the program 1 day early: so almost half of you
  submitted the program early and received extra credit for it.
Keep up the good work.
<p>
<b>IMPORTANT</b>
If you believe that we recorded one or more answers incorrectly, please
  <b>email your TA</b> (see the fact sheet; also cc a copy to me) and tell him
  what you think the differences are.
The TA for your lab is responsible for grading all the programs in your lab
  (the TAs will jointly grade the quizzes: one TA per problem across all labs).
Please read the comments in the <b>assignment grades</b> spreadsheet carefully
  <b>before</b> contacting your TA and ensure you understand the correct
  answers.
He will then re-examine the issue, possibly asking you for more information if
  there is still confusion, or talking to you during the lab meeting.
If there is a difference, he will email me a revised summary about
  your program, and cc a copy to you.
I will update the grades spreadsheet as appropriate (it might take a bit of
  time for all these events to cumulate in a changed grade).

  First Lab
</b></td>

  You will need to use the lab computers to take two In-Lab Programming Exams.
  As part of your first day in lab, students should check that they can log on
    to the ICS lab computers: those students who took previous ICS courses
    (which should be most of you) should have these accounts already.
  If you can log into these accounts, you can use them.
  <p>
  If you cannot log into these accounts, you should visit ICS-364 with your
     student ID during the lab, to have them activate an account for you.
  Activation may take a few days.
  In the meantime, you can work on your own computer or log onto the lab
    computers with the ID <b>ics-temp</b> and the password <b>Anteat3r</b>
   (yes, a capital <b>A</b> and the number <b>3</b>).
  When using Eclipse with this temp account, you must create a workspace on
    your desktop, not the <b>H</b> drive (otherwise all temp users would be
    sharing that workspace).

  All students with computers should download and install the Course Software:
    Java (to run Eclipse), Python, and Eclipse.
  All three products are available for free on the internet.
  Students can view instructions for downloading and installing this software
    by following then
    <a href="../common/online.html" target="main">Course Software</a>
    link.
  If you are using a Mac there are special instructions for you
    (Java is already installed; read the <b>Hints for Mac Users</b> first).

  <p>
  Although students can work on their programming assignments on the computers
    in the UCI labs, I expect students with computers to download and install
    this software by the end of the first week of the quarter.
  If you are having difficulty with this task, the TAs and Lab Tutors will help
    you during the first Lab meeting (or beyond, if necessary: bring your
    computer to the lab); if you have successfully downloaded and installed
    this software, please help other students do so too.
  Finally, you can also use the class MessageBoard Forums to ask questions about
    this software and help other students.
