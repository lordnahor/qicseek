<h2 class="style2">Overview</h2>
<div class="style2" style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>In this course students will build on
    the basic probability concepts learned
    in Math 67 and learn how these ideas can be applied to a broad range of problems in modern computer science. The methods and models used will
    be
    mathematical in nature, but will be illustrated using real-world
    applications.
    Among the application areas that we will discuss are
    modeling of
    text and Web data, network traffic modeling, probabilistic analysis of
    algorithms
    and graphs, reliability modeling, simulation algorithms, data mining,
    and
    speech recognition. The mathematical methods that we will use to
    analyze these
    applications will include basic principles of probability such as Bayes
    rule,
    conditional probability, random variables, expectation, Markov chains,
    and so
    forth. <br />
    <br />
    Note that <strong>Mathematics 67,<i> Introduction to Probability and Statistics
      for
  Computer Scientists</i>,</strong> is a <strong>prerequisite</strong> for this class.</p>

<h2 class="style2">Grading Policies</h2>
<div class="style2" style="margin-left: 40px;">The grading for this class will be
  based on: <br />
  30% for the N-1 best out of N homeworks (your lowest homework score
  will be dropped) <br />
  30% for the midterm exam <br />
  40% for the final exam </div>
<h2 class="style2">Homeworks</h2>
<div class="style2" style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>There will be approximately 8 homeworks during the quarter. Each homework due by
    the
    end of class on the due date. Late homeworks will not be graded so please just hand in whatever you have completed by the end the class that it is due.&nbsp;
    The lowest homework score for each student for the quarter will not be
    counted.
    Solutions will be provided after homeworks have been graded each week.<span
 style="">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p>You will be required to use<a
 href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Esmyth/courses/matlab.html"> MATLAB</a> for some of your homework problems.
    MATLAB is available on about 34 machines in the CS 364 lab - the
    machines are in 3 rows front of the lab assistant's desk and to the
    left of this desk as you face away from it. Note that Mikhail will be providing a tutorial on how to use MATLAB in the first discussion session on Friday the 12th of January. <br />
  </p>
</div>
<h2 class="style2">Email Communications </h2>
<div class="style2" style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>For questions relating to homeworks and grading please <a href="mailto:mkalinin@ics.uci.edu">email the TA</a> Mikhail directly with your questions. If Mikhail cannot answer your question, he will pass it along to Professor Smyth. For other more general questions about the class, please email Professor Smyth directly. </p>
  <p>In all emails about this class, please start the subject line with &quot;[cs 177].....&quot; so that we can easily keep track of class-related emails. </p>
  <p>We will try to respond to emails as quickly as is practical, but there may occasionally be a delay of a day or so, especially on the weekends. <br />
  </p>
</div>
<h2 class="style2">Academic Honesty</h2>
<div class="style2" style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>Academic honesty is taken seriously.
    For homework problems or programming
    assignments you are allowed to discuss the problems or assignments
    verbally
    with other class members, but under no circumstances can you look at or
    copy anyone
    else's written solutions or code relating to homework problems or
    programming
    assignments. All problem solutions submitted must be material you have
    personally written during this quarter. Failure to adhere to this
    policy can
    result in a student receiving a failing grade in the class. It is the
    responsibility of each student to be familiar with UCI's current
    academic
    honesty policies. Please take the time to read the current <a
 href="http://www.senate.uci.edu/9_IrvineManual/3ASMAppendices/Appendix08.html">UCI
      Senate Academic Honesty Policies</a> (in Spring Schedule of Classes, a
    few
    pages from the end). Also you may want to look at the<a
 href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/index.php?policy=cheating"> ICS Department's policies </a>on academic honesty .</p>
</div>
<h2 class="style2">Classroom Policies </h2>
<div class="style2" style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>You are asked to be respectful of your student colleagues and instructor in class, not being disruptive or otherwise distracting others in the classroom. This includes turning off cell-phones and not using your laptops during class.</p>
