							 <b>Abstract:</b><BR>
							
							 One of the fundamental debates about the future of the industrial way of life concerns the balance between resource depletion and technical innovation.
                            Technological optimists claim that depletion will always be compensated by innovations that lead to more efficient use of resources (more output per unit of
                            resource input), or by development of new resources. In this view, as a resource becomes scarce, prices signal that there are rewards to innovation. Innovators
                            and entrepreneurs accordingly respond with novel technical solutions. Optimists believe that this will always be the case, and that sustainable resource use is
                            therefore not an issue. Technological pessimists focus on absolute limits to resources in a finite world, on returns to investment, and on externalities such as
                            pollution. In the history of the industrialized way of life, the optimists have so far been correct: Innovation has managed to keep pace with depletion, so that
                            over the long run, the prices of many commodities have been constant. The factor overlooked in this debate is that innovation, like other forms of knowledge
                            production, grows in complexity and costliness and produces diminishing returns. This presentation explores the productivity of innovation since the early 1970s
                            to inquire whether our system of innovation can forever offset resource depletion, and even whether it can continue in its present form. <BR> <BR>
							
							 <b>About the speaker:</b><BR> Joseph A. Tainter is Professor of Sustainability in the Department of Environment and Society, Utah State University, having
                            previously served as Department Head. He received his Ph.D. in Anthropology from Northwestern University in 1975. Dr. Tainter worked on issues of sustainability
                            before the term became common, including his acclaimed book The Collapse of Complex Societies (Cambridge University Press, 1988). He is co-editor of The Way the
                            Wind Blows: Climate, History, and Human Action (Columbia University Press, 2000), a work exploring past human responses to climate change. With T. F. H. Allen
                            and T. W. Hoekstra he wrote Supply-Side Sustainability (Columbia University Press, 2003), the first comprehensive approach to sustainability to integrate
                            ecological and social science. His most recent book is Drilling Down: The Gulf Oil Debacle and Our Energy Dilemma, with Tadeusz Patzek (Copernicus Books, 2012).
                            Dr. Tainter has taught at the University of New Mexico and Arizona State University. Until 2005 he directed the Cultural Heritage Research Project in Rocky
                            Mountain Research Station. <BR> <BR> Dr. Tainter’s sustainability research has been used in more than 40 countries, and in many scientific and applied fields.
                            Among other institutions, his work has been consulted in the United Nations Environment Programme, UNESCO, the World Bank, the Rand Corporation, the
                            International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, the Beijer Institute of Ecological Economics, the Earth Policy Institute, Technology Transfer
                            Institute/Vanguard, and the Highlands Forum. Dr. Tainter has been invited to present his research at the Getty Research Center, the University of Paris
                            (Panthéon-Sorbonne), the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Uppsala University, the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, the University of Sheffield, Politecnico
                            di Torino, and many other venues. His research has been applied in numerous fields, including economic development, energy, environmental conservation, health
                            care, information technology, urban studies, and the challenges of security in response to terrorism. He appears in the film The 11th Hour, produced by Leonardo
                            DiCaprio, Leila Conners Petersen, Brian Gerber, and Chuck Castleberry, in the ABC News special Earth 2100, and in other documentaries. Dr. Tainter’s current
                            research focuses on complexity, sustainability, energy, and innovation. </div> </div> </div>
