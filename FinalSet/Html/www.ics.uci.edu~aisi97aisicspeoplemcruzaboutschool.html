<p>Our schools are located, really, on one campus. There are four different schools and daycare.  Each school has their own campus within the Campus.  Students from other schools are not
allowed  on school grounds that are not there own.  If caught off their own campus during school hours, without a pass or the proper authorities,
disciplinary action will be taken.
<p>We have one Pincipal and a Vice Pricipal, located in the Main Building in the center of the cmpuses.
