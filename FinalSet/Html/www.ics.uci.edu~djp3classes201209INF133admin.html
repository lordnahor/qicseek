				<h3>Attendance:</h3>
				<p>Students are responsible for material that is disseminated
				during class. If you miss class, please arrange beforehand with
				a friend to get notes/handouts for you. If you know you are
				going to miss something important, contact the instructor
				beforehand. It's much easier to accommodate planned
				absences.</p>
 
				<p>Students are responsible for all material taught in this
				course. If you join the class later in the quarter, you are
				expected to complete all missed work immediately.</p>
 
				<p>Attendance is part of your grade.</p>

				<h3>Announcements:</h3>
				<p>Announcements will be emailed to your UCI Net ID / Login
				through an EEE managed class mailing list. Please make sure it
				is set up properly and being forwarded to whichever account you
				normally read email from. Make sure it is not on your spam list
				or being filtered as junk mail.</p>
 
				<p>Many other announcements will be made in class as well.</p>
 
				<p>An email has been sent to the class mailing list. If you did
				not receive it, please investigate the problem so that you do
				not miss required information.</p>

				<h3>Email correspondence to instructors:</h3>
				<p>To make sure that the class staff see your email, please
				include the class code, "[INF 133]" , at the beginning of the
				subject line. If you do not get a response to the email in 24
				hours (except weekends), please resend it or talk to me after
				class. I recommend also cc'ing the EEE class mailing list on
				non-personal issues so that the entire class benefits from the
				discussion.</p>

				<h3>Late Penalty:</h3>
				<p>The late penalty is 1% per hour after the due date.</p>
 
				<p>Due dates are specified with a date and time in local
				time.</p>
 
				<p>For example, if an assignment's due date is 11:59pm on Monday
				night and it is turned in on 11:59pm Tuesday night it is 24
				hours late will be result in a 24% penalty.</p>

				<h3>Sick Policy</h3>
				<p>If you find that you are unable to make it to a scheduled
				event (class, exam, presentation, etc.) due to sickness, please
				get some documentation from a health care provider to assist us
				in maintaining fairness to the other students in the class. In
				the absence of such documentation, please contact the staff as
				soon as you realize that you are going to miss a scheduled
				event. Generally sicknesses will be treated on a case by case
				basis. We will accommodate you as best as we can depending on
				the circumstances.</p>

				<h3>Academic honesty:</h3>
				<p>Please familiarize yourself with the latest UCI academic
				honesty policy:
				http://www.editor.uci.edu/catalogue/appx/appx.2.htm.</p>
 
				<p>In a nutshell - you may never use anyone else's work without
				clearly acknowledging the source. This includes code you find on
				the web, text from books, and answers from friends. If an
				assignment requires you to do the work yourself, then
				acknowledging the source of an answer does not fulfill the
				requirements of the assignment.</p>
 
				<p>Plagiarism is any work that you use that you did not create
				and do not credit. The ACM publishes a more detailed definition
				<a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy">here</a>. 
				If you plagiarize another work without crediting the
				source, you will receive a failing grade for the entire course
				at the discretion of the instructor.</p>
 
				<p>This has happened in my courses before, it has happened in
				conferences that I have chaired and I have sat in conferences in
				which others have presented my work verbatim. In each of these
				cases I took the harshest possible recourse available to me at
				the time. Our global academic system relies on properly
				creditting sources for everything to function. I have kicked
				students out of UCI for cheating in my courses.</p>
 
				<p>It takes 2 seconds to cite your source. If you want to be
				intellectually lazy, do something else with your life.</p>

				<h3>Web Page, Readings, and Assignments:</h3>
				<p>The web page for the class is subject to update. Check it
				frequently and be sure to refresh / reload the web pages when
				you browse them.</p>
 
				<p>Please follow the assignments exactly. If you need
				clarification, ask before the assignment is due.</p>

				<h3>Students with Disabilities or Special Needs:</h3>

				<p>Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation
				based on the impact of a disability, religious observance (or
				anything else) should contact me privately to discuss his or her
				specific needs. If appropriate, contact the Disability Services
				Center at (949) 824-7494 as soon as possible to better ensure
				that such accommodations are implemented in a timely
				fashion.</p>
