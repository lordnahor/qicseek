This first real programming assignment is designed to ensure that you know
  the fundamentals of writing, testing, and debugging simple scripts using
  the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment (Eclipse IDE).
In the process you will
<ul>
  <li>Use various functions defined in the <b>prompt</b> module to prompt the
        user to input information (values).
  <li>Use assignment statements to store the input values into names
  <li>Use expression to calculate results based on these inputs and use
         assignment statements to store these calculated values into names.
  <li>Use the <b>print</b> function to output the calculated results.
</ul>
<p>
Before starting this assignment, download and unzip the
  <a href="../../programs/droptime.zip">droptime</a> project folder</a>; put
  this folder into your <b>workspace</b> and open it in Eclipse (as you did in
  Program 0).
It contains one script that you should examine and run; it inputs some
  information, performs some calculation on this information,and then outputs
  the results.
Use this script as a model for the scripts you must write in this assignment.
<p>
To start working on this assignment, download and unzip the
    <a href="program1.zip">program1</a> project folder</a>; put this folder
   into your <b>workspace</b> and open it in Eclipse.
It contains one script that you will modify (named <b>expresiontest</b>), and is
  a place to store all the other scripts that you will write from scratch
  (<b>escapevelocity</b>, <b>stringops</b>, <b>changemaker</b>, and
   <b>cartrip</b>).
You will create each modules in this project folder, and submit each module
  separately in Checkmate.
<p>
You should work on this assignment in pairs, with someone in your lab section.
Try to find someone who lives near you, with similar work habits/schedule:
  e.g., talk about whether you prefer to work mornings, nights, or weekends;
  what kind of commitment you will make to submit program early.
If you believe that it is impossible for you to work with someone, because of
  some special reason(s), you should send me email stating them and asking for
  special permission to work alone (which I do grant, but not frequently).
<p>
<b>Only one student should submit all parts of the the assignment</b>, but both
  student's names should appear in the comments at the top of
  <b>each submitted .py</b> file.
It should look something like
<pre><b>
# Romeo Montague, Lab 1
# Juliet Capulet, Lab 1
# We certify that we worked cooperatively on this programming
#   assignment, according to the rules for pair programming</b></pre>
Please turn in each program <b>as you finish it</b>, so that I can accurately
  assess the progress of the class as a whole during this assignment.
<p>
Print this document and carefully read it, marking any parts that contain
  important detailed information that you find (for review before you turn in
  the files).
Reread the section on <b>Time Management</b> from Programming
  Assignment 0 before starting this assignment.
<p>
All these scripts prompt the user for information on the console.
To access the these prompting functions, remember to first import them by
  writing <b>import prompt</b> in your program; call them by their qualified
  names (e.g., <b>prompt.for_float</b>).
Many of these scripts also use mathematical functions like the square-root
  function (<b>sqrt</b>) defined in the <b>math</b> module.
Import them by writing <b>import math</b> and call them by their names
  (e.g., <b>math.sqrt</b>); or you can use the alternative form of import
  <b>from math import sqrt</b> and then just call the name <b>sqrt</b>.
The <b>droptime</b> script shows examples of both <b>prompt</b> and
  <b>math</b> imports.
<p>
Finally, it is a mistake to try to do all these problems in one sitting
  (especially on the night that they all are due).
While all are simple, none are trivial and each part gets progressively harder.
Sit down during the first lab and try to finish the first part; over the 
  weekend, try to finish the second and third parts; if you succeed and have
  more time, finsh the last part (otherwise save it for next week) -maybe you
  will finish them all quickly.
Even though the programming problems get more complicated, the first few are
  likely to cause you the most trouble: understanding the basics of the
  assignment (shared by all the programs), setting up everything, etc.
It is important that you encounter all these difficulties early, by attempting
  to finish one problem over the first lab/weekend, well before the entire
  assignment is due; this will give you time to seek and obtain help, if you
  need it.

<td width ="20%"><b>Part 1:<br>Calculating Escape Velocity</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
  The velocity needed to escape the gravitation field of a planet is given by
  the mathematical formula
  <pre><b>
           +---------
          /  2 g mp
  ev =   /  --------
       \/      rp
</b></pre>
where <b>g</b> is the Gravitational constant (6.67x10<sup>-11</sup> in the
  metric system),
<b>mp</b> is the mass of the planet (in kilograms), <b>rp</b> is the radius of
  the planet (in meters) and <b>ev</b> is the escape velocity in
  (in meters/second). 
<p>
Here is a short table of planets and their (<b>approximate</b>) calculated
  escape velocities.
<p>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="1" rules="all">
<thead><tr><th align="left">Planet</th><th>Mass<br>(kilograms)</th><th>Radius<br>(meters)</th><th>Approximate Escape<br> Velocity (meters/sec)</th>

<p>
Write a script that prompts the user for a planet's mass and radius (as
  <b>float</b> values), and then computes and displays the escape velocity of
  the planet.
Verify that these answers are correct using the table above, to ensure that
  your script is working correctly: note that values it contains are just
  approximate.
Use the names in this formula in your program.
Here is the input/output form you script should duplicate: the user's inputs
  are shown in italics.
<b><pre>  Enter mass in kilograms: <i>5.983E24</i>
  Enter radius in meters: <i>6.357E6</i>
  Escape velocity = 11204.98580007702</pre></b>
Of course you should test your code for other values in the table above, to
  ensure the correct answers are calculated and printed.

<tbody>
<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%"><b>Part 2:<br>String Operations</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
Write a script that prompts the user for strings and computes various 
  operations on them.
Use section 5.2.7 as a guide having for indexing (computing individual
  characters) and slicing (computing sequences of characters or substrings)
  in strings; see section 5.2.3 for concatenation (putting characters and
  substrings together into strings).
<ol>
<li>Prompt the user for a word and print a <b>bool</b> value (<b>True</b> or
      <b>False</b> telling whether the first and last character are the same;
      try various length words, but always at least of length one.
<li>Prompt the user for a name in the form <b>Smith, Joe</b>; then print
      the index of the comma in the word and the name in the form
      <b>Joe Smith</b>.
<li>Prompt the user for a name in the form <b>Joe Smith</b>; then print
      the index of the space in the word and the name in the form
      <b>Smith, Joe</b>.
</ol>
Note that to compute the index of the first occurrence of a character we can
  use the <b>find</b> method on any string.
Here is an example that you can run/test as a script
<b><pre>word = 'balloon'
index = word.find('l')
print('l occurs first at index',index,'of balloon')</pre></b>
Remember that indexes in strings start at <b>0</b>  
<p>
Here is the input/output form you script should duplicate: the user's inputs
  are shown in italics.
<b><pre>  Enter a word: <i>radar</i>
  First and last letter the same? True
  Enter a name (e.g., Smith, Joe): <i>Stern, Hal</i>
  Comma in index 5 (remember first character is in index 0)
  Converted name: Hal Stern
  Enter a name (e.g., Joe Smith): <i>Michael Goodrich</i>
  Space in index 7
  Converted name: Goodrich, Michael
</pre></b>
Of course you should test your code for other values in the table above, to
  ensure the correct answers are calculated and printed.

<!-- Change Maker -->

<a name="ChangeMaker">
<hr align="left" width="33%">
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="0" rules="none" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%"><b>Part 3:<br>Change Maker</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
Write a script that prompts the user for some amount of change to make (an
  <b>int</b> from <b>1</b> to <b>99</b> cents; don't worry about bad input),
  and then computes and displays the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and
  pennies needed to make that amount of change.
Always compute the fewest coins to make that change.
For example, if the user entered <b>69</b> the script would display
<pre><b>  To make change for 69 cents:
    2 quarters
    1 dimes
    1 nickels
    4 pennies</b></pre>
Don't worry about displaying things like <b>1 dimes</b> (mismatching a
  singular and plural).
Before instructing the computer how to make change, think about how you would
  teach another person to make change.
<p>
Algorithm Hint: After the user inputs the amount of change to make,
  store/remember it in another name for use when we start printing values at
  the end.
Use names, keep track of the amount of change still left to be made (this will
  be reduced as the script executes), and the number of quarter, dimes,
  nickels, and pennies.
First compute and store in the name <b>quarters</b> the number of quarters in
  the change (you will find the <b>//</b> operator useful for divison, because
  it throws away the fractional part, leaving an integer).
Then, update the amount of change to make to be the amount remaining after
  subtracting the number of quarters returned times their worth.
Repeat this process (with similar statements) for dimes, then
  nickels, and finally for pennies.
Finally, print the calculated amounts.
<p>
For example, to make <b>69</b> cents in change, the program computes
   <b>69//25</b> which is <b>2</b>, meaning we should use two quarters;
   this leaves <b>69-2*25</b> which is <b>19</b> cents, meaning that we now
   must  make <b>19</b> cents in change by using dimes, nickels, and pennies.
To make <b>19</b> cents in change, the program computes  <b>19//10</b> which is
  <b>1</b>, meaning we should use one dime;  this leaves <b>19-1*10</b> which
  is <b>9</b> cents, meaning that we now must make <b>9</b> cents in change by
  using nickels, and pennies.
By following this pattern, the program computes and prints the result above.
Finally, note that some amounts for coins may be zero:
<pre><b>  To make change for 55 cents:
    2 quarters
    0 dimes
    1 nickels
    0 pennies</b></pre>
The formulas used above compute the right answer even if no coins of that
  denomination are to be used.
  <p>
An alternative way is to use the <b>%</b> operator (there are many different
   ways to solve this problem).
For example, to make change for <b>69</b> cents, after computing the need to
  return <b>2</b> quarters (same computation above), the amount of change left
  to make is <b>69%25</b> which is the remainder after <b>69</b> is divided by
  <b>25</b>: <b>25</b> goes into <b>69</b> twice, with a remainder of<b>19</b>.
Before programming the solution in Python, develop a procedure that allows
  <b>you</b> to calculate the right values when you follow it, and then
  automate that solution  by translating it into a Python script.
<p>
Here is the input/output form you script should duplicate: the user's inputs
  are shown in italics.
<b><pre>  Enter change to make(1..99): 150
    Entry Error: '150';  
    Please enter a value in the range [1,99]
  Enter change to make(1..99): 69
  To make change for 69 cents:
    2 quarters
    1 dimes
    1 nickels
    4 pennies</pre></b>
Notice how the prompt rejects the first input. Examine the documentation for
  the <b>for_int_between</b> function in the <b>prompt</b> module on the
  course web index by clicking <b>Course Library References</b> then
  <b>prompt</b>.
Of course you should test your code for other values, to ensure the correct
  answers are calculated and printed.

<!-- Formulas -->

<a name="Formulas">
<hr align="left" width="33%">
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="0" rules="none" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%"><b>Part 4:<br>Formulas -> Expressions</b></b></td>
<td width ="80%">
The following three lines contain a total of 13 formulas<p>
<image src="formulas.gif">
<p>
There are 7 on the first line, and 3 each on the second and third lines.
<p>
The script <b>expressiontest</b> contains code to test all these formulas: it
  prompts the user for the information needed by the formula, stores this
  information  into names, and prints the answers.
But, <b>you</b> need to translate each of the 13 formulas into a correct
  Python expression that calculates the answer (now, each now just says
  <b>answer = 0.</b>).
For maximum credit, your expressions should contain no redundant
   parentheses; parentheses are redundant if they can be removed, but
   leave the expression always still computing the correct answer, still
   performing the required operations in the correct order.
<p>
For example, the parentheses in <b>(a*b)/c</b> are redundant because
  even if we remove them, the expression <b>a*b/c</b> will still multiply
  <b>a</b> by <b>b</b> before dividing by <b>c</b> (by Python's rules of
  operator precedence and associativity).
The parentheses in <b>a/(2.*b)</b> are NOT redundant because if we remove
  them, the result will be the quantity <b>a/2.</b> times <b>b</b>.
Note, some students might write <b>a/2./b</b> but I find this expression
  more difficult to understand: you don't have to <b>minimize</b>
  parentheses; you just want to write no redundant ones.
There is a difference between these goals (reread the material above for
  clarification).
<p>
Finally, to access the mathematical constants &pi; and <i>e</i> in these
  formulas, import the name <b>pi</b> and <b>e</b> defined in the <b>math</b>
  module.
Use these names instead of writing your own literals that approximate these
  values.

<!-- Car Trip -->

<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%"><b>Part 5:<br>Car Trip Calculator</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
Write a script that prompts the user for information about a car trip and
  then computes and prints more information about the trip.
The program should prompt the user to enter
<ul>
<li>The car's tank size
<li>The car's mph (miles per gallon)
<li>The distance for the trip
<li>The cost of a gallon of gas
</ul>
Based on this information, the script should print (see the form below)
<ul>
<li>The car's range
<li>The amount of fuel needed for the trip
<li>The cost of gas for the trip
<li>The number of gas stops needed (assuming stopping only when completely
      empty: dangerous; and completely filling the tank at each stop)
<li>The amount of fuel left in the tank when the destination is reached.
</ul>
Here is the input/output form you script should duplicate: the user's inputs
  are shown in italics.
Round numbers are shown, to make explaining the calculation easier.
<b><pre>  Enter car's tank size in gallons: <it>10.</it>
  Enter car's mpg: <it>20.</it>
  Enter distance for trip in miles: <it>500.</it>
  Enter cost for a gallon of gas: <it>4.</it>

  This car has a range of 200.0 miles
  Assuming we start with a filled tank
    we will use a total of 25.0 gallons on this trip
    at a cost of 100.0 dollars
    requiring 2 refueling stops
    and when we arrive, the car has 5.0 gallons in its tank</pre></b>
Of course you should test your code for other values, to ensure the correct
  answers are calculated and printed.
Use appropriate names to store the inputs and calculated values
<p>
Hints:
Computing the first three values is straightforward, but the fourth (refueling
  stops) is a bit subtle, so let's explore it.
The trip distance divided by the car's range computes the number of tanks
  of gas needed for the trip; recall that the car starts with a full tank,
  so that ratio minus <b>1</b> is the number of refueling stops.
For the example above, we compute this ratio it is <b>500./200.</b> which is
  <b>2.5</b> tanks, so this trip requires 1.5 refueling stops (1.5 more tanks
  full of gas).
But, there is no such thing as half a refueling stop: we either stop to refuel
  and fill up the tank or don't;
This means there are really <b>2</b> refueling stops.
<p>
The <b>math</b> module defines a function named <b>ceil</b> (for ceiling)
  which takes as an argument a floating point number and returns that value
  (if it is integral: <b>math.ceil(2.0)</b> is just <b>2</b>) or the next bigger
  integer: <b>math.ceil(1.5)</b> is <b>2</b>.
We can use this function to convert the calculated <b>1.5</b> refueling stops
  to <b>2</b> refueling stops.
This is similar to the following simpler problem: how many buses do we need to
  transport <b>250</b> passengers if each bus we can use holds <b>100</b>
  passengers; the ratio is <b>2.5</b> buses, but there is no such thing as half
  a bus, so we need to raise the number to <b>3</b> buses.
We can compute this result as <b>math.ceil(250/100)</b>.
Use the Python interpreter to import and experiment with this function.
<p>
How much fuel do we have when we arrive?
Calculate how much fuel we put into the car for the trip (include the fact
  that we start with a full tank) and subtract the amount of fuel we use on
  the trip.
Use a calculator to check your approach to ensure it is correct, before you
  write your script.
