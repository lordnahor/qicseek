<p>
Flat code has a simple structure which makes fast decoding, but
the compression efficiency is poor.  A minimum-redundancy code, on the
other hand, is slower to decode then a flat code, but the compressed file
size is minimized.  This paper discusses the algorithm for constructing
the hybrid code which exhibits the simple structure of a flat
code and retains much of the compression effectiveness of a
minimum-redundancy code.
