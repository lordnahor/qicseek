 The name <i>Padhraic</i>
</font>

<font face="Verdana"><font size="2">
<p>

<i>Padhraic</i> is pronounced 
"Paw-rick". The letter "d" is silent since combinations of
letters like <i>adh</i> act like a vowel sound ("aw" as in "raw") in Gaelic.
This is a Gaelic version of the name <i>Patrick</i> which
in turn came from the Latin/Roman name <i>Patricius</i>. 
<p>

<i>Padhraic</i> is a fairly common name in Ireland (but obviously
less common in places like California). Somewhat confusingly
there are multiple different spellings of the name in
Ireland, such as <i>Padraic</i> and <i>Padraig</i>. To further
confuse things, the pronounciation is also different
in different parts of Ireland - in the very south
of the country (like Cork) the name Padhraic might be pronounced
something like "Pawd-rick", i.e., the "d" is pronounced and no longer
silent. But I'm from the West of Ireland, where "Paw-rick" is the
appropriate pronounciation.
<p>

There are other idiosyncracies to Irish names. For example
although my surname is Smyth (pronounced like the regular "Smith") the Gaelic
version of this is <i>Mac Gabhann</i> which is pronounced
"Ma-gow-an" (so "abh" acts like the vowel sound "ow", as in "owl").  Translated
literally, <i>Mac Gabhann</i> means ``son of the blacksmith" (hence
the <i>Smith/Smyth</i> translation into English).
<p>

And many Irish people have the English version of their
names on official documents like passports (including
me) but use their Irish names for everything else (e.g., John/Sean,
William/Liam, James/Seamus, and so on).  Its a long story,
but we tend to blame the English for all this confusion :)
