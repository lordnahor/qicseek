<LI><A NAME="QQ1"><H2>Answer to Question #1</H2></A>
The first part of this assignment requested the class to share three Web 
finds that we each felt were interesting.  <A HREF="#1st find">My first 
find </A> lead me to an <A HREF="http://www.tcp.com/pub/anime-manga/">Anime 
related FTP site </A> that had thousands of graphic files available for 
viewing.  I starting browsing through the graphic files and found a few 
that I felt were worthy enough to download.  When I decided to display one 
of these graphics in an HTML document I found out that it was not being 
properly displayed because I did not save the graphic file in the proper 
<A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Internet/WWW/HTMLPrimer.html#A1.6">
graphic file format required for Mosaic </A> to display it. 
<P><A HREF="#5Questions"><I>Return to list of questions.</I></a><P>

<LI><A NAME="QQ2"><H2>Answer to Question #2</H2></A>
My familiarity with the Web was very low at the start of the quarter and
so I took Professor Franklin's advice and starting to a little browsing.
One of my first stops was the <A HREF="gopher://gopher.uci.edu/"> UCI 
Gopher-based Campus Wide Information System.</A> This simple menu  has
links to a load of stuff, just browsing through this gopher system
can take hours.  It didn't take long to make realize that the Web's 
possibilities are quite limitless.  Regardless, my initiative brought me to
a gopher menu that displays <A HREF="gopher://ka.reg.uci.edu/11/ro">UCI 
Registar's Office, </A> from here you can select <I>Enrollments</I> to get 
another menu that has student enrollment information from up to three 
years past. Each enrollment year is the broken up into a <I>Summary</I> 
per academic year quarter and enrollment by <I>Majors by Unit</I>.
I could not provide a link directly to the menus so you'll have to do 
a little browsing yourself, just following the directions I 
provided through the <I>italics </I> and a go to <I>summary </I> to 
answer the questions I provided earlier.

<LI><A NAME="QQ3"><H2>Answer to Question #3</H2></A>
Ahhh...Sega! =)  Okay so I'm a video game junky at times and since
video game junkies like to know what new games  will be coming out
for the systems they spend time on I found the <A HREF="http://www.segaoa.com/"
>Sega Web.</A> I would also like to say that I found out about the Sega Web 
connection via the rec.games.video.sega Newsgroup on USENET.
<P><A HREF="#5Questions"><I>Return to list of questions.</I></a><P>

<LI><A NAME="QQ4"><H2>Answer to Question #4</H2></A>
One day I was taking a good hard look at the <A HREF="http://www.oac.uci.edu/
"> UC Irvine Office of Academic Computing </A> home page when the 
<A HREF="http://www.oac.uci.edu/instruct/">Seminars and Workshops</A> 
hypertext linked caught my attention.  The OAC Friday Morning Seminars are 
free computer science related seminars that are offered to any UCI affilated 
person, including students.  You can registar to participate though the <A HREF
="http://www.oac.uci.edu/instruct/Friday.html"> Seminar Registration via Web
form</A>, this form is also made available at the Seminar and Workshop 
page.  The currently announced seminar topics include seminars on the World 
Wide Web, X-Windows, and the UNIX operating system.
<P><A HREF="#5Questions"><I>Return to list of questions.</I></a><P>

<LI><A NAME="QQ5"><H2>Answer to Question #5</H2></A>
I arrived at this question because I needed one more to finish this
assignment. What I did was use the <A HREF="http://galaxy.einet.net/"> EINet 
Galaxy Homepage</A> to find a topic related to my planned major.  Once 
there I figured Microsoft is one of the richest companies in the world why not 
see what they are up to so I selected the hypertext link to <A 
HREF="http://www.research.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Advanced Technology 
Division </A>. Which led me to the Microsoft Research User Interfaces Group.
Sadly, this page is still under construction and there is not a whole lot 
there yet.
