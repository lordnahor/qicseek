<CENTER><P><B>What's goin on, I suppose that I'd kinda want to be happy
that you're at my web page.<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
This is some kind of country we live in where any idiot can have a web
page that can be exposed to millions of people. Though I highly doubt that
many people will see this one, if you are reading this, that I only have
about 999,999 to go.</B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="images/rainbow.gif" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=425></P></CENTER>

<P>I was born on November (allegedly Friday) the thirteenth, in Canton,
Ohio. I lived in Ohio with my parents, an older brother (Keith), and a
younger brother (Mike). In 1984, we move to sunny Southern California,
Mission Viejo to be exact. We only lived there for about a year, before
moving on to Newport Beach, also in California. To this day my family still
lives there, I moved out a week ago to take a computer science class, for
what reason I am writing this web page. I hope you aren't too bored.<BR>

<FONT COLOR="#00FF00"></FONT>
<P>To start off with, I'd like to say that even though I am taking a computer
science class, it is not one of my key interests to write computer code all
my life, or live at my desk.
<BR CLEAR=BOTH>I do, however, figure that no matter what I do elect to do in
life, computer science will weigh very heavily in it.
My interests do, however include hockey, football, fast cars, (like
my 1969 Camaro, but it only has a 307 V8 in it, but I'm saving money to
buy a 327) and music (Sublime is my favorite group, and by far the greatest in history). </P>

Brant, and even Whitney.</FONT></P></CENTER>
