<p>     Global warming is a phenomenon which has raised a significant amount of 
scientific and political concern over the past few decades.  It has been 
observed that average global surface and atmospheric temperatures have been 
steadily increasing since the beginning of this century.  These observations 
are conclusive; however, the evidence to support a cause for global warming is 
not quite so certain.  Green house gases, such as methane and carbon dioxide 
are <i>believed</i> to be the most significant cause of the global warming 
trend.  "External processes, such as solar irradance variations, variations of 
the Earth's orbital parameters (eccentricity, precession, and inclination), 
lithosphere motions, and volcanic activity, are factors in climatic 
variation"<A HREF="http://spso.gsfc.nasa.gov/eos_glossary/cli.html">(1)</A> as 
well.  Also, the depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer is thought to contribute 
significantly to global climate change.  Regardless of the causes of global 
warming, the <i>effects</i> upon the Earth's climate are potentially 
disasterous.  It is imperitive that we take action concerning 
these issues, but what can be done and how are the questions facing our world 
leaders today.  The United Nations has addressed concerns about global warming 
and climate change via the <A HREF="http://www.unep.ch/unfccc/fca6e.html">UN 
Framework Convention on Climate Change</A>.  The initiatives and actions 
agreed upon therein are promising, but many more positive results must be 
obtained before concerns about global warming and climate change should 
subside.

<p>     "The rise in global mean temperature of about 0.6 degrees Celsius 
over the last 140 years representsthe major piece of observational 
evidence in the global warming debate."<A 
HREF="http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/annrep93/globtemp.htm">(2)</A>  The 
"debate" is not about whether or not the average global temperatures have 
increased over the past century (clearly they have increased), but over 
such concerns as:
<ul> 
<li>Is the data collected on global warming sufficient to infer that we 
should be concerned about it's effects on climate?     
<li>What really are the causes of global warming and climate change?
<li>What can be done to slow or stop the process of global warming?
</ul>
<p>     Although "all major climate models agree that the clearest 
symptom of climate change would be a global warming... global temperature 
records exist only for the past century or so."<A 
HREF="http://www.unep.ch/iucc/fs005.html">(3)</A>  Since we can not base 
global warming and climate change theories on prior records, we are left 
with uncertain models pertaining to the effects of global warming and 
climate change.  The observed global temperature increase is small enough 
to have been caused by natural variability, but it is also possible that 
natural variability has hidden (temporarily) the climatic effects of 
green house gas emmissions.  Possible errors in measuring global warming 
trends may underestimate or exaggerate the occurance, which could 
give us inaccurate results.  Scepticism and criticism aside, scientific 
models of the Earth's atmosphere <i>do</i> suggest that there is probable 
cause for concern regarding global warming and climate change.
<p>     "The size of the observed warming is compatible with what 
climate models suggest should have resulted from past green house gas 
emissions."<A HREF="http://www.unep.ch/iucc/fs005.html">(4)</A>  Green 
house gas emission is the most popular explanation for the occurance of 
global warming because of the fact that these gases are capable of 
trapping solar radiation within the Earth's atmosphere which would 
otherwise be released into space.  The major greenhouse gases are:
<ul>
<li>carbon dioxide
<li>methane
<li>chlorofluorocarbons
</ul>
<p>     Carbon dioxide is the most prevailent green house gas put into the 
atmosphere by man made processes.  "The main source of carbon dioxide 
is fossil feul emissions."<A 
HREF="http://www.unep.ch/iucc/fs002.html">(5)</A>  Deforestation is 
also a contributer to carbon dioxide emission.  The biggest problem 
with deforestation may not be the levels of carbon dioxide emitted by 
burning forests (a "source").  In the future, deforestation could prove 
to be most relevant in that it significantly impairs the process by 
which carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere, photosynthesis (a 
"sink").  The complex carbon cycle is steadily changing as carbon 
dioxide levels rise above their natural levels within the atmosphere.  
This change is causing an imbalance between the sources and sinks for 
carbon dioxide, which is resulting in more carbon dioxide emission than 
removal, and thus, trapping solar radiation--raising the mean global 
temperature.  Also, carbon dioxide is chemically stable, which means 
that it will remain in the atmosphere for many decades after it is 
released, if it is not removed by a sink.  Methane is not as stable as 
carbon dioxide, as it is more easily destroyed by chemical reactions in 
the atmosphere.  This green house gas, although not as abundant as 
carbon dioxide, is much more efficient at trapping solar radiation so 
that it does not take as much to trap the same amount of heat.  
"Converting land to agriculture, particularly rice paddies, releases 
methane.  So do deforestation, coal mining, and the extraction and use 
of natural gas."<A HREF="http://www.unep.ch/iucc/fs002.html">(6)</A>  
Of the major green house gases, the most chemically stable are 
chlorofluorocarbons.  These gases will remain in the atmosphere for up 
to 100 years once released, and are even more efficient at trapping 
solar radiation than methane.  It is not clear, however, what the net 
green house gas effect of chlorofluorocarbon is, because it is also responsible for 
depleting the stratospheric ozone layer, which also inhibits solar 
radiation from escaping the atmosphere.<A 
HREF="http://www.unep.ch/iucc/fs031.html">(7)</A>  A decrease in 
ozone, however, allows more intense solar radiation to enter the 
Earth's atmosphere (mainly UV radiation) which could also cause an 
increase in global temperature.  The main concern over depleted 
ozone in the stratosphere is an increase in human vulnerability to 
skin cancer due to intence UV ratiation.  Photochemical smog 
produced by hydroelectric power generation generates ozone in the 
troposphere, which also traps heat near the Earth's surface.
<p>     Regardless of the controversy over the causes of global 
warming and climate change, enough concern has been generated over the issue to warrant 
major political conventions and scientific research efforts designed 
to deal with the phenomonon.  The concern is that global climate 
change could be causing, and exponentially exacerbate, 
occurances of climatic extreems and natural disasters which 
prove to be devestating to human life and society.  "Frequent 
reports of record-breaking events suggest that climate extremes 
are becoming more common."<A 
HREF="http://www.unep.ch/iucc/fs105.html">(8)</A>  These 
climatic extremes are especially effecting areas of the world 
with high density populations, leaving many people extreemly 
vulnerable to loss of life and/or property.  One example is that 
of increase in sea level at coastal areas.  As the temperature 
of the Earth increases, polar ice caps are subject to melting, 
receding coast lines throughout the world.  Since the most 
densly populated areas in the world are near coast lines, such a 
phenomenon could prove to be extreemly disasterous.  If there is 
anything that we can do to stop the process of global warming 
and climate change, it is in our best interest to do so.  
<p>     Ideas and proposals for solutions are being sought by 
the international community.  Just over a year ago, global 
warming made headlines world-wide when 154 Governments at the 
<A HREF="http://www.ciesin.org/datasets/unced/unced.html">Rio Earth 
Summit</A> signed a major environmental treaty, <A 
HREF="http://www.unep.ch/unfccc/fca6e.html">the UN Framework on Climate 
Change</A>.  There are so many interests to consider, and so 
many questions to be answered concerning the causes and effects 
of global warming and climate change, that the international 
community is faced with a grave challange in resolving the 
problems and potential catastrophe's involved.  "The 1992 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
is one of a series of recent agreements through which countries
around the world are banding together to meet this challenge."<A 
HREF="http://www.unep.ch/iucc/begincon.html">(9)</A>  Although such 
international forums have made significant progress on the issue of 
global warming and climate change,  there is a considerable amount of 
progress yet to come if there is any hope of finding solutions.
