		<description><![CDATA[I recall when you told a variant of this story in your Entrepreneurship class. I believe it serves as a good anecdotal reminder that as Humans our interaction with computers is still very new and unexplored. There are may be &#039;unsolvable&#039; problems, how we attempt to solve them might teach us something even more valuable than having a solution.]]></description>

A lot of times in college, I would read the chapter assigned and then intentionally look for another book by a different author on the same subject and get another view point.
