  <h3> Short Bio </h3>
  <p>

  Ian G. Harris is currently Vice Chair of Undergraduate Education in
  the Computer Science Department at the University of California
  Irvine. He received his BS degree in Computer Science from
  Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1990. He received his MS
  and PhD degrees in Computer Science from the University of
  California San Diego in 1992 and 1997 respectively. He was a member
  of the faculty in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department
  at the University of Massachusetts Amherst from 1997 until June
  2003.

  <h3> Research Areas </h3>
  <ul>
    <li> Functional Verification </li>
    <li> Electronic Design Automation from Natural Language </li>
    <li> Embedded Systems Security </li>
    <li> Hardware Support for Host-based Intrusion Detection </li>
  </ul>

  <p> Research projects in Professor Harris' group is related to
  testing of hardware and software systems. His field of interest includes
  validation of hardware systems to ensure that the behavior of the
  system matches the intentions of the designer. He also investigates
  the application of testing for computer security. His group's
  security work includes testing software applications for security
  vulnerabilities and designing special-purpose hardware to detect
  intrusions on-line.
  </p>

  <h3> Service </h3>
  
  <p>
 Professor Harris serves on the program committees of several leading
 conferences in test and verification including IEEE/ACM Design
 Automation Conference (DAC), IEEE International Test Conference
 (ITC), Haifa Verification Conference (HVC), IEEE Hardware Oriented
 Security and Trust (HOST), and the IEEE Conference on Technologies
 for Homeland Security.
