Release</a>: UNABOM is an organization I started in response to the F.B.I.'s 
poor record of successfully pursuing terrorists; I'm undercover 
here at UCI

betray me at your peril.

Congressional e-mail addresses</a>: This is a good way to monitor the 
activities of subversive Congresspersons: send them treasonous e-mail and 
see if they bite.  Could be particularly useful regarding the Speaker; 
you know what they say about those in sheep's clothing...

beach away from home?</H2></A>

	Naturists are always in search of new, exciting locales where they 
can bask in the buff; especially when travelling.  If you get tired of 
your favorite bare beach, or find yourself on the road without your 
bikini/trunks, you can always try one of our recommended sunspots; 
bring plenty of lotion!  We have listings in <A 
HREF="http://pegasus.cc.ucf.edu/~kr4ah/naturist/beaches/fl/fl.html">Florida</A>, <A HREF="http://www.bga.com/~bthorn/austin.html"> Texas,</A> (a great little site called Hippie Hollow), <A HREF="http://pegasus.cc.ucf.edu/~kr4ah/naturist/beaches/
blacks.html"> California,</A>  and <A 
HREF="http://pegasus.cc.ucf.edu/~kr4ah/naturist/beaches/Minn.html"> 
 Minnesota</A>, to name a few.  You can also enjoy life without tanlines 
in <A HREF="http://pegasus.cc.ucf.edu/~kr4ah/naturist/beaches/europe.html">Europe,</A> 
particularily in Italy and France.  International relations are often 
much advanced in these political arenas.

<LI><A NAME="QQ2"><H2>How can one get a passeport from a country that 
doesn't exist, and subsequently help create the promised land?
</H2></A> Any good political scientist is interested in the history and 
structure of myriad nations; some countries are constantly being overthrown 
and "recreated," others remain relatively stable, and still others fall 
somewhere in between.  Rarely does the opportunity arise to chronicle the 
dvelopement of an <b>entirely</b> new country, from its nascent ideological 
inception to its physical creation and developement.  The <i>Atlantis 
Project</i> has come up with plans to literally build a new island, to be 
called <a 
href="http://saturn.uaamath.alaska.edu/~kane/oceania_info.html">Oceania</a>.  You can obtain information on Oceania's Constitution and laws, as well as its conceptual founders and information on obtaining a passeport, by investigating <a href="http://satu

rn.uaamath.alaska.edu/~kane/oceania_start.html"> The Atlantis Project</a>.  An interesting prospect for the fringe element.   
Query: can we send people there involuntarily? (<i>ahem!)</i></A>

<LI><A NAME="QQ3"><H2> What exhibits are now on display, and what resources are currently available, at 
the <i>Centre Georges Pompidou</i>    in Paris?</H2></A> 
 
</H2></A> One current exhibit electronically recreates the voice of one of the most renouned 
<I>castratti</I>, Carlo Broschi, also known as <A 
HREF="http://www.ircam.fr/produits/services/farinelli.html"> Farinelli </A>.  He lived from 1705-1782, 
so obviously there is no extant recording of his voice.  To enhance a film dedicated to Farinelli by 
Gerard Corbiau, an organization called 
<I>Ircam</I> engineered a voice that is beyond the scope of current performers.  <i>En francais.</I>  One 
can also get information (in French or in English) on <A HREF= 
"http://www.ircam.fr/solidarites/sida/index-e.html">HIV and AIDS</A>, including counselling and support, 
free and anonymous testing centers, health organizations, and more from 
the Pompidou Center.  If it weren't for Steve Franklin's hotlist, I don't 
know that I would ever have come across this information.  Thank goodness 
for this class!

<LI><A NAME="QQ4"><H2>What is HTML, and where can I learn how to 
create an HTML
   document
?</H2></A> Ahhhh, the excitement of HTML.    HTML, or <i>hypertext markup 
language</i> provides structure to documents on the World Wide Web.  HTML 
uses a series of codes to transmit data, which are in turn translated by a 
client (such as 
Mosaic, Lynx, or Viola, for example) into recognizable screen formats.  
The most valuable aspect of HTML lies in its inherently interactive 
nature; one can "click" on highlighted text with the aid of a favorite 
rodent, connecting to to new links, 
maps, images, headings, etc. in order to continue a certain search path 
or to veer 
onto another search course.  HTML is still inferior to most desktop 
publishing programs,  with constraints on font selection and graphics 
placement, and many limitations on relatively simple functions.  For a 
good introduction to HTML, try the <a 
href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Internet/WWW/HTMLPrimer.html">Beginners Guide to HTML</a>, which covers the basic elements of creating an HTML document.  Next you may want to reference <a href="http://www.willamette.edu/html-composition/strict-html-single.html"> Composing Good HTML</a>, which can help with troubleshooting and improper use of various commands.

<LI><A NAME="QQ5"><H2>What do the South Georgia and Sandwich Islands 
have in common with Montserrat?</a>  <i> Formerly "Where can I get my daily 
Tarot and I Ching readings on line?"</H2></i>
<a href="http://www.ic.gov/94fact/country/220.html">  South Georgia, the 
South Sandwich Islands,</a> and <a 
href="http://www.ic.gov/94fact/country/164.html 
">Montserrat</a> are all islands administered by the U.K.    Montserrat is 
located in the Carribean, about 400 miles southeast of Puerto Rico, while 
the South Georgian and Sandwich islands nestle in near Argentina.  
Argentina claims that the nearby islands belong to them, but Brittain 
maintains control.  Montserrat 
has an indigenous population of about 12,701, while South Georgia is 
populated only by the folks in a small military garrison; the South 
Sandwich islands are uninhabited.  All are subject to volcanic activity, 
all count fishing as an important natural resource, and all are under 
Chief of State Queen Elizabeth II.
