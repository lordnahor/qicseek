				<div class="styled_title"><h1>Brief overview of the application and what it does</h1></div>
			</div>
				<p>
				We have created an application for people to set goals for themselves and make positive changes in their daily lives by joining a support group with friends that are sharing a similar list of goals in order to encourage, motivate, and accomplish selected goals.

				<br /><br />Our application allows you to create groups which are publicly shared and add goals to that group. Anyone can join that group and will have that group's goals added to their "remaining goals" list. When a user has accomplished a goal, it gets put into that user's completed goals list which then allows you to rate that goal. Other user's can view the rating of that goal and decide if they want to do it. We have implemented a list of preset goals with descriptions as well as the ability to add their own goals. We also have a "friends" functionality which allows the user to get updates on when other friends have completed a goal. User's also have their own statistics on the goals they have worked on.

			When all thought of how we self-improve ourselves, we all had different goals. So we decided to think out of the box, and figure out a way to implement all of our goals into an application. We asked ourselves, "What can mobile applications bring to users to help them complete their goals?" The answer is the ability to have a connection between users that we can use for support, motivation, and enthusiasm. We set goals for ourselves, but we often fall short of completing them. So what if friends share the same goals, so that people can hold each other on the completion of the task? The list of goals that we have preset in our application were brought from an online project titled "Project Reddit," where people are given weekly goals to accomplish. We thought it would be exciting to be able to see your friends share the same goals, and being notified of that. Having the ability to improve yourself with your own goals, as well as your friends goals, became the most exciting idea that came from our inspirations.

			<p>
			All of our art assets were created by the team. Our logo, splash screen, and group icons were all created in Photoshop CS5 from scratch. Our logo idea came from the idea of completing a goal. We thought of a fist in the air as would someone acting upon a completed goal. The colors were entirely arbitrary.

			<div class="page-header">
				<div class="styled_title"><h1>The process for making the application</h1></div>
			</div>
			<p>
			Our process initially began with figuring out what our application does. We tried to make sure that we thought out of the box, and that everyone agrees and are excited for the project. If there was one person not excited, then we move on to the next idea. It was important for us to be on the same level. Once we had our idea, we figured out the design of our interfaces. At the same time, we had the basic design of our database figured out. After designing the UI, we hard-coded the basic layout of our whole program. Then we had different people working on the different activities and getting them to merge together. We used Saros, an eclipse add-on, to get our project linked together. At the same time, we had someone working with linking the client-side with the database. Then we worked more on our program's functionality, and creating more options. Getting our application to do everything we wanted it to do, obviously, took the most time. It took about a span of four full work-days, and, by full, I mean 12 hour work-days. Then came testing and debugging on the last day. We were still touching up our functionalities as we were debugging. The last part was optimization. We attempted to make sure our program runs as fast as possible. In the end, we felt we were really successful in our process.

            <div class="page-header">
				<div class="styled_title"><h1>Major hurdles that had to be overcome</h1></div>
			</div>
			<p>
			Some of our major hurdles include time conflicts, limitations to the scope of our initial design/database implementation, and lack of experience with the back-end implementation. This was, for most of us, the first time working on a full-blown android application. We only had one team member with initial experience with databases. We spent the majority of our first few days figuring out our design so that it was not too far-reaching and learning all the aspects of android development. In the beginning, everything seemed like alien code, but by the end of the week, we all had a good understanding of the client-side and back-end processes and implementation. During the week days was when we had limited time restrictions when it came to meet up. We were still figuring out our design during those first few days, so it was hard to get people working on individual assignments. However, by Friday, we ended up spending more time with each other than sleeping. 
			</p>
			

            <div class="page-header">
				<div class="styled_title"><h1>Lessons Learned</h1></div>
			</div>
			<p>
			We learned to make sure we have the full design implementation down before we start. The design is absolutely necessary to have implemented first in order to have the scope of the project down and it gives us a general idea of how much time we will be needing together. We also learned that we have to make sure that the design of the databases have been completely implemented before anything so we can fully understand the scope of the project. We also learned that time organization and leadership is essential in projects like these. If you don't have a leader to organize the meet-up times, transportation, to-do lists, then the project quickly becomes unorganized. We also learned that getting adequate amount of rest and food before we start working is extremely important in the quality of our work. Buying food beforehand for the group in preparation for 10+ hours of work was a big help. Also, beer helps make things more exciting. Importantly, making sure every member is excited and motivated for the project keeps the group moral high and brings more quality to our work.
