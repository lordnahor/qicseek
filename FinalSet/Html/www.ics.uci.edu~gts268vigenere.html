We are presented with the following cipher:

We know it is a substitution cipher, but nothing more.
<H2>Monoalphabetic or Polyalphabetic?</H2>
<P>
Our first goal is to determine if it is monoalphabetic or
polyalphabetic.  We first do a frequency count:
<PRE>
a   14    g   12    l    13    q     5    v   10
b    8    h    8    m    16    r    11    w    9
c    7    i    5    n    13    s    18    x    7
d    5    j   11    o     4    t    15    y   16
e   22    k   14    p    13    u    14    z   11
f    6</br>
</PRE>
<P>
Notice all the letters appear several times, and the frequency does not
vary much.  This suggests a polyalphabetic substitution cipher.  The IC
is 0.041 for this cipher, so this suggests one also, and indicates the
period is rather long (5 characters or more.)
<P>
First we seek to establish the period.  We do a Kasiski examination,
and write down all repetitions and how far apart they occur:
<TABLE>
<tr><th>repetitions</th><th>first</th><th>next</th><th>interval</th><th>factors</th></tr>
<tr><td><tt>YVGYS</tt></td><td>3</td><td>283</td><td>280</td><td>2, 2, 2, 5, 7</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>STY</tt></td><td>7</td><td>281</td><td>274</td><td>2, 137</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>GHP</tt></td><td>28</td><td>226</td><td>198</td><td>2, 3, 3, 11</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>ZUDLJK</tt></td><td>52</td><td>148</td><td>96</td><td>2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>LEEBMMTG</tt></td><td>99</td><td>213</td><td>114</td><td>2, 3, 19</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>SEZM</tt></td><td>113</td><td>197</td><td>84</td><td>2, 2, 3, 7</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>ZMX</tt></td><td>115</td><td>163</td><td>48</td><td>2, 2, 2, 2, 3</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>GEE</tt></td><td>141</td><td>249</td><td>108</td><td>2, 2, 3, 3, 3</td></tr>
</TABLE>
<P>
The common factor to these is 2.  But 2 occurs whenever the period is
even, and is probably too short, so let us look at other factors.
Possibilities are 3 (7 out of 8 intervals), 6 (6 out of 8), 4 (5 out of
8), 12 (4 out of 8), 5 (1 out of 8), 7, 8, 9, 14, 16, and 28 (2 out of
8),  and all others in 1 out of 8.  3 is probably too short, and 4 and
12 make the repetition of LEEBMMTG accidental, which is very unlikely.
So the period is probably 6.
<P>
Working from this, we do a frequency count for each of the 6 alphabets.
The following table summarizes the counts:
<PRE>
			alphabets
letter	#1	#2	#3	#4	#5	#6
a	2	4		1	4	2
b		2	1	1	2	2
c		1			3	3
d					1	4
e	1		2	6	9	4
f				4	1	1
g	2		5	4	1
h	3		1	1	2
i		1	1		3
j	6	3		1		1
k	3	1	10
l	3	2	2		2	4
m	3	10	2			1
n		2	2	5	3	1
o			2	2
p		3	1	1		8
q		3		2
r			1	5	3	2
s	6		1	2	6	2
t	1	4	5	1		4
u	5	1	2	3	3
v	2	3	2	2
w	5	4
x		2	2			3
y	2	1	4	2	3	5
z	4	1	2	4
</PRE>
To check ourselves, we compute the IC for each of the 6 alphabets:
<PRE>
	#1	0.064	#3	0.071	#5	0.069
	#2	0.070	#4	0.054	#6	0.067
</PRE>
These indicate each of the 6 alphabets is monoalphabetic,
so we are probably on the right track.
<P>
Now notice the counts for each alphabet.  They look like those expected
of English, only shifted.  For example, in alphabet 1, notice the long
gap between N and R, which is surrounded by many letters in the ranges
J to M and S to W.  The normal alphabet profile has a similar feature,
the gap being from V to Z, and the surrounding letters being R to U and
A to E.  This indicates that the cipher is a shifted one, and that S
may be A.  A similar gap (from D to H) occurs in the frequency chart of
the second alphabet, so following the same reasoning, I is probably A.
Substituting the resulting characters, we obtain:

</PRE>
From this point on, we can simply guess.  The HE in the last group of
the first line suggests the E in alphabet #6 is really a T; trying
that out, and assuming again a shifted alphabet, we get:
<PRE>

</PRE>
In line 5, group 5, AND suggests AND; also, note that in group 8 of
line 1, the three letters NCE suggext that the preceding one is A or
E.  Given these, most likely the fifth alphabet is unshifted, so:
<PRE>

</PRE>
In line 1, group 6, we see HE again.  Guess that the preceding letter,
G, represents T; if so, and if the alphabet is shifted, the N should be
A.  We confirm this by looking in groups 2 and 3 on line 1.; group 3
begins with RE, which suggests ARE, and indeed group 2 ends in N.

<PRE>
If signals are to be displayed in the presence of an enemy,
they must be guarded by ciphers. The ciphers must be capable
of frequent changes. The rules by which these changes are made
must be simple. The ciphers are undiscoverable in proportion
as their changes are frequent and as the messages in each change
are brief. From Albert J. Meyers' Manual of Signals.
</PRE>
The keyword used to encipher this message was SIGNAL; the cipher used
was a Vigen&egrave;re cipher.
