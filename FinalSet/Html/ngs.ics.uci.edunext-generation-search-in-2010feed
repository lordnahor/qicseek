		<description><![CDATA[in addition to the search techniques you mentioned:
- collaborative/social searching: if you and i are searching for similar things, can computer interfaces help us both?

- search across heterogeneous data sources: data comes in many forms: text, structured data, vid, images; we need search interfaces/systems to search across different sources.

- structured and linked data: how will search across  different structured data work? is RDF the answer? or is it too complicated?]]></description>
