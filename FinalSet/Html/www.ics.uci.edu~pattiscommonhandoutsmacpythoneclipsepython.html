You may want to print these instructions before proceeding, so that you can

 refer to them while downloading and installing Python.

Or, just keep this document in your browser.

You should read each step completely before performing the action that it

 describes.

This document shows downloading and installing Python on OS X 10.6 and later.

<p>

<h2>Python: Version 3.3.2</h2>

<p>


The Python download requires about 18 MB of disk space; keep it on your machine,

 in case you need to re-install Python.

When installed, Python requires about an additional 50 MB of disk space.

<ol>

<p>

   <p>

   Read through the <b>Download Python</b> section

     to find the implementation that you want to install: in this

     handout we will download <b>Python 3.3.2 OS X 64-bit/32-bit x86-64 Installer</b>.

   <p>


<li>Click the bulleted item <b>Python 3.3.2 OS X 64-bit/32-bit x86-64 Installer</b>

    (for Mac OS X 10.6 and later).

   <p>

   The file named <b>python-3.3.2-macosx10.6.dmg</b> should start downloading in your

     standard download folder.

   This file is about 19 MB so it might take a while to download fully if you

     are on a slow internet connection (it took me about 30 seconds over a

     cable modem).

   <p>

   The file should appear as

   <p>

   <img src="images/python/mac/dmgfile.png">


<p>

<li>Move this file to a more permanent location, so that you can install Python

     (and reinstall it later, if necessary).

<p>

<li>Start the <b>Installing</b> instructions directly below.

</ol>

<p>

   <img src="images/python/mac/pythonsetup5.png">

   <p>

   By default Python will be installed in your <b>Hard Disk Drive</b> ("Notchee" in this case"). Unless you have a good reason to use another directory, use this one.



<p>

<p>

<li>Click <b>Install</b>.

   The previous pop-window will reappear, displaying the message<br>

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Install Python 3.3.2</b><p>

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Please wait while the Installer installs

          Python 3.2.3. This may take<br>

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;several minutes.</b>

   <p>

   During installation, it will show the various operations it is

     performing and a progress bar for each one.

   <p>

   Eventually a new <b>Install Python</b> window will appear.

   <p>

   <img src="images/python/mac/pythonsetup6.png">


<p>

<li>Click the <b>Close</b> button.

</ol>

<p>

Python should now be installed.

To try to verify installation, navigate to the directory

  <b>/Applications/Python3.3</b> (or to whatever directory on which you installed Python)

  double-click the icon/file <b>IDLE</b>.

The following pop-up window will appear.

   <p>

   <img src="images/python/mac/pythonrunning.png">

   <p>

A pop-up window with the title <b>Python 3.3.2 Shell</b> appears, and inside

 the window on the first line is the text <b>Python 3.3.2 ...</b>.

Inside the window, at the bottom left, is the prompt <b>&gt;&gt;&gt;</b>: type

 <b>exit()</b> to this prompt and press <b>enter</b> to terminate Python.

<p>

You should keep the file <b>python-3.3.2-macosx10.6.dmg</b> somewhere on your computer in

  case you need to reinstall Python (not likely necessary).

<p>

You may now follow the instructions to download and install Java, and then the

 instruction to download and install the Eclipse IDE (for Python).
