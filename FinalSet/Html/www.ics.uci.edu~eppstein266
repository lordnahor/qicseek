<h1>ICS 266, Spring 2006:<br>
Computational Geometry</h1>


<hr>
<p></p>

<h2>General Course Information</h2>

<p>Coursework will consist of weekly homeworks and a comprehensive final 
exam. The course text will be <i>Computational 
Geometry Algorithms and Applications</i>, 2nd ed., by de Berg, van Kreveld, 
Overmars, and Schwarzkopf (Springer-Verlag, 2000). The course meets
Tuesdays and Thursdays, 11:00 - 12:20 in ICF 101.</p>

<p>Homeworks will be assigned on Thursdays, due in class the following Tuesday.
Due to lack of teaching assistance for graduate classes, we will be
employing the following homework grading policy: you must be present in
class Tuesday for your homework to be scored. At the start of the
lecture, I will go over the answers to the homeworks together with a
scoring rubric, and each student will grade his or her own homework
according to the rubric. I will then collect and record the graded
homeworks.</p>
