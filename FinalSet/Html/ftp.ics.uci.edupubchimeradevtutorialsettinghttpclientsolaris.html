<H2>Setting HTTPClient 0.3 in the CLASSPATH on Solaris</H2>

<p>&nbsp;
This section provides an example of how to set up your downloaded HTTPClient 0.3
to be included it in the CLASSPATH environment variable.  CLASSPATH is the
environment used by the Java interpretor (JVM) to look for Java byte-code.
</p>

<p> Note: the tcsh shell was used for this example.</p>

<H3> Appending the CLASSPATH to include the Rivendell byte-code files</H3>

<p> After you have unzipped the downloaded HTTPClient.zip
file, you
will need to include its class files 
in your CLASSPATH environment variable. 
</p>

<p> You may use any technique you like to set the CLASSPATH.  In this 
example, we are using the setenv command to append the CLASSPATH.
The command will look like this:
<br>
<tt>setenv CLASSPATH $CLASSPATH':<i>path_to_http_classes</i>'</tt>
<br>
Note: the ' quotes the string :path_to_http_classes so that tcsh won't
interpret the colon :.
