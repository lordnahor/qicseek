		<description><![CDATA[Many Americans, and others, may be repulsed, but why do we have sweatshops in the first instance? We all love a bargain, especially in these times when we want to be careful with how we spend our income. When companies think they can outsource to Asia for example where labor costs are much less, AND can sell their cheaply produced goods back in the West for a huge profit, there needs to be a market in the West for these. I agree with Mr Kristoff and would like to add that tackling the root cause for positive change we may need a paradigm shift from competition to co-operation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ramesh,

I really appreciate your thoughtful blog and I agree with you whole heartedly on the sweat shop factories.  Having lived in a privileged country, I cannot right say whats best for those who have not.  You have a very nice way with words. I&#039;ll stop by again soon.
