<h1> Game of Life</h1>
This is an implementation of John Conway's Game of Life created for Bill Tomlinson's
<a href = "http://www.ics.uci.edu/~wmt/courses/BiomoW04/BiomoW04Syllabus.html">Biomorphic Computing course</a> 
at the <a href = "http://www.uci.edu">University of California, Irvine</a> in the Winter Quarter of 2004 
in response to 
<a href = "http://www.ics.uci.edu/~wmt/courses/BiomoW04/BiomoW04Assignment1.html">Assignment 1</a>.
The framework of the code was written by <a href = "http://www.ics.uci.edu/~wmt">Bill Tomlinson</a>, and the
core functionality was written by So Yamaoka, an 
<a href = "http://www.ace.uci.edu">ACE</a> student in the class.<P>

Of particular interest is the following pattern, discovered by Alex Baker, 
an <a href = "http://www.ics.uci.edu">ICS</a> student in the class.  
Draw two vertical lines-of-six, overlapping a horizontal line-of-8 so 
that the second-from-the-bottom pixels of the vertical lines overlapped 
the second-from-the-left and second-from-the-right of the horizontal line 
(see below).  It offers quite interesting results in both the von Neumann 2 
and von Neumann 3 neighboorhood functions (pull down the list where it 
says "Moore"), in particular in von Neumann 2 at step 42 ("the teddy cherub") and 49 
("the man in the egg"), and in von Neumann 3 at steps 
8 ("the raccoon") and 16 ("sad bear with suitcases").<P>
