<P>

As the business environment becomes increasingly global and information-centric, the need has increased for graduates who understand and can use technology that gathers and provides information, who are able to distill and recognize patterns in that information, and who can apply those analyses to achieve business objectives.
<P>
Administered by the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences, Business Information Management (BIM) is a collaborative, interdisciplinary degree program between the Bren School and 
<A HREF="http://merage.uci.edu/">The Paul Merage School of Business</A>.
<P>
BIM majors receive a firm grounding in mathematics, statistics, software engineering, databases, economics and business accounting, management science and information technology. Students interested in learning how to apply computational methods and tools for achieving strategic business analysis and decision-making goals are encouraged to explore this degree program.

UC Irvine offers several ways to add depth scope, and experiential learning to your academic program of study. An academic counselor will help you determine the most efficient way to add another major, a minor or concentration to your academic plan, and will refer you to other campus programs and resources that support your interests and future goals. All Bren School majors in good standing may propose an academic plan that demonstrates the ability to complete the concentration and other requirements for graduation in a reasonable timeframe.

<UL class="content-list-large">
   
   <LI><STRONG>CONCENTRATION: Engineering and Computer Science in the Global Context. </STRONG>

       The globalization of the marketplace for information technology services and products makes it likely that Bren School graduates will work in multicultural settings or be employed by companies with extensive international operations or customer bases. The goal of the concentration is to help students develop and integrate knowledge of the history, language and culture of a country or geographic region outside the United States, through coursework both at UCI and an international host campus, followed by a technology related internship in the host country. 
       <P CLASS="sub-indent">
          <P><STRONG>Application:</STRONG><BR>
             Each student’s proposed program of study, specifying coursework and a guided internship experience in a region outside the U.S. must be approved in advance by the Bren School’s Associate Dean for Student Affairs. It is expected that each student’s proposal will reflect a high degree of planning that includes the guidance of academic counselors and those at the UCI Center for International Education regarding course selection, as well as considerations related to internship opportunities, housing and financial aid. The academic counselors and the Associate Dean will be available to assist qualified students with the development of a satisfactory academic plan, as needed.
      <P><STRONG>Requirements:</STRONG> <BR>
             <UL CLASS="sub-indent">
             <LI>A minimum of eight courses at UCI or at the international campus with an emphasis on the culture, language (if applicable and necessary), history, literature of the country that corresponds to the international portion of the program, international law, international labor policy, global issues, global institutions, global conflict and negotiation, and global economics;  </LI>
             <LI>A one- or two-semester sequence of technical courses related to the major and, possibly, cultural, history and literature courses taken at an international university; </LI>

             <LI>A two-month or longer technical internship experience in the same country as the international educational experience. </LI>
              </UL>
       </P>
   </LI>
    
   <LI><STRONG>Bren School Honors Program.</STRONG> 
      Allows juniors and seniors enrolled in Bren School major (Biomedical Computing, Business Information Management, 
      Computer Game Science, Computer Science, Computer Science and Engineering, Informatics, Information and Computer 
      Science, or Software Engineering) to pursue advanced work in one of many research areas. Students who join the 
      program participate in an honors seminar, conduct independent research under the guidance of a faculty member, 
      and write a research paper.
