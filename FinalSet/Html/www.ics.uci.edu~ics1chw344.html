<LI><A NAME="QQ1"><B>Q-What is Vitual Memory?  </B></A><br>
Virtual memeory allows the computer to use the hard disk for RAM.  This 
can prove to be very valuble when you are working with a limited amount 
of RAM.  A good virtual memeory program will opitimze the amount of RAM 
you have.  In other words it allocates most of the RAM for the programs 
are currently being used.  For the programs that are in the background 
thier RAm demand is satisfied by the Hard disk.  It is a lot slower but 
when you don't have the money to buy more simms it makes a lot of 
sense.

<LI><A NAME="QQ2"><B>Where are some places on the web where I can find out about Free Market Economics?   </B></A><br>
Actually, there are many.  Since the web is so powerful it has a tremendous amount of information contained within it.  In fact many 
of the political parties have their own home pages.  These home pages will communicate lots of information about all aspects of 
the respective party.  However, for Free Market Economics, the best place on the web would most certainly be the <A HREF=http://www.lp.org/lp/lp.html>libertaian page </A>
The libertarians are the cahmpions of the free market.  Infact in their political platform 
there are many references to this belief.  Check it <A HREF=http://www.lp.org/lp/platform/intro.html>out.</A> <p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to

<LI><A NAME="QQ3"><B>Can the WWW be used to reduce search costs when you are going to purchase something such as a car? </B></A><br>
My answer is... QQ3yes, there is.  We all know that the more information availble the better decisions we cam make.  And when we are 
shopping for something we sometimes have a high cost of search.  For example, if you are shopping for a car it is somewhat costly in 
time to visit every dealership.  However, the Web can be used to reveal a lot of information about car shopping with a smaller 
search cost.  For example, if yo are interested in learning about a particular make of car you can go to the <A HREF=http://www.w3.org/hypertext/DataSources/bySubject/Automotive/automotive.html>automobile home page.</A>  From this home page you can browse
 much 
information that covers almost evry make of car imaginable.  Now still consider you are searching to buy a car, You might also want 
to know specific performance info about a particular model the web can do this.  For instance if you wanted to know the performance 
potential of a camaro you could <A HREF=http://ram.chem.tulane.edu:8080/f-body/c&t/hrt.html>click here.</A>   <p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to 
list of questions.</it></a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ4"><B>What is a URL?</B></A><br>
My answer is... QQ4  A URL is a Uniform Resource Locater.  It is basically an address for a document on the www.  The first part of 
the address defines the protocal.  Inother words what type of language is going to be used between the client and server.  The 
next part is the site of the computer.  The third part refers to what port the client should connect to the server at.  To find 
out more check out some of these articles in the ics1c reference <A HREF=http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/refs.html>section.</A>  However for 
specific instruction on creating URL's see "URL's and Naming resources on the <A HREF=http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/urls.html.>web.</A>  <p><A

<LI><A NAME="QQ5"><B>Is there places on the web that I can learn more about current and past Rock and Rollers?</B></A><br>My answer 
is... QQ5 You have come to the right place to find out about Rock and Roll.  I guess there are alot of music fans that like 
computers as well.  To begin with, ther is information on virtually every band.  Check out this <A HREF=http://american.recordings.com/wwwofmusic/pop_list.html>band list</A> for instance.  
 From here you can learn about anyone you like.  However, if yo have the guts 
you can dig far enough to find out some interesting info about some famous bands.  For instance you can learn about all of the 
<A HREF=http://www.cs.rochester.edu/users/grads/jonas/beatles/backwards.html>beatles back masked messages </A> on the web   This is pretty 
interesting stuff.  As you canlearn about the beatles you can also learn about brand new cutting edge bands as well just browse the 
ultimate band list. <p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>
