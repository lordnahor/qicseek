<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><strong>Week 2 (due January 16):</strong></P>
<uL>

 <LI>Read Chapters 00 and 01 of the <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Linguistics">Linguistics Wikibook</a> [Stabler 1 and 11].  Feel free to follow up on Piazza with questions and comments.  But note that we'll spend time in class next week talking about phonetics, the subject of Chapter 01.    Also, the authors may address or emphasize things that just aren't important for what we're doing.  That means you shouldn't worry if small passages aren't crystal clear; don't spend a lot of time on those passages and we can discuss on Piazza or in class whether it's important to understand them further.</LI>
 <LI>There's no written assignment for this week.</LI> </uL>

<P><strong>Week 3 (due January 23):</strong></P>
<uL>
 <LI>Read Chapters 02 and 03 of the <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Linguistics">Linguistics Wikibook</a> [Stabler 12/13 and 2]. These are the topics we'll get to after phonetics.</LI>
 <LI>Choose a language you know, other than English. It doesn't matter how well you know it. Let's call it Language X. Write down three different consonant sounds (of the sort we talked about in class) that Language X has but English doesn't have. For each sound, give an example of a word or phrase in Language X that contains the sound and try to describe the sound in the articulatory phonetics terms we covered in class. (Typically that woud include a point of articulation, like &quot;bilabial&quot; or &quot;palatal&quot;, and a manner of articulation, like &quot;voiced stop&quot; or &quot;voiceless fricative.&quot; So the sound [z] is an alveolar voiced fricative.)</LI>
</ul>
<p><strong>Week 4 (due January 30):</strong></P>
<ul>
  <li>Read Chapter 04 of the <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Linguistics">Linguistics Wikibook</a>. There's another free linguistics text that you might prefer; it's <a href="http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/stabler/20.pdf">Lecture Notes: Linguistics</a> by Edward Stabler. I've indicated the corresponding chapters above; the chapters that correspond for this week are 3 through 7. All these readings should provide some background for what we do in class; you should look over the indicated chapters in at least one of the texts, but you should not feel obligated to read them in great detail.</li>
  <li>There's no written assignment for this week.</li>
</ul>
<P><strong>Week 5 (due February 6):</strong></P>
<uL>
 <LI>There's nothing additional to read for this week; use the opportunity to catch up (or study for your midterms).</LI>
 <li>You may do the written part of this assignment by yourself; you may also do it with one or two partners because you may learn something more by discussing the problems.  If you work with partners, turn in one paper copy with everyone's name at the top.  If there are four of you, split into two groups of two.
 <p>Here is a phrase-structure grammar like the one we looked at in class.  It describes an extremely limited subset of English. Each line is a "rewrite rule"—it says that the item to the left of the arrow can be rewritten as the item(s) to the right of the arrow. Thus, the first line says that S (for &quot;sentence&quot;) can be rewritten as NP (for &quot;noun phrase&quot;) followed by VP (for &quot;verb phrase&quot;).  The vertical bar means &quot;or&quot; (so the last line says that V can become &quot;<code>ate</code>&quot; or &quot;<code>chased</code>&quot; or &quot;<code>saw</code>&quot;.  (We use the <code>typewriter font</code> to indicate &quot;terminal symbols&quot; that could occur in the language as part of the final sentence (i.e., that can't be rewritten because they don't occur on the left side of any grammar rule).)<br />
 S —&gt; NP VP<br />
 NP —&gt; Art N<br />
 VP —&gt; V NP<br />
 Art —&gt; <code>a</code> | <code>the</code> | <code>this</code> | <code>that</code><br />
 N —&gt; <code>cat</code> | <code>dog</code> | <code>mouse</code><br />
 V —&gt; <code>ate</code> | <code>chased</code> | <code>saw</code>
 <p>(a) Write three varied sentences that this grammar produces.
 </p>
 <p>(b) Write two Engish sentences that this grammar does not produce, but that it <em>could</em> produce if the definitions of Art, N, and V were expanded.</p>
 <p>(c) Write two English sentences that this grammar could not produce even if all the words in the sentence were included in the definitions of Art, N, and V.</p>
 <p>(d) Does this grammar really describe a subset of English? That is, can it generate any sentences that are <em>not</em> part of English, sentences that you think most English speakers would not accept as English sentences? If so, give an example of such a sentence.</p>
 <p>The grammar above is finite. We could list all the possible sentences in the language it describes. With one small addition, the grammar below is infinite (as all natural languages are infinite):</p>
  S —&gt; NP VP<br />
 NP —&gt; Art N | NP Conj NP<br />
 VP —&gt; V NP<br />
 Art —&gt; <code>a</code> | <code>the</code> | <code>this</code> | <code>that</code><br />
 Conj —&gt; <code>and</code> | <code>or</code><br />
 N —&gt; <code>cat</code> | <code>dog</code> | <code>mouse</code><br />
 V —&gt; <code>ate</code> | <code>chased</code> | <code>saw</code>
 <p>(e) Write two sentences that this grammar produces but the first grammar doesn't (which means you'll use the second alternative for NP at least once).
