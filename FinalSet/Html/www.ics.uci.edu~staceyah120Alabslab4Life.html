      Demographers work with the distribution of age at death in the
      form of a "life table", which displays the information in tabular
      form. Starting with 100,000 live births at year zero, the life
      table shows the number who are expected to survive to the end of
      the next year. If you divide that number by 100,000, you have the
      probability of surviving to the given age. This is also known as
      the "<font color="#009900"><b>survivor function</b></font>", which
      is just the <b>complement of the cumulative distribution function</b>
      for age at death. In other words, if F(x) is the cumulative
      distribution function (cdf) for age at death (Pr(age of death
      &lt;= x)), then the survivor function is S(x) = 1-F(x). Similarly,
      F(x) = 1- S(x). To see the 1997 life tables for US males and
      females, issue the R command: </p>
    <pre>Life97 &lt;- read.table("http://people.reed.edu/~jones/141/Life97.dat",
                      header=TRUE)
</pre>
    The <i>read.table()</i> function can be used to read a table of
    data (for example created by a spreadsheet, and saved as plain text,
    tab, space, or comma delimited) from your local machine or from a
    URL as in this example. If comma delimited, use <i>read.table("file",header=TRUE,sep=",")</i>.
    <hr> Now enter the name of the data.frame to see the life table:
    <pre>           Life97
</pre>
    You can see that in the older age groups, the ratio of females to
    males becomes increasingly large. It is worth noting that life
    tables like these are based on historical data and model-based
    projections. Your mileage may vary!
    <center>
      <h4>Computing Life Expectancy from the Life Table</h4>
    </center>
    <p> Life97$Male is the data for males, and Life97$Female is the data
      for females. Alternative equivalent expressions are
      Life97[,"Male"] and Life97[,"Female"], or Life97[,2] and
      Life97[,3]. <br>
    </p>
    <p> These tables represent the number surviving to a given age. If
      we divide by 100000, we will have the proportion surviving to a
      given age. We will work with the distribution for age at death.
      "Death at or before n" is the complement of the event "survival
      through age n". </p>
    <p> To compute the cumulative distribution function for age at death
      for females use the following R command: </p>
    <pre>           Fem  = 1 - Life97$Female/100000
           Male = 1 - Life97$Male/100000
</pre>
    Here are commands to plot of the cumulative distribution functions:
    F(n) = Pr(age at death less than or equal to n). Note the use of
    'par(mfrow=c(2,1))' to create a window with two rows and one column
    of plots. Try 'par(mfrow=c(1,2))'.
    <pre> 
           par(mfrow=c(2,1))
           barplot(Fem,names.arg=Life97$age,space=0)
           title("Females")
           barplot(Male,names.arg=Life97$age,space=0)
           title("Males")
</pre>
    The probability of death at age n is the difference between F(n) and
    F(n-1), that is the probability of death at or before age n, minus
    the probability of death at or before age n-1. In R we can use the
    following commands to compute the probabilities of death in a given
    year:
    <pre>           Pf &lt;- diff(Fem)
           Pm &lt;- diff(Male)
</pre>
    The diff() function computes the differences between successive
    values in the dataset. The result is the probability of death in
    year N, for N running from 1 to 119. Here are commands to plot of
    the cumulative distribution along with the probability density
    function (histogram) just described for females:
    <pre>           barplot(Fem,names.arg=Life97$age,space=0)
           barplot(Pf,names.arg=Life97$age[-1],space=0,col="green")
</pre>
    Make sure you understand the relation between these pairs of graphs.
    <p> Compare the shapes of the density functions (histograms) for
      male and females. What differences can you see? Can you explain
      the differences? </p>
    <p> We are now ready to compute the expected age at death, known
      more positively as the "life expectancy". The age categories are 1
      to 119 years, in 1 year intervals. </p>
    <pre>           age = 1:119
           sum( age*Pf )
</pre>
    In fact, people don't die on their birthday; deaths are distributed
    throughout the year. If the deaths are roughly evenly distributed
    within years, then the average age at death in year n would be
    n-1/2. How much difference does that make?
    <pre>           age &lt;- (1:119)-1/2
           sum( age*Pf )
</pre>
    <p> </p>
    <center>
      <h4> Conditional Life Expectancy</h4>
    </center>
    What is the conditional probability of death at age k, given you
    have survived to age n? Can you see how to compute the conditional
    probabilites for k=n+1,n+2, n+3,...? Hint: you need to use the
    definition of conditional probability! You are conditioning on an
    event of the form "age &gt; n".
    <pre> 
    Pr(age &gt; n) = Pr(age = n+1)+ Pr(age=n+2) + ...  
</pre>
    For example, the probability of survival past age 50 is
    <blockquote>
      <pre>sum(Pf[51:119])
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    It is a bother to have to figure out which categories to sum,
    especially when the age categories don't exactly match the row
    numbers of the table. A neat solution is to let <b>R</b> do the
    selection for you:
    <blockquote>
      <pre>sum(Pf[age &gt; 50])
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    To see what <b>R</b> is doing, just print the data,
    <blockquote>
      <pre>data.frame(age,Pf)
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    and then compare to the selected subset:
    <blockquote>
      <pre>data.frame(age,Pf)[age&gt;50,]
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p> The conditional probability of death at age n+1, given death at
      age greater than n, is </p>
    <pre> 
    Pr(age = n+1 | age &gt; n) = Pr(age = n+1 and age &gt; n)/Pr(age &gt; n)

                            = Pr(age = n+1)/Pr(age &gt; n)
</pre>
    The intersection of the events "age &gt; n" and "age = n+1" is just
    the latter event. Thus we can compute the conditional probabilities
    of death at each age greater than n simply by dividing by their sum.
    <p> To get the conditional probabilities of death at each age given
      survival to age 50 for US women, use: </p>
    <pre> 
           Pf50 &lt;- Pf[age&gt;50]/sum(Pf[age&gt;50])
</pre>
    In other words, Pf50 contains the probability of death at each age
    past 50, given survival through age 50. This conditional
    distribution is a perfectly good probability distribution. The
    probabilities sum to 1:
    <pre> 
           sum(Pf50) 
</pre>
    We can compute the expected age at death, given survival to age 50,
    using this conditional distribution. This is known as the
    conditional life expectancy. The sample space is the set of possible
    outcomes (51:119), so using the definition of expectation, the
    conditional life expectancy for a US female surviving to age 50 is
    <pre>           sum(age[age&gt;50]*Pf50)
</pre>
    It is greater than the unconditional expected value - the
    unconditional life expectancy includes those who die at a younger
    age. It is not wildly different, though. To see why, look at the
    probability of survival past age 50:
    <pre> 
           sum(Pf[age&gt;50])
</pre>
