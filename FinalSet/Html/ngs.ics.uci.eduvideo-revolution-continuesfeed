		<description><![CDATA[Hi,
     for me just adding pictures to my blog increased the return rate 10 fold. I plan to start adding video pod casts soon to see how that works out. It costs me nothing execpt bandwidth and my own time - so its free.  I think adding such content (real home made videos about issues or jokey ones) is very different to being able to access &#039;media&#039; in other forms.  Like your PC, mobile phone or ipod.  &#039;media&#039; always has a price somewhere - it costs money to produce.  So someone has to pay - either us (99pence a download) or a rival company shutting its doors because they can&#039;t compete.

I think the next few years will cause a real change, more free publishers v&#039;s &#039;media&#039; produced content. Looking at itunes and napster I know where my money is.
