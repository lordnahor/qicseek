<h2>Flood Shelters Alert</h2>
The purpose of this application is to suggest safe locations to those people who may be trapped in flood. In order to realize the goal,
 we first classify the flooding areas into three groups based on the flooding situations as well as the sufficiency of shelters. 
 Then for those people who tweeted about flood from the dangerous areas, we send tweets to them and direct them to the nearest shelters in safe areas.<br>
The adjoining image shows flood severity levels for the recent floods in Thailand. EventShop not only lets users classify flood severity levels but also take action to notify a person within the affected region to go to the nearest relief shelter. We configured EventShop to look for tweets related to floods emanating from the affected zones in Thailand. Based on the severity level, the system may provide details of the nearest shelter location to the tweeter and recommend her to evacuate.<br>
