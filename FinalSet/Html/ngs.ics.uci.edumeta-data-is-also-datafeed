		<description><![CDATA[Interesting point of view. I&#039;ve always considered meta-data as more of a descriptor serving as an informational scaffold to be used to put the data in context.

The upside to considering both metadata and the actual data as equals in terms of the inherent value we could leverage a great number of &quot;inferences&quot;.  I would define an inference as different than a context as it utilizes data to infer some action has occurred or some new state exists, AND provides a contingency that best suits the new state. This creates a &quot;smart&quot;

These inferences could be an essential component of making our overall experience with data in our everyday lives more meaningful. To borrow your example above, we could create an inference from a picture&#039;s meta-data/data to formulate common use cases and make inferences. A real world example is demonstrated in Apple&#039;s iPhoto technology, which heavily utilizes meta-data/data, grouping photos into events based on the time and location data it captures. I think the creation of these inferences will eventually come to pervade our lives and those companies who identify and harness the power of the inferred dataset will thrive.

I must also mention that the more data we all generate the easier it will be to identify and infer useful, productive, creative technologies that are powered by  that data.]]></description>
