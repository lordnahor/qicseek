<h1>CS/CSE 161, Fall 2013:<br> Design and Analysis of Algorithms</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Instructors and office hours</h2>
<p>The course will be taught by <a href="/~eppstein/">David
Eppstein</a>, eppstein@uci.edu (office hours Mondays 1:30 - 2:30 and
Thursdays 2:00 - 3:00 in Bren Hall 4214). The teaching
assistant is <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~mbannist/">Michael
Bannister</a>, mbannist@uci.edu (office hours Mondays 5:00 - 6:00 in
Bren Hall 4219); in addition there are two readers.

<h2>Lectures and discussions</h2>
<p>The course meets for lectures Mondays, Wednesdays, and
Fridays, from 3:00 - 3:50, in Bren Hall, room 1100. In addition there
are two discussion sections, Wednesdays and Fridays 5:00 - 5:50 in the
same room. Students are required to be signed up for one of these
sections, and are expected to attend discussions regularly, but are not
required to attend the section they signed up for. At the discussion
sections, the teaching assistant will go over homework and midterm
solutions, give additional examples of topics covered in the lecture,
and be available to answer questions.</p>

<h2>Textbook</h2>
<p>The course text will be "Algorithm Design" by Goodrich and Tamassia. 
Students are expected to own a copy and to read the relevant chapters
and sections. The official version of the textbook is the one sold in
the bookstore. Most homework problems will be assigned from this text.
If you are using a different version (e.g., the
international version), then it is your responsibility to make sure you
are doing the correct homework problems.</p>

<h2>Homework and grading policy</h2>
<p>Coursework will consist of weekly homeworks (typically posted on this
web page on Mondays)
as well as twp midterms and a comprehensive final exam. The overall
grade will be determined 10% from homework, 25% from each midterm, and
40% from the final.</p>

<p>Group work on homeworks is permitted; each student
should turn in his or her own copy of the homeworks. Each week's
homework assignment will be given on this web page. Homework is due by
11:59pm on <s>Fridays</s> Sundays and must be turned in through dropbox
on eee. No late
homework will be accepted. Homework must be typed, and formatted as a
pdf file. Handwritten homework or homeworks in other formats will not be
graded. Students who add the class after the start of quarter will be
responsible for turning in all earlier homeworks by the following
Friday. The lowest homework score of the quarter will be dropped from
the course average.</p>

<p>Homework solutions will be posted
at <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~mbannist/solutions/">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~mbannist/solutions/</a> some time after the homework deadline has passed.</p>
