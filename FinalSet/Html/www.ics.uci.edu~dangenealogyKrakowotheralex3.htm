<H2>SEARCHING FOR ROOTS IN KRAKOW, POLAND</H2>
<H3>By George J. ALEXANDER</H3>
</center>


In October 1997 I spent a month examining original genealogical documents in the Krakow branch 
of the Polish National Archives, located at 16 Sienna Street, not far from the Krakow Main Post 
Office. Prior to going to Krakow I had written to the Main Office of the Archives in Warsaw on 
Dluga Street 6 and requested permission to have access to the Krakow branch, stating that I intend 
to write a book about the history of Krakow during the last to hundred years, using the history of 
my family as the starting point. In return I have received a formal notice, giving me the right to full 
access to documents that I might need.
<P>
Having lived in Krakow from 1925 to 1944 and having survived the Holocaust in Poland, I knew 
that my family was large and that my ancestors lived in Krakow for many generations. I knew that 
there were three related branches of my family living in Krakow prior to the Second World War. 
There were also some additional, more distant, relatives in Krakow as well. The three branches 
were grouped and colloquially known by the type of business that they ran or by their place of 
residence, as the Aleksandrowicz family with a leather business, or with a paper, stationery and art 
supplies business and as the Aleksandrowicz family living in Podgorze, an outlying region of 
Krakow, located across the Vistula River from the city center. My aim was to find out how long 
have my ancestors lived in Krakow, when did they begin to use the surname Aleksandrowicz or 
Alexandrowicz ("x" or "ks" being used interchangeably, with older documents using "x"), when did 
the name first appear in official records and how was the name derived. Also, I wanted to establish 
the exact relationship between the various branches of the Aleksandrowicz clan. And, incidentally, 
I wanted to revisit the places where I lived before and during the Second World War. I was able to 
establish a definite family tree of my Aleksandrowicz forebears in Krakow back in time to the year 
1783, but found little information about the name's origin. I did pay a sentimental visit to the 
assorted places in Krakow and vicinity which I remembered from before the War. 
<P>
Before he died in 1968 my father sat down with me and we made copious notes of family history. 
Also, he and I took notes of our conversations with an older relative, my father's aunt, Amalia 
Kaufer, who emigrated to America from Vienna in 1938. I found these notes invaluable. Having 
the names of the last three generations of my family saved me a lot of time and made my search 
much easier. Knowledge of old family stories and of legends about the family origin provided me 
with important clues. I believe that recording oral history from older family members should 
always be the first step in any genealogical research.
<P>
I began the search for my roots in the Krakow Archives with the latest records. A lot of 
information in them was fami1iar to me and I worked my way back in time as far as I could go. I 
used the records to augment and, if necessary, correct the information that I remembered or that 
my father provided me with.  Then I proceeded systematically back, checking records from 
193O's, 1920's, 1910's, 1900's, 1880's and beyond, including lists of inhabitants, birth, marriage 
and death records, conscription lists and census books back to 1790's, as well as business and 
professional lists and even phone directories from the thirties. I also checked some more recent 
documents of the present Krakow City Government and the one document available in the Jewish 
Community Council. The latter has only one list of cemetery burials extant, partly singed, having 
survived hidden in a chimney. All other books have been lost during the Nazi era. I have visited 
both the Remuh and the Miodowa Street Jewish cemeteries in Krakow and tried to read many of 
the tombstone inscriptions that remained after the Nazi depredations. I also consulted a number of 
secondary sources prior to my trip to Poland and reexamined them after my return in the light of 
my Krakow findings. These secondary sources proved extremely useful (A list of the records that 
I saw in Poland and of some of the other sources is appended).
<P>
I found the personnel of the Krakow Archives uniformly polite and most helpful. In particular, 
without the courteous and efficient assistance of the archivist Ms Aneta Szpilka I would not have 
been able to do as well as I did. I was told which documents were available and shown all that I 
requested.  While most Jewish rabbinical and communal records have been destroyed during the 
War, Jewish records kept by the Imperial Austrian officials specially designated to keep Jewish 
data (Krakow was under Austrian influence or a part of the Habsburg Empire for most of the time 
that I was interested in) are largely intact and most are kept in the Krakow Archives. These 
records are mostly in Polish, with some German.  The loss of the Jewish records means that the 
dates of purely religious marriages and burials are hard to find and are generally not available.
<P>
My knowledge of Polish was of tremendous help in my search in Krakow. Use of a translator, 
while necessary for anyone who does not know Polish, is not completely satisfactory, because 
besides knowledge of the language, knowledge of spellings and permutations of Jewish names, 
and awareness of Krakow Jewish history and customs is helpful in understanding the available 
records. Most current Polish translators do not have a thorough grounding in Jewish lore.
<P>
For example, traditionally, Krakow Jews did not name their children after living relatives but did 
name them after recently departed ones.  Thus, names tend to repeat themselves in Krakow 
Jewish genealogy every two-to-three generations or roughly every 50-80 years. This is often 
helpful in determining relationships, specially when the names are rather rare and unusual but part 
of a family tradition. Also, first names do not have to repeat themselves exactly. In the more 
recent times it was often enough for the first letter of a name in daily use to correspond to the 
name of the departed. It was customary for even non-religious Krakow Jews to have, in addition 
to their everyday first names, religious "Hebrew" names.  These Hebrew names were more likely 
to correspond to that of the deceased relative.  Thus, my father, Max Alexander, born in Krakow 
in 1902, used in everyday life in Poland the name of Maksymilian Aleksandrowicz, but also had a 
Hebrew name of Menashe ben Yaakov ha-Kohen after his great grandfather Menashe, born in 
Krakow in 1818.  The fact that my father carried that name told me that his great-grandfather 
Menashe, whose date of death I could not find, must have died before 1902. I was named Jerzy 
(diminutive Jurek, pronounced Yoo-rek) Aleksandrowicz, but also given a Hebrew name of 
Yitzhak ben Menashe ha-Kohen, after my mother's father, Isaac Rosenberg, who must have died 
prior to my birth, in 1925.
<P>
Jews lived in Poland since what were for Poland pre-historic times, i.e. from before the year 996 
A.D. In fact, it was a Jewish merchant and traveler, Abraham ben Jacob from Tortosa in Arab 
Spain, who first mentioned the town of Krakow in describing his travels in the 10-th century. It is 
likely that the first historic Polish monarchs (1000-1200 A.D.) had Jewish minters, inasmuch as 
coins with Hebrew lettering from Poland from that period exist. Formal recorded Jewish history 
in Poland begins in 1264 with the issuance of a protective charter to Jews by the ruler of the small 
Duchy of Kalisz, Boleslaw the Pious (1221-1279), making them wards of the ruler and offering 
protection of life and possessions.  King of Poland Casimir the Great (Kazimierz Wielki, 1310-
1370) issued such a protective covenant, covering the entire country. Casimir invited Jews to 
settle in his kingdom and even established in 1335 a Jewish community in a township that he 
founded near Krakow, which is named after him, Kazimierz (it was incorporated into the city of 
Krakow in 1791).  There is a legend in Poland that Casimir the Great had a Jewish mistress. Her 
name was said to be, appropriately enough, Esterka.
<P>
Krakow was the capital of the Polish Kingdom until the 17-th Century, when King Sigismund 
Vasa moved the capital to Warsaw. However, even later Krakow remained the place of 
coronation and final resting of Polish monarchs as well as the pre-eminent center of Polish  
culture. The removal of the capital allowed Krakow to avoid a lot of modernization and helped it 
to retain a lot of its mediaeval and Renaissance character.
<P>
Jews in Krakow settled in the area bounded today by St. Anne (once called Judengasse), 
Jagiellonska and Golebia Streets.  This was a time of great persecution of Jews in Western Europe 
and Casimir's Poland offered them a welcome refuge. By 1469 Krakow Jews had two 
synagogues, a communal bath, a school and two cemeteries. As in Worms in Germany, defending 
one of the defensive towers and gates in the wall surrounding mediaeval Krakow, was the 
responsibility of the Jews and the gate was known as the Jewish Gate. The gate is long gone but 
there is a memorial plaque on the spot where it stood. The Jewish land, located close to the town 
center, was coveted by Krakow's University, originally began by Casimir the Great in 1364 and 
chartered by King Wladyslaw Jagiello (hence the name Jagiellonian University).  Eventually, in 
1495 King Jan Olbracht expelled the Jews from Krakow proper, moved them to the nearby 
Kazimierz, and gave their land to the University, which is still located there.
<P>
The Kazimierz district, while at first a separate community and separated from the city by a river 
bed, was located within the shadow of the royal enclave on Wawel Hill, thus providing the Jews 
with royal protection. It was also within easy walking distance not only of the Castle but also of 
the city center. The Jews in Krakow and Kazimierz had good times and bad times, often reflecting 
the ups and downs of Poland and its economy. They continually struggled with Krakow burgers 
who tried to limit their trading rights. In 1453 the celebrated Italian rabble-rouser and anti-Semite, 
later canonized as St. John of Capistrano, came to Krakow, preached hatred for the Jews in his 
sermons and incited pogroms. A tablet commemorating Capistrano's visit can be seen on the wall 
of the Bernardine Cloister in Krakow, located on Bernardynska Street, where I lived prior to 
1940. In 1525 a renowned Talmudic scholar Reb Moses Isserles (Remuh) was born in Krakow. 
The only presently functioning Krakow synagogue was founded by Remuh' father. In 16-th 
Century the Polish Jews had a considerable degree of autonomy. Their taxes were regulated by a 
Jewish Parliament, the Council of Four Lands (Vaad Arba Aratzot) established in 1549 and 
lasting for more than two hundred years. This Jewish Parliament, unique in history, controlled 
relations between communities, established local Jewish courts, ritual slaughterhouses and ritual 
baths and maintained charities and poorhouses.
<P>
In 1648 the peasants and the Cossacks in then Polish Ukraine rebelled, under the leadership of 
Bogdan Chmielnicki, against Polish landowners.  Not being able to reach the hated magnates who 
were safe in their palaces in Warsaw, Krakow or Paris, the rebels wreaked their vengeance on 
Jewish "arendars" (holders of rights to collect taxes owed to the nobility), rural tavern keepers and 
others.  Large number of Jews in the eastern reaches of the Polish territories perished, some 
escaped to Krakow. A Swedish Lutheran invasion that followed the Cossack attacks also 
contributed to the impoverishment of the country, which included Krakow's Jewish population. In 
1783 the first person documented to later carry the Aleksandrowicz name was born. In 1784 was 
born his future wife, Dobrysh Freindel, daughter of Jacob called Gumple, later known as 
Gumplowicz. In 1790, under the last Polish King, Stanislaw August Poniatowski, a census of 
Jews was undertaken, listing those living in royal towns like Krakow and Kazimierz, but also in 
privately owned small towns and villages, whose owners certified the listing of "their" Jews. I 
have examined the original pages of this census, covering the Krakow district and parts of 
Southwestern Poland in the Krakow Archives on Sienna Street and found indications that my 
ancestors lived in Krakow at least since 1725. There is a later census, made by the Austrians when 
they came to Krakow in 1796. In this census, too, there are indications of my Aleksandrowicz 
forebears living in Krakow at least from 1700. 
<P>
There were two comprehensive listings of inhabitants of the Jewish Town of Kazimierz prepared
toward the end of the eighteenth century, one in 1790, the other in 1796. I have serious 
reservations about the dates at which these were supposedly prepared. Judging by the recorded 
ages of my ancestors in the two lists, the data must have been provided to the census takers at 
times other than the formal dates of the publications. There are striking similarities between the 
two records and general internal consistencies about the ages of the individual family members in 
each, but significant differences between the two records, which can only be reconciled by 
assuming that some of the data was post-dated or pre-dated when entered. The first census, in 
Polish, was done when Krakow was still a part of independent Poland, around 1790; the second, 
in German, was taken by the Austrians who occupied Krakow in 1796. My ancestors appear in 
both. In the Austrian list there appears a boy named Joseph, and a girl named Dobrysz (Dobosch), 
who are likely to be the ones who later married. As in their marriage record, Joseph is one year 
older than Dobrysh. Her father is Jacob Gumple, his Herschel, son of David. Her mother is Sara, 
of the Abeles, his is Rifka of the Jekeles. Jacob appears to have been born around 1760, Sara 
around 1766, Herschel around 1764, Rifka around 1765. In the Polish census no children were 
listed, but Joseph's father and mother are listed as Herszla Dawidowicz, 30, and Rywka, 28. In 
both lists, Herschel has an older brother, Jacob, who is married to Rifka's sister, Judith of the 
Jekeles.
<P>
Between 1772 and 1796 Poland was being invaded by the armies of Russia, Austria and Prussia. 
In 1794, the great Polish patriot and a hero of American Revolution, Tadeusz Kosciuszko, led an 
uprising against Tsarist armies from Krakow. With his American experience, Kosciuszko saw that 
Polish aristocracy alone cannot win a war against the invaders; he therefore tried to enlist peasants 
and Jews in his army. He offered peasants relief from serfdom and Jews emancipation.  He did 
have a Jewish battalion led by colonel Berek, son of Yosel (Berek Yoselewicz). Initially 
successful, the Kosciuszko armies were eventually defeated by superior forces and by 1796 
Poland was erased from the map of Europe. Krakow was occupied by the armies of Austria. 
Austrian emperors insisted that their subjects have family names, i.e. surnames. Krakow Jews, 
who until then mostly used patronymics, nicknames and such, gradually began to adapt surnames. 
Having been recorded by Austrian officials, the surnames usually had a Germanic cast.  
<P>
Early in the 19-th Century, Napoleon Bonaparte, leading victorious French armies, created a 
Duchy of Warsaw and in 1809, after the battle of Wagram, Krakow was attached to the Duchy. 
Napoleon was defeated in 1812 and in 1815 the Congress of Vienna awarded the Duchy of 
Warsaw to the Tsar as King of Poland. However, the city of Krakow with Kazimierz and its 
Jewish Town (where all Jews had to live) became a small independent republic, governed by a 
Senate. The "Free, independent and strictly neutral" Krakow Republic lasted until 1846, when it 
was incorporated into the Austrian province of Galitzia. In 1818 my ancestor Menashe 
Aleksandrowicz was born. In 1845 Menashe had a son, my great-grandfather Jozef 
Aleksandrowicz (1845-1940), whom I knew when I was little. Three years later, in 1848, Franz 
Josef of Habsburg became emperor. At first an inexperienced young man, Franz Jozef eventually 
became a wise and rather permissive ruler.  Provinces of the empire received a lot of autonomy, 
which meant that all governmental affairs in Krakow were conducted in Polish. Restrictions on 
Jews were gradually eliminated.  By 1867 they could live anywhere in Krakow, not only in the 
Jewish area of Kazimierz.  They received the right to vote and sent representatives to the 
Parliament in Vienna.  They joined the Krakow Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and they 
studied, in numbers, at the Jagiellonian University. Among those who got their doctorates at this 
University were two of my uncles, both lawyers, Ignacy and Wilhelm Aleksandrowicz. The Jews 
generally fared well under the benign Habsburg rule and nearly worshipped the old Franz Josef.
<P>
After World War I (1914-1918) Poland regained its independence.  A large Jewish minority of 
more than 10% of the total population, living among a very strongly Catholic populace was bound 
to have problems. The coexistence was never easy or free of rancor. Jew-baiting was always a 
sure-fire method for ambitious politicians to garner votes.  Some honest Polish patriots believed 
that it was their patriotic duty to try to rid Poland of Jews and to accomplish it not by violence but 
through an economic boycott, hoping that impoverishing the Jews would force them to emigrate 
from the country.  Among those who called for such a boycott was the leader of the anti-Semitic 
National Democratic Party Roman Dmowski, who along with Ignace Jan Paderewski represented 
Poland at the Treaty of Versailles, and a prominent Roman-Catholic priest, Maksymilian Kolbe, 
who was beatified by the present Pope.
<P>
In Warsaw's St. John's Cathedral there is a memorial plaque to Roman Dmowski (1864-1959) 
with this quote from his writings: "Catholicism is not an addition to Polonism - it is imbedded in 
its essence. Attempts to separate Catholicism from Polonism would destroy the very essence of 
the nation", which explains the rationale behind his virulent anti-Semitism. Prior to 1939 Father 
Kolbe, who was later shot by the Nazis, founded a large catholic publishing enterprise which 
included a journal "Dziennik Niepokalanej" (Virgin's Daily"), that had as its primary purpose 
advocacy of a boycott of Jewish enterprises. It is indeed a pity that in a country as poor as was 
Poland between the two World Wars, seemingly intelligent and honest patriots spent so much 
energy trying to impoverish 10% of the population, instead of welcoming the fact that some 
citizens and taxpayers were innovative entrepreneurs whose domestic and international activities 
were enriching the country.
<P>
I was born in 1925. At the time my family owned two elegant apartment buildings on 
Bernardynska Street in Krakow, facing the Royal Castle on Wawel Hill. From my window I could 
see the Castle Keep. As I remember it, in spite of all political problems in Poland, life in Krakow 
in the 1930's was fairly pleasant for well-to-do Jews and non-Jews alike. Krakow, then a city of 
250,000 inhabitants, of which 60,000 were Jewish, was a center of culture, with many outstanding 
educational institutions.  The Jews fully participated in the town's lively cultural, social and 
political life. All of this ended, of course, when the German troops entered in September of 1939. 
Jews were herded into a Ghetto, not in Kazimierz but in the outlying district of Podgorze.  From 
the ghetto, most people, including all elderly and children (among them my mother and my 11-
year-old sister), were deported to the extermination center in Belzec. The rest were taken to a 
concentration camp in Krakow-Plaszow nearby, described in the book and movie "Schindler's 
List". As the Russian armies were approaching in 1944, surviving camp inmates, myself included, 
were shipped to concentration camps in Austria. Krakow, in the meantime, existed without Jews.
<P>
After the war, surviving Jews were not greeted with friendly hugs, their possessions having been 
appropriated in their absence.  The Polish Communists, among them some Jews, were beholden to 
Russia, which did not endear them to the strongly anti-Russian catholic population.  There was a 
major pogrom in Kielce in central Poland in which many people were killed, and a minor one in 
Krakow, with "only" one or two victims. Most of the remaining Jews, except for a few who 
intermarried with non-Jews, emigrated when the Communists began an anti-Jewish campaign in 
the 196O's. Today, the Krakow Jewish commune has 189 registered members. There are also a 
few people of Jewish origin who do not necessarily consider themselves Jewish. Anti-Semitism 
without Jews is still a potent force in Poland, but there is also a curious revival of interest in Jews 
and their culture among young Poles. A well-attended Jewish Cultural Festival is being held each 
June. In Kazimierz there is now a Jewish branch of the Polish National Museum, there are 
"Jewish" restaurants featuring what purports to be typical Jewish food and in front of one of these 
restaurants are non-Jews dressed like Hasidic Jews.  This "revival" is very sad and pathetic.   I see 
no future for Jews in Krakow.  A proud long history of many centuries has come to an end.
<P>
As stated above, until the fall of Poland in 1796 Krakow Jews did not use last names, they mostly 
used patronymics, places of origin, nicknames or professions. In Yiddish, which was then the 
lingua franca of Krakow Jews, as in German, patronymics took the form of adding an "s" at the 
end of father's name. Thus, Israel, the father of the Krakow sage, Reb Moses ben Israel (Remuh, 
1525-1572), was known by his nickname, Isserl. His son became known as Moses Isserls or 
Isserless. In Polish, the comparable term is "z", meaning "of". Thus, Dobrysz, wife of Jozef 
Aleksandrowicz, was listed in the 1818 record of the birth of her son as "Dobrysz z Jakubow", i.e. 
Dobrysz of the Jacobs. In conformity with the then common Polish usage the father's name could 
also be used with an ending "-wicz".  For example Berek, son of Josel, the leader of the Jewish 
battalion in Kosciuszko's army, was known as Berek Joselewicz.  His son was Berkowicz. In this 
manner, Dobrysz Aleksandrowicz, daughter of Jacob Gumple is listed in a document of marriage 
of her daughter, Rywka, in 1831, as Dobrysz z Gumplowiczow, i.e. Dobrysh of the 
Gumplowiczes. The Polish word for "butcher" is "rzeznik".  The butcher's son is referred to, in 
the 1790 census, as Jebl Rzeznikowicz. A physician's son is known as Doktorowicz. In German or 
Yiddish a tailor would be known as Schneider, a carpenter as Tischler, a jeweler as Goldschmidt. 
In Russian part of Poland the same men would be referred to as Kravetz, Stolar and Zlotnik or 
Slotnick.
<P>
If a Jew from Dresden in Saxony came to Krakow he would be known as Dresdner or Drezner 
(my great-grandmother's maiden name), if he came from Brody he would be referred to as Broder, 
if he came from Frankfurt as Frankfurter. If a Krakow Jew left for Vienna or Berlin he would be 
referred to, in the Yiddish or German mode, as Krakauer; if he left for Warsaw or St. Petersburg, 
he might be known, in the Polish or Russian mode, as Krakowski. It is important, however, to 
remember that these were not family names at that point in time, but patronymics or indications of 
profession or place of origin, although many of them eventually ended up by being adopted as 
surnames. In the light of the above, I believe that the simplest explanation for the origin of the 
name Aleksandrowicz, first used in 1807, is that of having an ancestor named Alexander.
<P>
In 1787 the Austrian emperor, Jozef II, ordered that all his subjects must have family names. As 
Krakow became Austrian in 1794, Krakow Jews gradually assumed surnames. Those who were 
registered by Austrian clerks got Germanic names: Goldberg, Schwartzstein, Rosenwald, 
Birnbaum, Bernstein, Feldman, etc. In the birth records that I have consulted in Krakow, 
surnames began to appear in 1805. The first Jews with surnames that I found were Berl 
Luxenberg, Hillel Rosenzweig and Abraham Anisfeld. The first use of the name Birnbaum (my 
grandmother's name) occurred in 1806, the first use of Aleksandrowicz (actually "Alexa...") in 
1807. How come Jozef Aleksandrowicz, born in 1783, selected or was given such a non-
Germanic sounding surname, I was not able to establish.
<P>
In the book registering births in the Jewish Town in Kazimierz in the year 1818 Jozef 
Aleksandrowicz and Dobrysz, daughter of the Jacobs, had a son, whom they named Samuel Aron. 
There are no further records of Samuel Aron, but many records of a man who calls himself 
Menashe (Manasse) Aleksandrowicz, who was born on the same date in 1818 and whose mother 
had the rather rare name of Dobrysz. I am certain that Samuel Aron and Menashe are one and the 
same individual.  According to the birth certificate (see enclosed copy translated into English) in 
1818 Jozef was thirty four, Dobrysz thirty two years old. They lived in Building 203 in the Jewish 
Town in Kazimierz. In 1821 Jozef and Dobrysz had a second son, Izrael Eliasz. In 1818 they both 
were rather old to have a first child. When we searched records prior to 1818 we found birth 
records of three daughters and, eventually, a record of two more. In 1805 Jozef had a girl named 
Schoendel. In 1807 Jozef "Alexa...", living in Building 203 in Kazimierz, had a daughter, 
Temerle. In 1809 another girl, Ryvka, was born, but the record of her birth is missing. We know 
of her existence from her wedding announcement of 1831. In 1811, also in building 203, Josef 
Alexander and Dobrysz, daughter of the Jacobs, had a daughter named Gele, in 1813 another 
daughter, Hana.
<P>
The first record to mention the name Aleksandrowicz, or something approaching it, occurs in 
1807. The 1807 record is blurred and hard to read, the last name given as Alexa... or Alexe..., the 
wife's name is not Dobrysz but what looks like Freindel. In 1813, 1818 and 1821 this wife is 
listed as Dobrysz. However, we found a later document, from 1827, where both names are shown 
and she is listed as Freindel Dobrysz. In a still later document, from 1831, she is listed as 
"Dobress z Gomplowiczow", i. e. as Dobress of the Gomplowiczes. This establishes that her 
father was Jacob Gumplowicz. The name Dobrysz was new to me, as was the name Temerle. 
However, I found that the name Temerl was fairly popular in the 1800's. Indeed, in mid 1800's a 
nephew of Temerle Aleksandrowicz, Nachman, son of Israel Eliasz, had a daughter whom he 
named Temerl.  In the old Jewish cemetery at the Remuh Synagogue there are two tombstones to 
Dobrosz or Dobrysz, who died in 1642.  She was the daughter of the famous Krakow cabalist 
Nathan Spira (1585-1633).  The Polish word "dobroc'", roughly pronounced "dobrotch", means 
goodness. Thus, the name Dobrysz may be a Polish translation of the common Jewish names Gitl 
or Guta. The name Alexander was also rare among Krakow Jews. However, the historian Meyer 
Balaban, in his important book of history of Krakow Jews, shows in the Remuh family tree, that 
Remuh's sister married Alexander ha-Kohen.  Another Alexander appears as the father of one of 
Remuh' students, Joshua Falk ben Alexander ha-Kohen, author of a commentary to Shulkhan 
Arukh. In a book on Jewish trade in Krakow in the 15-th and 16-th Century published by the 
Krakow Academy of Arts and Sciences there is a listing of an Aleksander Jozefowicz, i.e. 
Alexander son of Jozef. I have not been able to establish if there is any connection between this 
prominent Cracovian merchant and the subsequent decision, one hundred years later, by Jozef son 
of David to adopt "Aleksandrowicz" as his family name.
<P>
There exists a family legend specifying that we are related to Remuh, not descended from, but 
related. If we assume that Jewish names repeat themselves every two or three generations, then 
our patriarch Jozef Aleksandrowicz may be a descendant of Alexander Jozefowicz or of the 
Alexander who married Remuh's sister. His wife Dobrysz may be a descendant of Dobrysz, 
daughter of Nathan Spira. Remuh claimed that he established his descent from Rashi (c.1040-
1105), the great sage of Troyes, Mainz and Worms. Rashi, in turn, claimed descent from the 
Royal House of Judah. Allowing for a little poetic license, my ancestor Jozef Aleksandrowicz 
may have been a descendant of King David.
<P>
Jozef Aleksandrowicz's son Menashe (1818-<1902) married Lea nee Katzner and had four sons: a 
first born named after the deceased founder of the family, Jozef (1845-1940), a second son David, 
who must have died young because he does not appear in any subsequent documents, a third son 
Feivel (Filip, 1849-1909) and the youngest Wolf (1850-1888).  The three branches of the family 
stem from these three surviving brothers.  The other relatives are descended from Menashe's 
brother, the first Jozef's other son, Israel Eliasz (1821- ?). The second Jozef Aleksandrowicz, born 
in 1845, grandson and namesake of the first Jozef, married Rachel daughter of Saul Drezner, a 
tavern keeper in Krakow and had three sons and four daughters.  Filip Aleksandrowicz, born in 
1849, married Dorothea, daughter of Jonas Fraenkel, a descendant of the rabbi of Raciborz and 
had five sons and two daughters.  Wolf Aleksandrowicz married Regina, daughter of Salomon 
Hirsch, a tavern keeper in Tarnow, and had two sons and three daughters.  All these cousins. 
except one, married into prominent Krakow families and had many children.  While many 
members of this and next generation died during the Holocaust, many live today all over the 
world, in New York, Israel, California, Hawaii, Poland, Argentina, England, and elsewhere.
<P>
Jozef Aleksandrowicz's son Jacob (1866-1935) established a wholesale leather import/export 
enterprise in Krakow with a branch in Kielce, Poland. Before 1939 this business imported leather 
from Czechoslovakia, Germany, England and the United States (from the Allied Kid Company of 
Philadelphia). Wolf's wife Regina (1853-1940) founded a wholesale-and-retail stationery, paper 
goods and art supplies store on the corner of Dluga and Basztowa Streets in Krakow that became 
the premier source for generations of Krakow schoolchildren and young Polish artists. When a 
struggling artist could not pay for needed sketch paper or other supplies he often received them 
for free and, in recompense, sketched or painted a portrait of Regina's young daughter, Roza 
Aleksandrowicz (1886-1973).  Many such portraits exist, one of them is hanging at the top of the 
stairs leading to the main dining room of the renowned Krakow restaurant Hawelka in Krakow's 
main square, the Rynek Glowny. Filip's descendants established a mattress factory in Podgorze 
and became major real estate owners in that district.

I remember my great-grandfather Jozef as an old man whom I visited with my father in the 
nineteen thirties. He had to be told which of his many grandchildren is my father. He spoke 
Yiddish or German. His oldest son Jacob Aleksandrowicz (1866-1935) was my grandfather. He 
married Anna (1866-1923), daughter of Isaac Mendel Birnbaum, sister of the cantor and 
composer Eduard Birnbaum (1855-1920), collector of Jewish lithurgical music. Jacob and Anna 
had five sons and two daughters.  All of them married and had one or two children.  My father 
was Maksymilian Aleksandrowicz (1902-1968). He married Salomea nee Rubin (1901-1942), 
daughter of Isaac Rosenberg, son of the Rabbi of Klasno/Wieliczka near Krakow. I was born in 
Paris in 1925 where my mother was studying.  After my birth my parents returned to Krakow.  
My sister Anna was born in 1931. My father ran the family leather business and was also 
politically active, running for a seat on the City Council on behalf of the Jewish Labor Bund. In 
1939 my father was drafted into the Polish army and fought the Germans. When the Soviet armies 
back-stabbed Poland from the East, the Polish army disintegrated. My father could not return to 
Krakow where the Gestapo was looking for him and he moved to Vilna and eventually, with the 
help of the Jewish Labor Committee, and the Japanese Consul in Lithuania, Sugihara, to New 
York, where he changed his name to Max Alexander. He remarried in New York, his second wife 
being Roza nee Luksemburg. He died in 1968.
<P>
My mother (Salomea Scheindel Aleksandrowicz, nee Rubin) was a pre-school teacher, a follower 
of Maria Montessori. In Krakow, she ran the first Montessori kindergarten. My mother and my 
sister were deported from the Krakow Ghetto in October 1942 to the extermination center in 
Belzec in Poland and never heard from again. I was 14 when the war broke out, having completed 
grade school  (St. Adalbert School on Biskupia Street) and part of secondary school (the King 
John III Sobieski Gimnasium) in Krakow. When the Nazis came the schools were closed. I 
worked at first as a bookbinder trainee and, for a while outside of the Ghetto, as a shoemaker 
trainee. This latter enabled me to serve as a messenger for the underground, maintaining 
communication between Jewish and Polish secret organizations in Krakow (the Jewish Labor 
Bund and the WRN branch of the Polish Socialist Party, respectively), carrying and distributing 
secretly printed leaflets and newspapers. My underground activities have been described in the 
memoirs of the courageous Jewish Labor Bund courier during the war, Jacob Celemenski, 
published in New York in 1963.  After March 1943 I was in the Krakow-Plaszow concentration 
camp. In 1944 I was transferred to the camps in Austria.  Liberated in May 1945 I came to the US 
in 1946, graduated from Hobart College in 1949 and Rutgers University in 1953 with a doctorate 
in chemistry and microbiology.  I abbreviated my name from Jerzy Aleksandrowicz to George 
Alexander.  In 1958 I joined the faculty of Columbia University, became an Associate Professor 
of Biochemical Psychiatry and Chief of a Behavioral Toxicology Laboratory at the New York 
State Psychiatric Institute. I retired in 1992. In 1958 I married Rita, daughter of Sigmund 
Birnbaum of Fuerth in Bavaria and New York and of Sarena nee Feldman of Kisvarda in Hungary 
and New York. We have a son, Mark.
<P>
When the war broke out in 1939 I had 21 immediate relatives living in Krakow, uncles, aunts, 
first cousins. Of these only three survived: myself, my father and my father's oldest brother 
Ignacy. My father and uncle Ignacy came to the US in 1941 through Vilna, the Soviet Union and 
Japan. I survived in the concentration camps. One of my uncles died in Russia. The 17 other 
members of my immediate family were killed by the Nazis.  Thus, my family can serve as rebuttal 
to those who claim that the Holocaust never happened.
<P>
In my search for roots in Krakow, I have been able to establish that our family name first 
appeared in official documents in Krakow 192 years ago, at first as "Alexa" then as "Alexander" 
and eventually, in 1818, as "Aleksandrowicz", but I did not find out how it was derived. I have 
been able to correlate some events in the history of Krakow, the ancient coronation and burial site 
of Polish kings and a free Krakow Republic (1815-1846), with events in our family, which during 
the first third of the twentieth century was wealthy and influential in that town. I have found out 
the exact relationship between the three branches of the family.
<P>
There remain a lot of lacunae in the Aleksandrowicz history and more work needs to be done, 
particularly in connection with collateral branches.  For example, I have received a family tree of 
my wife, the Birnbaums from Fuerth in Bavaria, going back to the l6-th century.  My wife's 
mother's family, the Feldmans of Kisvarda in Hungary and Sub-Carpathia, also have a detailed 
family history.  My mother's father, Isaac Rosenberg came from Klasno near Wieliczka, a salt-
mine town near Krakow.  In Krakow, my grandmother's people, also named Birnbaum (a 
coincidence?) lived and prospered, as have the relatives of my great-grandmother, the Drezners. 
Other family names, related to ours are (in alphabetical order): Bader, Bal, Blonder, Chelouche, 
Davidson, Fallick, Frisch, Groner, Gumplowicz, Herrstein, Infeld, Jezower, Kaufer, 
Kleinhaendler, Klipper, Luksemburg, Mercado, Mikolajewicz, Muller, Neuger, Neuman, 
Obersky, Pitzele, Polenz, Queller, Rakower, Rosenberg, Schall, Schmerler, Schoenfeld, 
Shimshowitz, Spatz, Spritzer, Steinberg, Steiner, Szymanski, Uberall, Wayne, Weindling, 
Weinberg, Weinstein, Weinstock, Wien, and Zeliger. Any information about the relation of the 
above to the Aleksandrowicz family would be welcome. Anyone interested in relatives in 
Krakow, somehow connected to my family, is welcome to contact me at (914) 472-3370
