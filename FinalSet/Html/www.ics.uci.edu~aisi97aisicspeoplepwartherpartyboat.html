Our party boat is a 54 foot vessel, know as "Blue Moon", equipped to handle up
to 50 people for fishing purposes.  It has two 700 gallon bait tanks, one on
each end.  There are sleeping facilities below decks, designed to accomodate
everyone on board.  Our boat also features a full sized galley, and for the
not quite as avid fisherman, there is even a television in the galley.</p>
<p>
At our captain's disposal are the latest satellite navigation systems: the
most advanced fish finding sonar and infared equipment and a direct radio
line to air patrols in case they fishing hot spots.</p>
<p>
Overall, "Blue Moon" is one of the most advanced fishing cruisers on the water.
This coupled with the expertise of our captains will insure a great fishing
experience for your money.</p>
