				Impromptu Workspace allows users to share files and collaborately view
				and editing these files.
			</p><p>
				Each user is presented with the same GUI. The GUI has a Pie in the center. 
				Within the pie, each user is represented by a slice. Each shared file is 
				represented by a dot. The local user's slice looks
				darker than other slices. Each slice displays what files that user is sharing. Each 
				user can pick a color, which is used to depict the name of the user, a colorful marker 
				on the edge of the pie, and all files shared by that user.
			</p><p>
				The outside of the pie represents the private space of a local user, where the user can put files 
				that the user does not want to share yet. 
			</p><p>
				The owning user can do anything with files that the user shares. For other users, the 
				possible operations are determined by the sharing degree of a shared file. There are 
				four degrees of sharing. The "see only" files, which are put in the outer
				outermost ring (excluding the colorful edge), are files that other users can be aware
				of their existence but can do no more operations. The "read only" files, whic are
				put in the second outermost ring, are files that other users can read. The "read/write"
				files, which are put in the ring that is near the center circle, are files that others
				can not only read but also modify. Finally, the "persistent" files, which are put
				in the center circle, are files that shared by one user but will be continually served
				by another user even after the original owing user leaves.
			</p></div><div class="subsection"><a name="Transient_Sessions"></a><h3>Transient Sessions</h3><p>
				When you start Impromptu Workspace, the Workspace starts fresh, sharing no files
			to others. You need to import files that you want to share. 
			</p><p>
				When you start, the Workspace displays what files other users are sharing.
			</p><p>
				When you exit the Workspace, all your files will no longer be shared, unless
				they are put in the persisten space, in which case another user will keep serving these
				files. 
			</p></div><div class="subsection"><a name="Flat_and_Shared_Name_Space"></a><h3>Flat and Shared Name Space</h3><p>
				The Impromptu Workspace does not allow sharing directories. You can share all
				files under a directory, though. 
			</p><p>
				If another user already shares a file with a certain name, you can no longer share
				a file with the same name. You either need to rename the file, or wait until that
				user leaves the shared Workspace. 
			</p></div></div><div class="section"><a name="Import_Files"></a><h2>Import Files</h2><p>There are two ways to import files that you want to share with others.</p><div class="subsection"><a name="Use_Drag_and_Drop"></a><h3>Use Drag and Drop</h3><p>You can drag a set of files from your native application (Windows Explorer or
				Mac Finder) and drop them onto the Workspace. These files will be imported and
				displayed at the drop point. The drop point also determines what other users
				can do with these shared files, based on what ring the drop point belongs to.
			</p></div><div class="subsection"><a name="Use_Menu"></a><h3>Use Menu</h3><p>You can select the "Import Files to Workspace" menu item from the "File" manu, 
				and choose files you want to import. You can choose multiple files, even all files,
				under a directory. These files will be imported to your private space.  </p></div><div class="subsection"><a name="Notification_of_File_Sharing"></a><h3>Notification of File Sharing</h3><p>
				When another user shares a new file, a dot is created for this file, and it 
				blinks a couple seconds.
			</p></div></div><div class="section"><a name="Manipulate_Files"></a><h2>Manipulate Files</h2><div class="subsection"><a name="Change_File_Sharing_Degree_or_Position"></a><h3>Change File Sharing Degree or Position</h3><p> 
				You can change the position of your file by dragging a file to a 
				new place.
			</p><p>
				If the place lies in a different ring than the original ring, the
				new ring determines the new sharing level of the file.
			</p></div><div class="subsection"><a name="View_and_Edit_a_File"></a><h3>View and Edit a File</h3><p>
				You can double click the file. The native application associated 
				with the file will launch and open the file for editing.
			</p><p>
				You can right click on the file, and choose the "Open" item from
				the pop up menu.
			</p></div><div class="subsection"><a name="Notification_of_File_Access"></a><h3>Notification of File Access</h3><p>
				When a file shared by one user is accessed by another user, the dot's ring 
				color is changed to match the accessing user's color.
			</p></div></div><div class="section"><a name="Delete_a_File"></a><h2>Delete a File</h2><p>
			You can right click on the file, and choose the "Delete" item from
			the pop up menu. The file will be deleted from the shared repository.
		</p></div><div class="section"><a name="Export_Changed_files"></a><h2>Export Changed files</h2><p>
			If any of the shared files that you own are changed by either you or other users, when you exit, 
			the Workspace asks you whether you want to save the changes or not. Choose yes
			to save the changes. (It will overwrite the original copy of the file.)
		</p><p>
			You can also use "File/Save My Changed Files" to save changes during normal operation.
		</p><p>
			You can right click on the file, and choose the "Save" item from
			the pop up menu.
		</p><p>
			When you choose the "Delete" item from the pop up menu, if the file has been modified,
			you will also be asked whether you want to save the changes.
		</p></div><div class="section"><a name="File_System_Integration"></a><h2>File System Integration</h2><div class="subsection"><a name="Use_Regular_File_System_operations"></a><h3>Use Regular File System operations</h3><p>
				Impromptu Workspace mount the shared workspace as a regular file system drive or directory,
				thus allowing any applications of your operating systems access the shared files. 
				You can treat it like an integrated part of your file system and operate with 
				your familar tools. On Windows, the default drive is "I". On Mac, the defaul
				mount point is "/Volumes/Impromptu".
			</p></div><div class="subsection"><a name="Unreliable_&quot;net_use&quot;_on_Windows"></a><h3>Unreliable "net use" on Windows</h3><p>
				On Windows, for some reason the "net use" command used by Impromptu Workspace does not always
				function correctly. If you receive an error that reports mount failure, you can try 
				to restart Impromptu Workspace. Or you can log off Windows, log on again, and restart Impromptu Workspace.
			</p><p>
				During test, you can manually type, in a command prompt window, the command "net use 
				i: http://localhost/files /user:Username password". You might need to try several times.
				If Windows reports an error of 1219 (Conflicting credentials), then you have to log off Windows, 
				log on again, and restart Impromptu Workspace.
			</p></div></div><div class="section"><a name="Change_visual_display"></a><h2>Change visual display</h2><div class="subsection"><a name="Zoom"></a><h3>Zoom</h3><p>
				You can choose "Zoom In" and "Zoom Out" from the "View" menu to zoom in and zoom out the dipaly.
			</p></div><div class="subsection"><a name="Change_Dot_Size"></a><h3>Change Dot Size</h3><p>
				You can choose "Increase Dot Size" and "Descrease Dot Size" from the "View" menu to 
				increase or decrease the size of dots by 10%, respectively.
			</p></div><div class="subsection"><a name="Show_Tip_Message"></a><h3>Show Tip Message</h3><p>
				If you want to see the description for files, check the "Show Tip Message" 
				item from the "View" menu.
			</p></div><div class="subsection"><a name="Change_Color_of_Your_Slice"></a><h3>Change Color of Your Slice</h3><p>
				You can choose the "Change color..." item from the "View" menu. Select a color
				you want to use for your slice and your files. 
			</p><p>
				Your choice will be picked up by other present users. A user joins after you
				change your color WILL NOT pick up your change (and still uses your old color for display).
			</p><p>
				Your chosen color is saved when you exit. When you come back, the 
				color you choose last time is used.
