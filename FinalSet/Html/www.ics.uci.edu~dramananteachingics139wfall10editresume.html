<P>  <FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Because this assignment is very short, you
      should have <I>at least two of your classmates</I> edit it (and you should
      edit two of your classmates&#39; papers).  Try to work with people you haven&#39;t
      worked with before.  (There&#39;s a separate page of guidelines for the
  promotion piece; consult that one if you&#39;re doing that alternative.) </FONT></P>
<OL TYPE="I">
<LI>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Talk to the author. What kind of job does
the author want?  What does the author think are his or her strongest points
or best qualifications?  weakest points or shortcomings?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Read your classmate&#39;s work once through
without making any comments.  Then, write down briefly your first impressions:</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<OL TYPE="A">
<LI>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Are both the letter and the r&eacute;sum&eacute;
clean, clear, professional, and perfectly correct?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Does it contain anything alienating or off-putting?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Would it make you want to hire the author
if you were hiring people for the kind of job the author wants?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
</OL>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Read it again, more carefully, making specific
comments in the margins. </FONT></LI>
<BR>
<OL TYPE="A">
<LI>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Consider the r&eacute;sum&eacute;:</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<OL TYPE="1">
<LI>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Does it include all the author&#39;s appropriate
qualifications?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Does it indicate any gaps or other areas that
need more explanation?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Does it include any inappropriate material?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Does it use consistent, parallel language?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Does it list concrete accomplishments for
each position held (where appropriate and available)?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Does it give indications, where applicable,
of good communication skills, of the ability to work with others, of leadership
skills?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Can you list three ways in which the typography
and design actually <I>help</I> the r&eacute;sum&eacute; do its job?  Can
you list ways in which they interfere, and suggest improvements?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
</OL>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Consider the cover letter:</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<OL TYPE="1">
<LI>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Does the letter follow an appropriate form?
 Does it use consistent, parallel language?  Is the tone appropriate?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Does the author highlight the qualifications
most likely to get him or her an interview for the job?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>If something in the author&#39;s r&eacute;sum&eacute;
might raise serious questions with a potential employer, does the cover
letter deal with them adequately without drawing undue attention to them?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
</OL>
</OL>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Review your comments with the author (and
vice versa).  Be sure to write &quot;Edited by&quot; and your name on the
copy you edited.  Give your comments to the author, who must include them
with his or her turned-in version.  Be sure you get comments from your editors,
too.</FONT></LI>
