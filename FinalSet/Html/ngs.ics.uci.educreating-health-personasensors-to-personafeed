		<description><![CDATA[Prof. Ramesh Jain,

Loved going through your note above;very though provoking and creative, which I could relate to. From the beginning I have always felt that the Medical system that we follow needs to be reformed and modified. The biggest anomaly that I find is, though we are all aware that each and every human being, though structurally similar,  is unique in his own way based on his genetic and biological and genetic back ground. Added to this his personal lifestyle , habits, food intake etc make him  a lot different from his other compatriots. However when he falls sick and visits a physician for treatment, he is made to go through a  standard diagnostic process based on a universally conventional logical process, and then treated with medicines which again are of general nature. No wonder such a treatment, though manages to heal the patient for the present disease is most likely to create side effects, which in the long run could be extremely detrimental to him. 

The increase in the number of cancer patients and other life threatening diseases and viruses I feel could be a result of our such blanket treatment of the patients, using  general dosages of medicine. Those who have been to homeopathic practitioners would appreciate that the Homeo docs. would normally take recourse  to such personalized treatments ( by asking many personal questions, before prescribing any medicine) and hence leading to less side effects and finding a more holistic cure of the disease.  

Your effort through this project I feel will be in this direction towards a more personalized treatment, and will surely be very much successful, as it would be more in line with our nature, that says, each one of us is a unique being with unique problems.

My best wishes for your work, and would love to remain connected on this in the future.

Regards,

Arnab Sen]]></description>
