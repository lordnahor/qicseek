</FONT></FONT>Short of letting you actually taste our food, it's hard to
convey the appeal of our menu offerings - let alone the style of their
presentation. For more casual affairs, Buffalo Cafe features a variety
of continental buffet breakfast, and buffet and boxlunch options. And our more traditional meals let you mix and match
from the broad palette of appetizers, natural array of vegetables, roots,
fruits, berries, nuts dishes, sauces, and salads, soups, entrees, and desserts
that you'll find on our full service. In addition, if you require setup, service, and cleanup, we can supply
the works - plates, utensils, and highly trained servers.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">Who We Are</FONT>
</FONT><BR>
A success since the early 1900's when the Relocation of Indian Tribes
were put on Reservation Camps. The Indian Taco came about when the troops
gave the indians provisions as part of the treaty agreements. Buffalo Cafe
is the brainchild of a native american couple -
<A HREF="resume.html">Cheryl Blackhawk</A> 
-who both met at a non-profit federally funded Native American program
and enjoyed setting Indian Taco booths to help raise funds for the program.
Many people all over the nation who has been to a Native American event
and tasted the Taco always comes back for more. The urge to eat hot, tasty
fry bread stays with them until the next event. In 1996, continued food
booths at fairs, powwow, and native american cultural presentations and
discussions about their interests and about life goals reunited the two,
who determined to create a catering company that went well beyond the ordinary.
The final touch that allowed their goal to become a reality was provided
by a chance encounter with an investor who enjoyed the food and wanted
place with service to share with his friends, family and colleagues this
same Native American Palate Experience he enjoyed. This silent partner
- fresh out of MBA school, dreaming of a business that she could back wholeheartedly,
and still enchanted by his Native American Experience of the same foods
by the Buffalo Cafe.</P>
