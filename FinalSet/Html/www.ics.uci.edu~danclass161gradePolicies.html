<H2> Grading Policies</H2>

<UL>
<LI> Grades are awarded (also with <tt>+</tt> or <tt>-</tt>) as follows:
  <pre>
  A  = excellent
  B  = good
  C  = fair, a solid pass
  D  = poor, just barely passing
  F  = failing, does not meet minimum standards</pre>
<LI> There are no predefined percentage cut-offs for the various grades.
    <BR>
     The translation of percentages to letter grades will be tailored
     depending on the difficulty of the exam,
    <BR>
     but not a function of the class performance on the exam.
    <P>
<LI> There is not a predefined fraction of the class that will
     get any particular grade on any exam or overall.
    <BR>
     The law of large numbers often applies, and the class average
     tends to be between C and B, but cohorts do vary in performance.
