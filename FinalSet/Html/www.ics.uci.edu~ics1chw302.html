<LI><A NAME="QQ1"><B>What kind of services exist on the web that offer 
daily news services?</B>
There are many servers that
currently offer news services.  For instance, the <A 
HREF="http://sfgate.com/new/schron/article-list.cgi?News:mn:today"><B> 
San Francisco Chronicle</B></A> offers a daily news service.  In addition, 
there are also sports services such as <A
HREF="http://www.starwave.com/SatchelSports.html"><B>Satchel Sports</B></A>
that provide daily sports 
updates.  For those 
who wish to have up to 
date weather reports, 
there are a couple of 
<A HREF="http://akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo/News/Daily/Weather/"><B> 
weather services</B></A> availabe through the web as well. Web users 
interested in keeping tabs on tinseltown can access the <A HREF=" 
http://metaverse.com/vibe/sleaze/index.shtml"><B>Cyber Sleaze</B></A> 
report available on the web.  These services represent just a few of the 
many available for those web users interested in current up to date 
accounts of the world around them.

<LI><A NAME="QQ2"><B>Is there a service on the web that allows me to access a database including motion pictures? </B></A><br>
Actually, there is a very comprehensive service available through the web 
that provides detailed information about thousands of motion pictures.  
Not only does this <A HREF="http://www.msstate.edu/Movies/"><B> movie 
database</B></A> provide access to thousands of titles, but there are 
also more specialized databases available as well.  For example, 
accessing the <A 
HREF="http://www.msstate.edu/Movies/top_40_films.html"><B> top 40 
films,</B></A> as rated by web users, is a helpful way to find some good 
movies.  A summary of <A 
HREF="http://www.msstate.edu/M/on-this-day"><B> Hollywood 
birthdays</B></A> is available to those interested.  This page also 
includes a list of today's anniversaries of Hollywood's deceased stars.

<LI><A NAME="QQ3"><B>How many students are political science majors and how does this compare to the number of english students?</B></A><br>
The majors have very similar enrollments but english has a few more 
students enrolled than political science.  UC Irvine's web service 
provides enrollment statistics for all majors, listed by school.  The 
registrar says that 525 students are enrolled as <A 
HREF="gopher://gopher-server.cwis.uci.edu/00/departments/oas/students/enrl/1994-1995/majors/ss"><B> political science</B></A> students and that 557 students are enrolled as <A HREF="gopher://gopher-server.cwis.uci.edu/00/departments/oas/students/enrl/1994-1995/majors/hum"><B> english</B></A> students.
In addition to 
enrollment statistics, 
the registrar can also 
provide information 
more commonly found in 
the UCI catalogue.  Using the web, information about the <A HREF="
gopher://uniedit.cwis.uci.edu:7026/00/flyers/english"><B> english</B></A> 
major and <A HREF="  
gopher://uniedit.cwis.uci.edu:7026/00/flyers/poli.sci"><B> political 
science</B></A> major is easily available. 

<p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ4"><B>How does enrollment vary between an introduction to law class and an introduction to criminal law class?</B></A><br>
Interestingly 
enough, there seems to be far greater interest in criminal law classes 
than in standard introduction to law classes. The enrollment numbers for 
<A HREF=" 
gopher://ka.reg.uci.edu/00/ro/soc/W95/CRM.LAW/%20J%20%207%20%20"><B> 
criminal law J7</B></A> and<A HREF="
 gopher://ka.reg.uci.edu/00/ro/soc/W95/POL%20SCI/%20%20%2071A%20"><B> 
political science 71A</B></A> reflect this trend.  One theory is that 
high profile cases such as the Menendez murder trial, the Rodney King 
case and the O.J. Simpson murder trial have generated an increased 
interest in areas of study involving criminal law.  With the mass media 
placing such a high priority on criminal law cases, it is no wonder why 
students are enrolling in criminal law classes over general law classes 
by a six to one margin.

<LI><A NAME="QQ5"><B>How do the services of the Department of Justice 
differ from the Federal Bureau of Investigation?</B></A><br>
While both agencies come under the authority of the executive branch, the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation is actually a division of the Department 
of Justice.  When the <A HREF=" 
http://lcweb.loc.gov/global/executive/justice.html"><B> Department of 
Justice</B></A> learns of a criminal or civil wrongdoing, the <A 
HREF="http://naic.nasa.gov/fbi/FBI_homepage.html"><B> Federal Bureau of 
Investigation</B></A> investigates the matter further.  Once a 
prosecutorial decision is made, the Department of Justice assumes 
responsibility for the matter and an attorney is assigned.  Therefore, 
Attorney General Janet Reno technically has authority over the F.B.I. 
However, it is well known that in sensitive issues, the Director of the 
F.B.I. reports directly to the <A 
HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov/White_House/Family/images/raw/bill-sax.gif"><B>President of 
the United States.</B></A>
