<td width ="80%">
This programming assignment is designed to ensure that you know how to
  implement two templated classes (<b>Priority Queue</b> and <b>Map</b>)
  binary trees (max-heap and BST respectively).
Your implementations will also include fully-functional iterators for
  these classes.
For the priority queue you will be writing of code that process the underlying
   array storing the values as a max-heap.
For the map you will be writing iterative and recursive code that process the
  BST.
<p>
You can test these implementations by using the standard drivers (provided
  with the download) and GoogleTests that we will use when grading your
  code for correctness; recall that you can augment the GoogleTest with whatever
  code you want, to aid your debugging: a GoogleTest is just a C++ program.
You can also test the code you wrote for Programming Assignment #1 (using
  array implementations of these classes) by substituting these binary tree
  implementations -typically by changing a few <b>typedef</b> statements.
<p>
Write and use the standard <b>insertion</b> (<b>&lt;&lt;</b>) operator and
  <b>str()</b> method in each class for debugging.
For <b>str</b> in <b>HeapPriorityQueue</b> return in a <b>std::string</b> the
  entire contents array for all indexes (ascending) along with the other
  instance variables: from this information you can easily reconstruct the
  max-heap-as-binary_tree.
For <b>str</b> in <b>BSTMap</b> return a <b>std::string</b> that shows the BST
  rotated left by 90 degrees  along with the other instance variables, so you
  can easily examine the structure of the BST.
Note that there is no tested requirement for what these methods return, but
  the versions above will make debugging easier.
<p>
You should download the 
  <a href="program3.zip">program3</a> project folder and use it to create an
  Eclipse project (ultimately needing to connect it to both the
  <b>courselib</b> and <b>googletest</b> libraries).
You will write the required methods in the <b>heap_priority_queue.hpp</b> and
  <b>bst_map.hpp</b>, files in this project, and submit each separately in
  Checkmate.
The project folder also contains two pairs of <b>.hpp</b> and <b>.cpp</b>
  files: a driver/GoogleTest pair for each class that you will write, and the
  <b>driver.cpp</b> file which has a <b>main</b> function that can be made to
  run any of the three drivers.
<p>
Instead, you can also use a existing/working project folder that already is
 connected to both the <b>courselib</b> and <b>googletest</b> libraries: remove
  (but save) all the files in its <b>src</b> folder and then put all the
  <b>.hpp</b> and <b>.cpp</b> files from the downloaded project's <b>src</b>
  folder into the existing/working project's <b>src</b> folder.
<p>
<b>Important: Only one of the <b>.cpp</b> files with a <b>main</b> method can
  be active/compiling at any time.</b>
In the download, only the <b>driver.cpp</b> file is active; the GoogleTests are
  inactive.
To make a progam inactive, select it (in the editor tab), use the <b>Ctrl/a</b>
  command to select all its lines, and then click <b>Source</b> at the top
  left of the menu and choose <b>Toggle Comment</b>: ever line will now appear
  in a comment (so the <b>main</b> function is commented-out; by using these
  same instructions, you can toggle back those lines to not have comments.
<p>
I recommend that you work on this assignment in pairs, with someone in your lab
  section.
Try to find someone who lives near you, with similar programming skills,
  and work habits/schedule: e.g., talk about whether you prefer to work
  mornings, nights, or weekends; what kind of commitment you will make to submit
  program early.
<p>
<b>Only one student should submit all parts of the the assignment</b>, but both
  student's names should appear in the comments at the top of
  <b>each submitted .py</b> file.
It should look something like
<pre><b>
# Romeo Montague, Lab 1
# Juliet Capulet, Lab 1
# We certify that we worked cooperatively on this programming
#   assignment, according to the rules for pair programming</b></pre>
If you do not know what the terms <b>cooperatively</b> and/or
  <b>rules for pair programming</b> mean, please read about
  <a href="../../../common/handouts/pairprogramming.html">Pair Programming</a> 
  before starting this assignment.
Please turn in each program <b>as you finish it</b>, so that I can accurately
  assess the progress of the class as a whole during this assignment.
<p>
Print this document and carefully read it, marking any parts that contain
  important detailed information that you find (for review before you turn in
  the files).
<p>
<p>
This assignment has 2 parts: pairs should work on each part together, not split
  them up and do them separately.
Part 1 is worth 30 points; part 2 is worth 50 points.
Remember I'm going to be running MOSS on the parts of this assignment.
<p>
IMPORTANT: The courselib contains array implementations for all these data
  types (and you have written linked-list versions of them); although this
  assignment requires you to use binary trees, there are still
  <b>many strong similarities</b> at a high level in all these implementations.
So, I encourage you to examine these implementations closely, and understand
  them; possibly, experiment with them (using their drivers or GoogleTests),
  while you are writing your binary tree implementations: this advice is
  especially true as you begin to study, understand, and implement iterators.
Please feel free about asking questions about these methods: both their syntax
  and semantics.

<td width ="20%"><b>Priority Queues</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
Priority Queues can be implemented by a variety of data structures (where the
  highest priority value is always removed first).
How does a specific priority queue determine which value has the highest
  priority?
When constructed, we supply the priority queue with a <b>gt</b> (greater-than)
  function that computes whether its first argument has a greater priority
  than its second argument.
So, we cannot ask, "What is the priority of a value." But, we can ask "Which
  of two values has the higher priority", using the a <b>gt</b> function.
For example, we cannot ask for the priority of a <b>std::string</b> value, but
  we can ask which of two <b>std::string</b> values has the higher priority.
<p>
We can implement priority queues efficiently using a max-heap (stored in an
  array), whose <b>enqueue</b> and <b>dequeue</b> operations are each O(Log N).
When writing the copy constructor and operator=, use the fact that "array
  being copied are already a max-heap" to make these operations O(N) not
  O(N Log N).
When writing the iterator constructor, load the array sequentially with the
  values produced by the iterator, then construct the max-heap in O(N) using the
  offline algorithm discussed in the notes.
<p>
The file <b>heap_priority_queue.hpp</b> declares the appropriate constructors,
  methods, and instance variables.
Note the simple helper methods <b>left_child</b>, <b>right_child</b>, 
  <b>parent</b>, <b>is_root</b>, and <b>in_heap</b>, which abstract the
  mapping functions and two useful <b>bool</b> functions:.
Use these methods to simplify writing the helper methods <b>percolate_up</b> and
  <b>percolate_down (int i)</b>, which do most of the work in the <b>enqueue</b>
  and <b>dequeue</b> methods (respectively) and may be called in other places
  (the iterator's <b>erase</b> method).
Think <b>carefully</b> about how to write these percolate methods simply (or you
  will never get them properly debugged): my method bodies used <b>for</b> loops
  and were 3 lines and 8 lines long each (eachu using <b>std::swap</b>
  included from <b>&lt;utility&gt;</b>.
<p>
I suggest copying/pasting the methods from the <b>array_priority_queue.hpp</b>
  file, and then translating these methods from using an array to using a
  max-heap, since both fundamentally process arrays (e.g., see/call the
  <b>ensure_length</b> helper method).
Pay close attention to ensure <b>all instance variables</b> receive values in
  the constructors and are used/set correctly in queries and commands.
<p>
<b>Iterators:</b>
There is no simple/efficient way to write an iterator for this max-heap
  implementation of priority queues, because the iterator is supposed to
  produce its values from highest to lowest priority, but the array is a
  max-heap (so we cannot just traverse its values); being able to <b>erase</b>
  values with an iterator makes this task even harder.
Here is how to implement the iterator for this class.
<ul>
<li>Notice the <b>ics::HeapPriorityQueue<T> it;</b> instance variable in the
      <b>Iterator</b> class in the <b>HeapPriorityQueue</b> class.
<p>
<li>In the constructor for <b>Iterator</b>, the second argument should be
      <b>true</b> when called from <b>begin</b> and <b>abegin</b> but
      <b>false</b> when called from <b>end</b> and <b>aend</b>.
<p>
<li>When it is <b>true</b> the <b>Iterator</b> should copy the
      <b>ref_pq HeapPriorityQueue</b> into the instance variabler <b>it</b>
      and use this copy for iteration purposes (when <b>false</b> it should 
      leave <b>it</b> empty: its <b>gt</b> can be <b>nullptr</b> because it
      won't be used): examining the the current iterator value calls
      <b>peek()</b> on </b>it</b>; advancing the iterator calls <b>dequeue</b>.
    Overall, the "cursor" is the highest priority value in the <b>it</b>
      priority queue (the one that can be peeked and dequeued).
<p>
<li>To <b>erase</b> a the iterator's "cursor" use the following algorithm:
    <ol>
       <li>Scan the max-heap in the real (<b>ref_pq</b>) priority queue to find
             the index of the value to erase.
       <li>Use that index like the root in the <b>dequeue</b> algorithm with one
             difference: the value put there from the end of the max-heap might
             have to be percolated up instead of down.
           Look at the <b>iterator_erase_heap_special_case</b> GoogleTest to
             see an example of a max-heap (construct its array), where removing
             a value (<b>"f"</b>) causes the value to percolate up.
    </ol>
</ul>
This approach makes the iterators easy to write but expensive in time and space
  to use (especially erase): e.g., storing the second heap requires O(N) extra
   space; creating the iterator requires O(N); <b>++</b> is O(Log N) not O(1):
   erase can be O(N) since it scans the array representing the heap.
<p>
Feel free to question/discuss iterators for <b>HeapPriorityQueue</b> on the
  message boards, so long as no code is posted or described in too much detail.

<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%"><b>Maps</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
Map can be implemented by a variety of data structures: they all associate
  unique keys with values, by storing an <b>ics::pair</b> holding both the
  key and its value.
The data structure should allow us quickly to find the value associated with
  a key, and possibly change/update such a value.
<p>
We can implement maps efficiently by using a binary search tree (BST) whose
  order property is determined by comparing only the key (<b>first</b>) part
  of the <b>pair</b>.
Most operations updating BSTs are O(height of BST) which for non-pathological
  BSTs is O(Log N).
When writing the copy constructor and operator=, use the fact that "the BST
  being copied is already a tree with the correct order property" to make these
  operations O(N) not O(N Log N).
<p>
The file <b>bst_map.hpp</b> declares the appropriate constructors, methods, and
  instance variables.
Note the many helper methods that operate on BSTs: some can be implemented
  more simply iteratively, some more simply recursively.
Many of the standard <b>map</b> methods call one of these helper methods to
  retrieve information from a BST or change it (e.g., add/remove key->value 
  assocations).
These include: <b>find_key</b>, <b>find_value</b>, <b>insert</b>,
  <b>remove_closest</b>, <b>remove</b>, <b>copy</b>, <b>copy_to_queue</b>,
  <b>delete_BST</b> (for destructors),
  <b>equals</b> (a helper for <b>operator == </b>), and 
  <b>print</b> (a helper for <b>str()</b>).
These methods typically are passed the root of a BST (using some parameter
  mode), and if they call themselves recursively recur on a left and/or right
  subtree (passing their left/right child as the root of a smaller tree).
<p>
I have written boilerplate for all these methods.
I suggest examining code in the <b>array_map.hpp</b> file to help you understand
  some of the bookkeeping requirements of these methods.
Many of the recursive helper functions you need to write have similar functions
  in the notes on processing binary trees (including BSTs) recursively.
Pay close attention to ensure <b>all instance variables</b> receive values in
  the constructors and are used/set correctly in queries and commands.
<p>
<b>Iterators:</b>
There is no simple/efficient way to write an iterator for this BST
  implementation of maps, even though there is no requirement for the order
  in which the iterator produces values; being able to <b>erase</b> values with
  an iterator makes this task even harder.
Note that map iterators produce <b>Entry</b> which is defined by 
  <b>typedef ics::pair&lt;KEY,T&gt; Entry;</b>
Here is how to implement the iterator for this class: it has similarities to
  implementing iterators for the heap priority queue.
<ul>
<li>Notice the <b>ics::ArrayQueue<T> it;</b> instance variable in the
      <b>Iterator</b> class in the <b>BSTMap</b> class.
<p>
<li>In the constructor for <b>Iterator</b>, the second argument should be
      <b>true</b> when called from <b>begin</b> and <b>abegin</b> but
      <b>false</b> when called from <b>end</b> and <b>aend</b>.
<p>
<li>When it is <b>true</b> the <b>Iterator</b> fills the <b>it</b> queue with
      every key->value pair in the BST storing the map and use this queue for
      iteration purposes (when <b>false</b> it should leave <b>it</b> empty):
      examining the current iterator value calls <b>peek()</b> on
      </b>it</b>; advancing the iterator calls <b>dequeue</b>.
    Overall, the "cursor" is the front key->value pair in the <b>it</b>
      queue (the one that can be peeked and dequeued).
<p>
<li>To <b>erase</b> a the iterator's "cursor" remove its key->value pair from
      the BST storing the map.
</ul>
This approach makes the iterators easy to write but expensive in time to
  create (copying all the key->value pairs from the BST to the queue is O(N))
  and space (storing each key->pair value in the BST and in the queue requires
  O(N) extra space).
<p>
Feel free to question/discuss iterators for <b>BSTMap</b> on the
  message boards, so long as no code is posted or described in too much detail.

<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%"><b>Testing</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
There are various ways to test each of the classes you are writing in this
  programming assignment.
First, though, you should write all the methods, paying careful attention to
  the array implementations and previously written linked list implementations.
For some, you might just boiler-plate simple code that is not correct, but
  allows the methods to compile, allowing other methods in the classes to be
  tested.
<p>
The easiest way to start testing//debugging is by using the driver program.
It allows you to perform any method call supported by the templated classes,
  and see the state of the class (or view the debugger).
Of course, 
<b>you must get the <b>insertion</b> (&lt;&lt;) operator and str() method to
  work before using it to debug the other methods.</b>
<p>
After you debug your code with the driver, try running the appropriate
  GoogleTest code.
Again, this form of testing is useful only as you approach a finished solution.
We will use the GoogleTest, and visual inspection, to grade this
  assignment.
<b>Important Note</b>: You can put <b>std::cout</b> statements in the GoogleTest
  code (but don't accidentally remove any of the assertions, otherwise
  you won't be fully checking your code the way we will) while you are
  debugging your classes.
All debugging <b>std::cout</b> should end in <b>std::endl</b> to flush the
  output stream: ensure the output it displayed before executing the next
  statement
<p>
When you run the GoogleTest, choose small values for the first and
  third prompts (just press return to the second prompt) or replace these
  prompts with small values.
Besides an indication of which tests pass and fail, the console window
  will show a speed for the speed test (which will vary depending on how
  fast a machine you run your code on): don't worry about it.
When your code is passing all the tests, put in values like 10,000 for these
  prompts.
