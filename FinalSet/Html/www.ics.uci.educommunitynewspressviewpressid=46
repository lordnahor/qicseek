 <strong>May 9,  2006</strong><p><strong>Nine UCI undergraduates win prestigious scholarships</strong><p><i>Arthur Uy Asuncion Jr., Bren School of ICS senior, awarded an NSF Graduate Fellowship</i><p>Nine UC Irvine undergraduates have earned prestigious national scholarships during this academic year. These exceptional students represent a variety of academic and public-service interests: from advocating for affordable housing to developing the next generation of medical imaging technology.<p>This year's awards include two Fulbright Fellowships, two Barry M. Goldwater Scholarships, a Harry S. Truman Scholarship, a Merage American Dream Fellowship, a Donald A. Strauss Scholarship and a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. A USA Today All-USA College Academic First Team winner from UCI previously was announced.<p>"We congratulate these exemplary students and are excited by their bright futures," said Sharon Salinger, dean of UCI&rsquo;s Division of Undergraduate Education. "The wide range of interests represented by these scholarship winners highlights the diverse intellectual environment UCI offers its undergraduates."<p><b>National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship: Arthur Uy Asuncion Jr.</b><p>The National Science Foundation&rsquo;s Graduate Research Fellowship Program recognizes and supports outstanding graduate students in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics. The fellowship provides support for three years of graduate study. Fellows are expected contribute significantly to research, teaching and innovations in science and engineering.<p><b>Arthur Uy Asuncion Jr.</b>, a senior studying information and computer science, won the NSF Graduate Fellowship and will return to UCI for his graduate research combining artificial intelligence and distributed computing. Last year, Asuncion earned the Goldwater scholarship for his computer science work, and he maintains a perfect 4.0 GPA. The seventh UCI student to win the NSF fellowship, he is from Cypress, Calif.<p><b>Harry S. Truman Scholarship: Mukul Kumar</b><p>The Harry S. Truman Scholarship is considered the nation&rsquo;s most prestigious award for college juniors who have demonstrated exceptional leadership potential and are committed to careers in public service. This year, 75 students from 63 colleges received the award. The Truman Scholarship Foundation was established by Congress in 1975 as the federal memorial to President Harry S. Truman.<p><b>Mukul Kumar</b>, a junior history major, is one of just two California students to receive the Truman scholarship this year. Kumar is dedicated to expanding affordable housing. To help combat obstacles low-income families face in obtaining housing, Kumar has interned with the Fair Housing Council of Orange County, where he helped resolve landlord-tenant disputes as a licensed mediator. As an student, Mukul conducted research on Santa Ana&rsquo;s housing laws and wrote a paper that earned him the Chancellor&rsquo;s Award for Undergraduate Research. He is currently in Delhi taking graduate level coursework on a Rotary Ambassadorial Scholarship. A junior fellow of the American Academy of Political Science, Kumar is researching how slum communities in India interact with political parties and the state. Kumar is the sixth Truman scholarship recipient from UCI, the most recent being won in 2004. Kumar is a resident of Irvine.<p><b>U.S. Fulbright Scholarship: Marika Csapo and Vanessa Zuabi</b><p>The U.S. Fulbright Scholarship was established by Congress in 1946 to foster mutual understanding among nations and is the premier U.S. government scholarship program allowing graduate students and professors to study abroad. Since its inception, more than 250,000 individuals around the world, chosen for their leadership potential, have participated in the program.<p>* <b>Marika Csapo</b>, a senior double majoring in dance and political science, will use her Fulbright scholarship to study political science in Uruguay, examining how housing policies effect Uruguay&rsquo;s urban poor. She will work alongside international experts at the Research Program on Integration, Poverty and Social Exclusion at the Universidad Cat�lica del Uruguay.<p>* <b>Vanessa Zuabi</b>, a senior double majoring in international studies and political science, will study comparative politics in France. Zuabi will research the French colonial influence on legal and civil society of Lebanon and have access to the Center of Overseas Archives, Europe&rsquo;s largest archive on the continent&rsquo;s colonial history. She plans to work with Michel Camau, professor of political science at the Institut d&rsquo;Etudes Politiques d&rsquo;Aix en Provence and director of a research center on Arab and Muslim issues. Zuabi is from Laguna Niguel, Calif.<p><b>Merage American Dream Fellowship: Vilma Palma</b><p>The Merage American Dream Fellowship was established in 2004 and is dedicated to promoting expanded education and career opportunities for immigrants. Students are chosen for their strong desire and real capacity to achieve leadership roles in business, science, education, public service, culture and the arts. Recipients receive $20,000 to pursue their vision.<p><b>Vilma Palma</b>, a senior in criminology, law and society, is the third UCI student to win a Merage American Dream Fellowship. Born in El Savador, Palma is the first in her family to attend college and as a student has consistently lent her hand to others. She mentors through the School of Social Ecology&rsquo;s mentoring program and has served as a residential assistant for COSMOS, a summer math and science program for California high school students.
