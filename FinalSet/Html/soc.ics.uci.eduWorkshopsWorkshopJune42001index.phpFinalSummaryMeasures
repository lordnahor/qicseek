      <p>Summary Prepared by Matthew Bietz, Darren Gergle, 
              and Gary Olson</p>
      <p>The first question we addressed in the workshop 
              was: How would one judge a collaboration or a collaboratory to be 
              successful? While we were unable to develop a universal measure 
              of success for collaboratories, we were able to make progress on 
              developing a framework for measuring the success of collaboratories, 
              eliciting a number of possible measures of success, and pinpointing 
              open issues and problems. </p>
      <p class="subhead">Framework </p>
      <p>We proposed a 3-dimensional framework for 
              thinking about measurement of collaboratories:  </p>
      <p class="subhead">Dimension 1:Stakeholders</p>
      <ul>
        <li>technologists </li>
        <li>domain</li>
        <li>userssocial </li>
        <li>scientists</li>
        <li>sponsors/funders</li>
        <li>corporations</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subhead">Dimension 2: Level of analysis </p>
      <ul>
        <li>individuals</li>
        <li>groups</li>
        <li>organizations</li>
        <li>fields</li>
        <li>social policy</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subhead"> Dimension 3:Time </p>
      <p>short-term vs. long-term 
              measures of success</p>
      <p>The measures used to 
              gauge success will vary on each of these three axes: </p>
      <p>A social scientist may 
              consider a collaboratory successful because it produced new knowledge 
              about how people work, even if it did not advance the domain.</p>
      <p>Similarly, a collaboratory 
              that leads to successful organizational outcomes may have a negative 
              impact on some individual careers.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>The third dimension, 
              time, takes into account that second-order effects may be slower 
              to appear.</p>
      <p>A proposed dimension for the framework involved 
              a focus on the collaboratory as a socio-technical system or on the 
              collaboration process itself.&nbsp; In retrospect, this distinction 
              seems to overlap with the other dimensions.&nbsp; We will probably 
              focus more on socio-technical environment when looking at longer 
              time spans and larger levels of analysis.&nbsp; Shorter time spans 
              and individual levels of analysis lead to a focus on the micro-processes 
              of collaboration. </p>
      <p>Domain sits as a layer on top of this framework.&nbsp; 
              The measures of success may not be the same for AIDS researchers 
              and physicists.&nbsp; In addition, the definition of the axes may 
              be altered based on various domains.&nbsp; Some fields may have 
              a relatively homogeneous set of users, while others may have many 
              different sub-categories with different success criteria.&nbsp; 
              The time dimension may differ among domains, for example, on the 
              length of time for a study to reach publication.<br>

      <p class="subhead">Open Issues</p>
      <p class="subhead">Measurement issues</p>
      <p>How can we know what to measure from the start 
              (e.g., good baseline information)? </p>
      <p>How do we integrate qualitative and quantitative 
            data? When are each appropriate? 
      </p> 
      <p>How do we measure secondary effects? </p> 
      <p>How does the evolution of the collaboratory 
            affect which measures are appropriate and when? </p> 
      <p>Measures will be different based on the kind 
            of collaboratory, is there a way to integrate? </p> 
      <p>How do we deal with the effects of time on 
            measures of success </p> 
      <p>Lag in the results of increases for things 
            like citations. </p> 
      <p>Each collaboratory may progress at a different 
            timescale and level of granularity </p> 
      <p>How do you deal with successful uses of the 
            collaboratory that remain invisible. </p> 
      <p>E.g., Traditional success measures not always 
            useful in determining the success of the collaboratory (e.g., successful 
            collaboration, but the hypothesis under investigation fails) </p> 
      <p>Are different measures needed to differentiate 
            productivity at the levels of the individuals, groups and within the 
            entire community or larger culture as a whole? </p> 
      <p>How can less ambitious results and goals be 
            used in the measurement of success? </p> 
      <p class="subhead">Utility of measures</p>
      <p>Are these measures always indicative of good 
              things? </p>
      <p>Are the measures of success truly indicative 
            of scientific advancement?) </p> 
      <p class="subhead">Larger questions</p>
      <p>Is multi-disciplinary work better for science 
            overall?  
      <p>Do collaboratories have better research coming 
            out because people can share and test hypotheses? Basis of design makes communication and results faster and 
            easier. </p> 
      <p>Is 'faster and cheaper' better? </p> 
      <p>Can new ideas be quelled early on due to wider 
            exposure garnered from collaboratories? </p> 
      <p>Is there a lost efficiency in collaborations 
            due to the duplication of effort, requirements to learn new terminology, 
            or new interaction patterns? </p> 
      <p>Ortega hypotheses. Science moves by key papers 
            and do collaboratories support this or just more widespread and lower 
            quality results? </p> 
      <p>How do you use anecdotal evidence effectively? 
            (e.g., to nurture funding) </p> 
      <p>A distinction needs to be made between the 
      <i>process</i> of doing science and the <i>productivity</i>
            of science. There may be important and interesting 
            changes that occur in the process that traditional measures do not 
            capture.</p>
      <p>What are collaboratories? </p> 
      <p>&quot;Technology-mediated scientific collaboration 
            at a distance.&quot; </p> 
      <p>A place where people can discuss common terms 
            and ideas. </p> 
      <p>People are brought together (either physically 
            or virtually) to solve common problems.</p> 
      <p>Solving distance issues and a place where 
            participants can share ideas more often.</p> 
      <p>Often involves people who don't know each 
            other personally, but are in the same field. </p> 
      <p>May form a virtual proximity. </p> 
      <p>A certain level of interaction is facilitated 
            between or among individuals or groups. </p> 
      <p>Provides way for detection and resolution 
            of central and peripheral problems. </p> 
      <p><p class="subhead">What 
              is collaboration?</p>
      <p>Is a citation a collaboration? (e.g., putting 
              things into database) </p>
      <p>Is there a requirement of interaction for 
            collaboration? </p> 
      <p>Can you have chains of interaction to form 
            collaboration? </p> 
      <p>Allows individuals to have collaboration without 
            common knowledge of the collaboration </p> 
      <p>E.g., Genbank has a community and model of 
            the way things get done, and can this then be collaborative </p> 
      <p><p class="subhead">Necessary conditions for a collaboratory</p>
      <p>Whether collaboratory activity and success could 
              include individual work done within the collaboratory. </p>
      <p>How to articulate the necessary social environment 
            for a collaboratory. </p> 
      <p>Whether such things as supercomputing facilities 
            could be considered </p> 
      <p>What kind of distances must collaboratories 
            span (geographic, functional, and institutional)? </p> 
      <p>Tension between collaboratory use as the enabler 
            of collaborations vs. the use of facilities designed to enable collaboration. 
      </p> 
      <p><p class="subhead">Suggestions for what isn't a collaboratory</p>
      <p>Not doing anything new. </p>
      <p>No attempt to create synergy. </p> 
      <p>Not bringing new people into contact with 
            one another. </p> 
      <p>Might be an actual collaboration using Finholt's 
            demonstration of German use of tele-pointers and interaction in a 
            collaboration to discuss and have mutually constructed understanding. 
      </p> 
      <p>Canned presentation without support for collaboration 
            of people (perhaps just a presentation). </p> 
      <p>E.g., a virtual seminar may be more towards 
            a collaboration than others. </p> 
      <p>Broadcast types of interactions (e.g., lectures 
            in distance learning). </p> 
      <p>However, it doesn't provide a means for return 
            interaction. </p> 
      <p><p class="subhead">Next Steps </p></p>
      <p>As an overall goal, we need to develop theory 
            around collaborations and collaboratories with technology &#8211; 
            make a jump from explaining what goes on in collaboratories to theorizing 
            why it happens. As part of this, we envision four documents: 
       
      <ol>
        <li>Stock-taking: document what we know, inventory 
                of criteria of success, etc</li>
            <p class="listdesc">what do we know works</p>
            <p class="listdesc">run it on existing collaboratories to see 
                    if they are matching the criteria (to check inventory and 
                    to tell something about collaboratories) </p>
            <p class="listdesc">possibly include known best practices</p>
        <li>Document on what data we need to collect 
                and how to collect it (and where): more focuses on prospective 
                piece</li>

                    sample size and get same measures </p>

                    about what they wish they'd asked in previous surveys but 
                    did not </p>

                    would not occur without the collaboratory, we don't have a
