Patterson Content based on the SIGIR2009 paper located here: http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1571941.1572030  When more is less: the paradox of choice in search engine use  When more is less: the paradox of choice in search engine use In studies of consumer goods Large amounts of choice can lead to user “paralysis” poor choices dissatisfaction (despite good choices)  Watterson, B. (1996). It's a magical world.
