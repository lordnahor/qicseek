	<TD><FONT SIZE=3><STRONG>The name Otoe (OH-toe) was historically derived from Wat'odatan (wat-OH-dah-tah)&quot;
          The story is about an otoe man and woman;they wanted to copulate&quot;, a <BR>story joke given to them by 
	    related Missouri and Ioway.
  <TR>
	<TD>They lived near the Iowa during early history between 1690 � 1700.  The Oto, the Missouri, the Ooway, and 
	    Winnebago showed up in the prehistoric record as the Oneota culture. The Oto  lived near the Iowa during both 
	    tribes earliest histories, the Oto being especially connected to the Blue Earth and <BR>southwestern Iowa. 
	    After leaving Iowa by the 1750�s traveling along the Arkansas River and later crossing the Missouri River to
	    Nebraska.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
	<TD>The Missouri lived along the stretch of the Missouri from its junction with  their Mississippi to Southwestern 
	    Iowa.  The French explorers named them. After the wars between the Sauk and Mesquakies during 1798, much 
	    of their land and diminished resources led them to almost distinction,  The members that were left disbanded 
          and sought refuge among the Oto.</TD></TR>
<TR>
	<TD>Living in villages along the Platte River, the Otoe and Missouri still retained their hunting rights in 
	    Western Iowa. After ceding their lands in Nebraska in 1854, the Oto and Missouri were assigned the Big Blue 
          River Reservation (Big Blue) on the Kansas and Nebraska border.  During that period of 1880 the Indian Agency allowed the white farmers to buy the lands without the Oto-Missouria' permission.  With the help of a few good <BR>
          men from the Department of Interior, a small part of the money for that land was given back.  With this they bought their
          own reservation in Oklahoma which was subsequently allotted; most of this land passing out of their hands.
          Now classified as one tribe , they are called the Otoe-Missouria of Oklahoma, near Red Rock, Oklahoma.</BR></TD></TR>
