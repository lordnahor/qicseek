<center><h2>18th ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on <br> 
Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming (PPoPP 2013)<br> 
23-27 February 2013, Shenzhen, China </h2></center> 
 
<center><h2>Call for Papers</h2></center> 
 
<p>
PPoPP is a forum for leading work on all aspects of parallel programming, including 
foundational and theoretical aspects, techniques, languages, compilers, runtime 
systems, tools, and practical experiences. In the context of the symposium, "parallel 
programming" encompasses work on concurrent and parallel systems (multicore, 
multithreaded, heterogeneous, clustered systems, distributed systems, grids, clouds, 
and large scale machines). Given the rise of parallel architectures into the consumer 
market (desktops, laptops, and mobile devices), PPoPP is particularly interested in 
work that addresses new parallel workloads, techniques, and tools that attempt to 
improve the productivity of parallel programming, and work towards improved synergy 
with such emerging architectures.  Specific topics of interest include (but are not 
limited to):
<UL>
  <li> Parallel programming theory and models
  <li> Formal analysis and verification
  <li> Parallel programming languages
  <li> Compilers and runtime systems
  <li> Task-parallel libraries
  <li> Parallel application frameworks
  <li> Software productivity for parallel programming
  <li> Middleware for parallel systems
  <li> Performance analysis, debugging and optimization
  <li> Development, analysis, or management tools
  <li> Parallel algorithms
  <li> Parallel applications
  <li> Concurrent data structures
  <li> Synchronization and concurrency control
  <li> Software engineering for parallel programs
  <li> Fault tolerance for parallel systems
  <li> Software for heterogeneous architectures
  <li> Programming tools for parallel and heterogeneous systems
  <li> Parallelism in non-scientific workloads: web servers, search, analytics
</UL>

<p>
Papers should report on original research relevant to parallel
programming, and should contain enough background materials to make
them accessible to the entire parallel programming research community.

<p>
Papers describing experiences should indicate how they illustrate
general principles; papers about parallel programming foundations
should indicate how they relate to practice.  Poster submissions
should meet similar criteria for originality and relevance, but may
present emerging ideas or results that are not yet sufficiently
developed for a full paper.


<p>
All submissions must be made electronically through the conference web
site. Abstracts must include contact information, the full list of
authors and their affiliations, and a description (100-400 words) of
the anticipated content of the paper. Full paper submissions must be
in PDF formatted for US lettersize paper. They must not exceed 10
pages (all inclusive) in standard ACM two-column conference format
(preprint mode, with page number). Templates for ACM format are
available for Microsoft Word, and LaTeX at
<a href="http://www.sigplan.org/authorInformation.htm">
http://www.sigplan.org/authorInformation.htm</a> (use the 9 pt
template). Over-length submissions will be summarily discarded by the
Program Chair. Submissions will be judged on correctness, relevance,
originality, significance, and clarity.

<p>
Paper submission is double-blind to reduce reviewer bias against or
for authors or institutions. Thus, the submissions cannot include
author names, institutions or hints based on references to prior
work. If authors are extending their own work, they need to reference
and discuss the past work in third person, as if they were extending
someone else's research. We realize that for some papers it will still
reveal authorship, but as long as an effort was made to follow these
guidelines, the submission will not be penalized. Authors must
identify any conflicts-of-interest with PC members and external
review committee members, as defined here:
http://www.sigplan.org/review_policies.htm (ACM SIGPLAN policy).

<p>
Poster submissions must conform to the same format restrictions, but
may not exceed 2 pages in length. Paper submissions that are not
accepted for regular presentations will automatically be considered
for posters; authors who do not want their paper considered for the
poster session should indicate this in their abstract
submission. Two-page summaries of posters will be included in the
conference proceedings.

<p>
The proceedings will be published by ACM Press. Authors of accepted
papers and posters will be required to sign the ACM copyright
form. Instructions for preparing papers for the proceedings will be
emailed to authors of accepted papers. Instructions for preparing
papers for the proceedings will be emailed to authors of accepted
papers.
