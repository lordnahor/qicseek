          <li><strong>Goals:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>To practice rapid storyboarding animation for communicating high level use case scenarios to clients. </strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>Using informal animation to illustrate an idea or a concept is a powerful technique that is especially useful in the early prototyping phases of application development. While a commercial tool, such as Adobe Flash and Microsoft PowerPoint, may enable its users to create relatively sophisticated animations, their animation interface can be quite cumbersome for a designer who wishes to quickly sketch out an initial prototype version of an animation.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>To reflect on storyboarding methods and what their relative strengths are. </strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>This  assignment is meant to inspire your creativity, flex your design muscles, <br />
                    and give you a chance share your own designs in class. The assignments are meant to be <br />
                  lightweight and fun. </li>

          <li><strong>Assignment</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>K-Sketch, an open source animation program created by Richard Davis enables novices to easily create informal <br />
  animations from sketches.
    <ul>
      <li>Read the K-Sketch CHI paper available here:<a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1357122"> http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1357122</a> </li>
      </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Watch the 6 demonstration videos available here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=1128A3D949137993">http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=1128A3D949137993</a></li>
              <li>Install a version of K Sketch
                <ul>
                  <li>You will need a Windows PC to use K-Sketch. A tablet PC is ideal. </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Prototype the storyboard for your project using K-Sketch
                <ul>
                  <li>You animation should be between 1 and 4 minutes </li>
                  <li>It should have minimal text</li>
                  <li>It should be understandable by anyone in our class who knows what your project is.</li>
                  <li>Do not worry too much about polishing the &ldquo;look&rdquo; of your sketches, especially if you feel you are not a good &ldquo;artist&rdquo;. Instead focus on conveying the concept through the animation. </li>
                  <li>Export your animation file as a flash file </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Lead a discussion of your idea          </strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Present your group persona:
                <ul>
                  <li>This should be a single slide or image accompanied by a story that you read about the group that you are working with.  It should be specific, not abstract.  It should be a story about their group interaction before you intervene with your design.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Present your animation
                <ul>
                  <li>It should be a .flv file from K-Sketch</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Digital documents can be uploaded to the <a href="https://eee.uci.edu/toolbox/dropbox/index.php?op=openfolder&amp;folder=225743">dropbox</a> or carried in on a flash drive. </li>
              <li> Each person in the audience will fill out an anonymous questionairre like this:
                <ul>
                  <li>How prepared was this group? 1 2 3 4 5</li>
                  <li>Would this group persona  help guide the design process? 1 2 3 4 5
                    <ul>
                      <li> This group persona sounded like a real group? 1 2 3 4 5</li>
                      <li>This group persona was specific (not abstract) ? 1 2 3 4 5 </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>The animation effectively conveyed the concept of the intervention (not a question about artistic ability)? 1 2 3 4 5</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Grading</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>50 points effectiveness of flash animation</li>
              <li>25 points persona </li>
              <li>25 points presentation</li>
              <li>15 bonus points if you create a second story board using a different technology and compare and contrast the two at the end of your presentation. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
