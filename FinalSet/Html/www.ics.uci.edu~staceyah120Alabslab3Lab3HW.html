    You must <span style="text-decoration: underline;">type</span> your
    lab assignments and submit them through the EEE Dropbox tool. A
    dropbox will be set up for each of the four lab assignments. This
    lab assignment is due Wednesday, Nov. 13 by 5pm. You must include
    all relevant R code used to answer the questions.<br>

            <ol>
              <li>Look up the help file for the Hypergeometric
                distribution in R. The Hypergeometric distribution as
                stated in the back of our textbook is defined in terms
                of parameters A, B, and n. R, on the other hand, defines
                the Hypergeometric distribution in terms of parameters
                m, n, and k. Express each parameter from the book (A, B,
                and n) in terms of the parameters used by R (m, n, and
                k).<br>
              </li>
              <li>Recall the scenario from Exercise 8 in Section 3.1 of
                our book (Problem #2 on Homework 4). Define X as the
                number of red balls obtained from a sample of size 20
                with replacement from a certain box where 10 percent of
                the balls are red. Use the built-in probability
                functions in R to calculate the following probabilities:</li>
              <ol type="a">
                <li>P(X = 3)</li>
                <li>P(X &lt;= 3)</li>
                <li>P(X &gt; 3)</li>
                <li>P(X &gt;= 3)<br>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <li>The <b>Central Limit Theorem</b> (Theorem 6.3.1) is a
                famous result that is the basis of a large number of
                statistical methods, and we will prove this theorem in
                Chapter 6. For now, you are going to perform a
                simulation that will demonstrate the results of this
                theorem. Your simulation should do the following:</li>
              <ol type="a">
                <li>Choose a probability distribution from which to
                  generate data. (This can be any of the probability
                  distributions introduced in this lab, but do not
                  choose the normal distribution.)</li>
                <li>Generate 1000 random samples of size <i>n</i> = 5
                  from your chosen distribution (use a for loop!). For
                  each sample, calculate the sample mean (using the
                  "mean" function in R), so in the end, you have a
                  vector of 1000 sample means.</li>
                <li>Create a histogram of the 1000 sample means with a
                  density plot overlaid.</li>
                <li>Repeat parts b. and c. for random samples of size <i>n</i>
                  = 10, <i>n</i> = 25, and <i>n</i> = 100. Write a few
                  sentences describing what happens to the distributions
                  of sample means as the sample size increases -- as <i>n</i>
                  increases, what happens to the shape of the histogram?
                  the spread/variability of the sample means? the
                  center/mean of the sample means?<br>
                </li>
              </ol>
            </ol>
