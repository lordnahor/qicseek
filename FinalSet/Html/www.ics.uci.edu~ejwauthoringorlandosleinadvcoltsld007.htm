The rationale for this requirement was the following scenario:
</UL><UL>
I have a collection that is highly sensitive, and I don�t want its existence to be known.  But I do want to give Tom access to one particular resource in the collection to get his comments on it.  So I create a direct reference to it from another location, but I want to be able to insure that Tom can�t find out about the rest of the stuff in the collection where it resides.</UL> </P>
