<ul>
  <li>Goals: The  purpose of this assignment is:
    <ul>
        <li>to interpret your evaluation fair data</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Instructions
    <ul>
        <li>This is a group project, submit information as a group </li>
      <li>Turn in a report by email to Harmony cc'ing Silvia and Prof. Patterson </li>
      <li>The report should contain
        <ul>
              <li>Your original hand drawn proposals juxtaposed against the final website and mobile design (if applicable)
                <ul>
                    <li>I would like an analysis of why there are differences between the two. That may include: </li>
                  <li>What differences are the result of technological limitations both in the fundamental technology and in your knowledge of how to implement it ? </li>
                  <li>What differences are the result of design choices made after the hand-drawn proposal?</li>
                  <li>What other reasons/ rationale caused a difference?</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
          <li>A presentation of the results collected in the evaluation fair
            <ul>
                    <li>Each test that you performed coupled with the results of the test presented in a way that effectively communicates what you discovered. (graph, selected comments, table, etc.)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>An interpretation of the results from the evaluation fair
            <ul>
                    <li>Why did you get the results you did? Are they surprising? Are they useful? </li>
              <li>Would you pick different evaluation metrics in the future? What would they be? </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>A proposed way forward
            <ul>
                    <li>Given your results and your interpretation, what is an appropriate design response to the website that you have created?</li>
              <li>How would you change the interaction patterns?</li>
              <li>How would you change the functionality?</li>
              <li>What usage patterns would you choose to abandon and what new patterns would you choose to support?</li>
              <li>Would you add new pages to the interaction? Would you add new features? Which ones    ?</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>A technology laundry list
            <ul>
                    <li>What technologies, languages, libraries,  techniques and software did you use to implement your design?</li>
              <li>Where can one find more information on those technologies?</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>A URL
            <ul>
                    <li>A url where your application can be found. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Depending on how you format your report, something that is 5 - 10 pages of double-space text plus additional pages for images is the target length. Competent analysis is more important than length</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
