<p>The XAR system is implemented in Java. The source code under 'src' however needs to be linked with a number of 'jar' files, given that XAR uses (i) GATE and (ii) TuProlog for underlying tokenization and deductive inference capabilities respectively . </p>
<p><em>Software (Prerequsities): </em></p>
<p>You will need to have installed (i) Java JDK (I have used v 1.5.0) and a JRE (I have used v 1.6.0), (ii) GATE, this is the underlying tokenizer and name-entity recognizer used, download GATE (v 3.1, I have not tested with GATE 4.0) from <a href="http://gate.ac.uk">here</a> and install it, (iii) Eclipse, this is just the IDE I used. You should of course be able to compile XAR without Eclipse as well. </p>
<p><em>Environment variables: </em></p>
<p>Set JAVA_HOME should be set to the path of your (Java) JDK.</p>
<p>Include the path to &lt;JRE-ROOT&gt;/lib in your classpath (&lt;JRE-ROOT&gt; is the root directory for your JRE)</p>
<p>Set (the environment variable) gate.home to &lt;GATE-ROOT&gt; (where &lt;GATE-ROOT&gt; is the root directory of where GATE gets installed on your machine) </p>
<p><em>Compilation Steps: (Eclipse) </em></p>
<p>Note: I have succesfully compiled using the above JDK and JRE versions, in Eclipse 3.1 on a Windows XP machine. </p>
<p>0) Create a new (Java) project in the Eclipse environment.</p>
<p>1) Import the files in the src directory (Right click on the new project created in Eclipse, select &quot;import&quot;, and then the src directory.</p>
<p>2) Link to the required jar files. Right click on the package (default) created, select &quot;Build Path&quot;, then &quot;Configure build path&quot;, then under 'Libraries' select &quot;Add external jars&quot; and: </p>
<p>Select gate.jar under &lt;GATE-ROOT&gt;/bin/. Similarly link to 'tools.jar' which should be under your &lt;JDK-ROOT&gt;/bin/. Finally also link to all the jar files in the 'jars' directory provided in the XAR distribution. </p>
<p>The src files should all compile without any errors. The main executable is 'Extractor' which is what you invoke to run XAR. </p>
<p>Note: This application requires a large(r) amount of virtual memory. Set it to -Xmx1024m under 'Arguments' (VM) in the 'Run' window in Eclipse. </p>
<p>Invoking 'Extractor' should bring up the main XAR menu.</p>
<p>NOTE: It is recommended that you first try running some pre-assembled applications provided, and also assemble at least one application on your own with this installation. Then you can integrate in the deeper analyzers as described below. </p>
<p><strong>Additional: StanfordParser Integration</strong></p>
<p>1. Download the StanfordParser source code available here.</p>
<p>2. In the new project that you created for XAR, now also import the file system at /edu/src. </p>
<p>3. In XAR.java do a search for the comment label //LABEL-SNP. Decomment the code at these locations (there are 5 such instances) </p>
<p>That's it. The StanfordParser is integrated in, and you will be able to use it for deep feature extraction. </p>
