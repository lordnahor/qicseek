<p>Research Issues Worthy of Exploration</p>
<p>1) The integrated use of multiple kinds of analysis, features, and features at different semantic levels</p>
<p> - Full natural language parsing vs shallow parsing </p>
<p>2) Combining induced rules and patterns with hand-crafted rules</p>
<p>3) Probabilistic framework for extraction</p>
<p> - Confidence measures for rules and extracted data</p>
<p>4) Specific tasks such as use of coreference analysis</p>
<p>5) Spatial and temporal grounding</p>
<p>6) Limitations of induction based approaches</p>
<p>7) Induction of rules in more expressive languages  </p>
