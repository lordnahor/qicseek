<LI><A NAME="QQ1"><H2>What is X-ray Microscopy?</H2></A>
<a href"http://suntid.bnl.gov:8080/nslsnews/1193/art1.html">X-ray 
microscopy</a> is a new technique of 
using microscopy to help aid in biological research.  It has higher 
resolution than some of the other microscopes (i.e. <a 
href="http://www-i.almaden.ibm.com/vis/stm.html">scanning tunnelling 
microscopes</a>, scanning force microscopes, and scanning near-field optical 
microscopes), and yet do less radiation damage to the specimen.  One 
biological use of the X-ray microscope would be in the study of 
chromosomes, where they can be examined in a wet environment, as opposed 
to being dried in preparation for viewing through the other microscopic 
techniques.
<p>If you happen to be a Beckman Institute or University of Illinois 
researcher, faculty, or visitor, you may be able to have access to such 
microscopes at the <a 
href="http://delphi.beckman.uiuc.edu/access.html">VizLab.</a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ2"><H2>What are these "virtual malls" that I'm 
seeing all over the web?</H2></A> 
While poking around on the WWW, I have found 
numerous "malls" that are arranged quite similarly to the physical 
shopping malls.  <a href="http://virtuamall.com">Virtumall</a> is such an 
example, where it harbors such establishments as <b>The Maples Fruit 
Farm</b>--caters fruit baskets,<b> Five Star Cookie Company, Going 
Greek</b>--a store that sells clothing for campus clubs and organizations, 
and <b>East Coast Brewing Supply.</b>  This mall is even arranged in two  
levels to make room for new shops that want to open up.
<p>Another large virtual multi-mall called<a 
href="http://www.cybermalls.com">  
CyberMalls</a> contains mini malls that are grouped by the type of products 
that they offer.  <a 
href="http://www.cybermalls.com/cywharf/cywhamal.html">CyberWharf</a> 
carries everything from power boats to fishing products to nautical clothing!
<p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ3"><H2>Okay, I have found a shop that accepts "ecash." 
What's that??</H2></A> 
Sometimes when doing business over the 
internet, conventional cash can become difficult to use.  <a 
href="http://www.digicash.com/ecash">Ecash</a> is <b>electronic cash</b> 
that has all the benefits of regular cash, and yet it is safe, fast, and 
allows the buyer to remain anonymous still!  Even though it is still in a 
testing phase, it does seem highly foreseeable in the future that it will 
become common use.  An experimental grocery store, <a href= 
"http://rainer.bnt.com/htbin/wa">Wane's Online Grocery Store,</a> allows 
people to grab a shopping cart and select items off of aisles while a 
running total is kept on the screen.
<p>
Not only can ecash be used to make purchases, it can also be used for 
donations.  <a href="http://www.dds.nl/~tsoc/tsoc.html">The 
Samaritans</a> is one such place.  They are a non-religious charity group 
that offers support for suicidal and dispairing people in the United 
Kingdom.

<LI><A NAME="QQ4"><H2>I want to find out EVERYTHING I can about the 
one and only Sin City...Las Vegas.  What's the quickest way?</H2></A> 
Well, you can find out practically everything you want to know about the  
Glittering City by accessing <a href="http://www.infi.net/vegas/online">Las
Vegas Online.</a>  Here, you can gather information about <a 
href="http://www.infi.net/vegas/KLAS-TV">the local news, weather, and  
sports</a>, or if you would like to compare <a 
href="http://www.infi.net/vegas/lvr/hotels.html">current room rates</a> 
and locate <a href="http://www.infi.net/vegas/vlv/eatout.html">major Las 
Vegas restaurants.</a>  Of course, no Las Vegas homepage is complete 
without a <a href="http://www.infi.net/vegas/vlv/games.html">gaming 
guide!</a>  Did you know that there are 114,668 slot machines and 3,722 
live table games in the county?  Or that Clark County casinos raked in $5.09 
billion in 1994?!?

<LI><A NAME="QQ5"><H2>How are businesses utilizing the internet 
nowadays to gain that extra advantage?</H2></A> 
I never knew that <a href="http://www.deltanet.com/nissan1">Universal 
City Nissan</a> (near Universal Studios Tour) has a homepage that 
introduces the dealership on a more friendly level.  If you're 
interested, you can read a biographya <a 
href="http://www.deltanet.com/nissan1/morrie.html">Morrie Sage,</a> the 
owner of the dealership.  Now how often can you do that if you just 
went to a dealership?  You can also do everything you're able to do at a 
Nissan dealership such as getting the specs on all the latest 
models, but short of actually test driving it.
<p>If you happen to be a <a 
href="http://www.deltanet.com/nissan1/nissan/nrace.html">car racing 
fan,</a> Universal City Nissan also has a small section that gives you 
Nissan's world racing schedule and a little photo gallery of shots of 
their hot performance cars.
