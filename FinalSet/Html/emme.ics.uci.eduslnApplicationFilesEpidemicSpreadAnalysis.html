<h2>Epidemic Spread Analysis</h2>
We first undertook micro-event detection on the data using keywords like ‘flu’, ‘H1N1’, ‘sore-throat’ etc. to detect user level micro event. Next we aggregated user interest patterns across whole US into ‘social image’ as shown in he figure alongside. Next we used a situation detection operator (segmentation in this case) on the social image to segment US into different zones with ‘Epidemic’, ‘Medium’, ‘Low’ levels of swine-flu activity. Based on the domain rules encoded, the situation based controller came up with relevant recommendations. The recommendation for each microblogger was decided (see Fig. 4) based on a combination of the micro-level event (e.g. Sore-throat) and macro situation parameter (e.g. ‘Level 3=Epidemic’, or ‘Level 1=Low activity’).
