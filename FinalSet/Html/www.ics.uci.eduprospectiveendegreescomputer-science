<P>
The Computer Science major emphasizes the principles of computing that underlie our modern
world and provides a strong foundational education to prepare students for a broad spectrum of
possible careers in computing. 
<P>
Students receive a balance of knowledge in low-level computer architecture and systems, 
middle-level infrastructure like programming languages, databases and networks, and high-level 
topics such as artificial intelligence, computer graphics and network security. Students also learn 
about the mathematical and algorithmic foundations that form the basis of modern computing. 
Subsequent courses allow students to concentrate in one or more such directions.

<DIV CLASS="section_content">
<P>
The CS major balances theoretical underpinnings with a strong emphasis on designing, programming and implementing large-scale systems. The curriculum covers the infrastructure of computers and networks, as well as the software that runs them. Students receive a broad view of the field through a comprehensive set of core classes and, through upper-division elective courses, are given the opportunity to specialize in topics such as machine learning, data mining, distributed and embedded systems, and security. The major places a heavy emphasis on “learning by doing” through a wide selection of classes in which students design and build in-depth projects over the course of a 10-week quarter. In addition, students receive a solid background in computer algorithms, which form the basis of modern computing. The major provides many practical skills that can be immediately put to use in the workplace while also giving students a conceptual foundation that will serve them well for the long term in a rapidly evolving field. <DIV CLASS="clear"></DIV>

Graduates of the Computer Science program at UCI will be in a position to pursue a variety of 
careers in high-demand areas such as embedded systems, cloud infrastructure, web services, 
computer security, networking and data mining. They can be principal designers or involved in 
implementation, typically at companies that design, implement and sell or manage products or 
services in such areas. They may find themselves in charge of large-scale deployments and/or 
customizations at the organizations that use them. 
<P>
The strong scientific preparation also allows students to become involved in such areas as 
high-performance computing, computational biology and neuroscience  — whether in industry or 
graduate school. In fact, many students choose to continue their studies, conducting research and 
earning graduate degrees in fields such as computer science, software engineering or information 
science. A background in computer science is also excellent preparation for careers in management, 
law, finance or consulting.

UC Irvine offers several ways to add depth scope, and experiential learning to your academic program of study. An academic counselor will help you determine the most efficient way to add another major, a minor or concentration to your academic plan, and will refer you to other campus programs and resources that support your interests and future goals. All Bren School majors in good standing may propose an academic plan that demonstrates the ability to complete the concentration and other requirements for graduation in a reasonable timeframe.

<UL class="content-list-large">
   
   <LI><STRONG>CONCENTRATION: Engineering and Computer Science in the Global Context. </STRONG>
       The globalization of the marketplace for information technology services and products makes it likely that Bren School graduates will work in multicultural settings or be employed by companies with extensive international operations or customer bases. The goal of the concentration is to help students develop and integrate knowledge of the history, language and culture of a country or geographic region outside the United States, through coursework both at UCI and an international host campus, followed by a technology related internship in the host country. 
       <P CLASS="sub-indent">
          <P><STRONG>Application:</STRONG><BR>
             Each student’s proposed program of study, specifying coursework and a guided internship experience in a region outside the U.S. must be approved in advance by the Bren School’s Associate Dean for Student Affairs. It is expected that each student’s proposal will reflect a high degree of planning that includes the guidance of academic counselors and those at the UCI Center for International Education regarding course selection, as well as considerations related to internship opportunities, housing and financial aid. The academic counselors and the Associate Dean will be available to assist qualified students with the development of a satisfactory academic plan, as needed.
      <P><STRONG>Requirements:</STRONG> <BR>
             <UL CLASS="sub-indent">
             <LI>A minimum of eight courses at UCI or at the international campus with an emphasis on the culture, language (if applicable and necessary), history, literature of the country that corresponds to the international portion of the program, international law, international labor policy, global issues, global institutions, global conflict and negotiation, and global economics;  </LI>
             <LI>A one- or two-semester sequence of technical courses related to the major and, possibly, cultural, history and literature courses taken at an international university; </LI>
             <LI>A two-month or longer technical internship experience in the same country as the international educational experience. </LI>

   <LI><STRONG>Bren School Honors Program.</STRONG>       Allows juniors and seniors enrolled in Bren School major (Biomedical Computing, Business Information Management, 
      Computer Game Science, Computer Science, Computer Science and Engineering, Informatics, Information and Computer 
      Science, or Software Engineering) to pursue advanced work in one of many research areas. Students who join the 
      program participate in an honors seminar, conduct independent research under the guidance of a faculty member, 
      and write a research paper.
