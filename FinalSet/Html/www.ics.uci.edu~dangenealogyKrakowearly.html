<H2>Early Records (before 1810)</H2>
</center>

Before mid-1805, surnames were not commonly used in Krakow.
<BR>
Patronymics were the norm,
the father's given name being used as a second name.
<BR>
(In earlier times,
a person's occupation was often used as a second name.)
<BR>
The databases indicate surnames in all caps. &nbsp;
Inferences are bracketed (<I>e.g.</I>, [PISEK]).
<P>
The progress of inferring surnames
has been enhanced by the contributions of many genealogists.
<!-- of many <a href=genealogists.htm>genealogists</a>. -->
<BR>
There are 1971 individuals in the 1790 census,
1916 individuals in the 1795 census,
and 1793 births listed 1798-1809.
<BR>
As of November 2003, 66% of the 1795 census families,
47% of the 1795 census entries,
and 83% of pre-1810 births,
have an identified surname.
<BR>
As of November 2003, 40% of the 1795 census entries
have been found in the 1790 census.
<!-- 765/1916 = 39.92% as of Nov 7 -->
<!-- 767/1916 = 40.03% as of Nov 11 -->
<!-- 773/1916 = 40.    as of Nov 16, '01 -->
<!-- 782/1916 = 40.8   as of Nov 1, '03 -->
<P>
It appears that houses 112-136 in 1790 correspond
to houses 113-137 in 1795.
Other house numbers appear to be consistent.
