<LI><A NAME="QQ1"><B>What is the World Wide Web?
</B></A><br>
My answer is... The<a 
href="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/DataSources/Top.html">World Wide Web</a> is a system which puts an endless 
information highway right at your fingertips. So you can seek out any 
information you want. From a variety of sources not only here at UCI, but 
also from countries all around the world. It's possible to find information 
on anything from<a 
href="http://www.cis.ufl.edu/~thoth/library/recreation.html"> 
recreational activities</a> and travel sites to topics about 
the<a href="http://ecosys.drdr.virginia.edu/Environment.html"> 
environment</a>. So let the World 
Wide Web be your tour guide to unknown facts and places around the world. <p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>
   
<LI><A NAME="QQ2"><B>What is a Hotlist?</B></A><br>
My answer is... A Hotlist is an option given to you on the World Wide Web 
that allows you to keep a list of neat things you find on the web, by saving 
them to that list. It also let's you go back to that particular point that 
you found interesting at any point in time. Some interesing things that I 
found on the Web, and elected to save on my Hotlist include the<a 
href="http://akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo/"> 
Yahoo</a> directory, The<a href=http://ea.oac.uci.edu/">UCI Antweb</a>,<a 
href="http://akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo/Entertainment/Games/">Entertainment 
and Games</a> catalog, The<a 
href="http://www.nando.net/sports/bkb/1994/bkbserv.html">Basketball 
server</a> 
  
for you sport fans, and the<a href="http://bazaar.com/underground.html"> 
Underground Home Page</a>. Which I think is pretty cool. <p><A 
HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ3"><B>What is the role of the United Nations?</B></A><br>
My answer is...The<a href="http://www.undcp.org/unlinks.html">United 
Nations</a> throughout its History has played a 
major role in World politics as well as the role of peacekeeper in times of 
conflict. This is a special time for the U.N. because they are also 
celebrating their<a 
href="http://www.amdahl.com/internet/events/un50.html"> 50th 
anniversary.</a> The United Nations deals with 
much more than just<a href="http://ralph.gmu.edu/cfpa/peace/toc.html"> peace 
keeping missions.</a> It also deals with<a href="http:// 
ananse.irv.uit.no/trade_law/nav/uncitral.html"> trade 
laws,</a> and<a href="http:// www.undcp.org/index.html"> drug programs.</a> 
Exploring some of these links will 
give you a better idea of just what the U.N. does and how it works.

<LI><A NAME="QQ4"><B>What are some interesting cultural facts of the African-American people?</B></A><br>
My answer is...Their are many interestin cultural facts about African 
American people and their heritage. In searching the World Wide Web I 
found many good starting points to better understand the<a 
href="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/DataSources/bySubject/AfricanStudies/africanWWW.html"> African American 
people</a> and their culture. The most interesting would have to be<a 
href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/exhibits/African.American/intro.html"> The 
Library of Congress.</a> Another good spot to 
start is the<a href="http://www.afroam.org/afroam/"> Afro-American Home 
Page.</a> If art is your thing there is a great exhibit in the web, that 
deals with<a 
href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/dic/exhib/93.ray.aa/African.html"> 
African American art.</a> If you want a better 
idea of how African American students feel about race relations try<a 
href"=http://cowheat.student.princeton.edu/maffairs/AfroNet.html"> 
Afro-Net.</a> <p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ5"><B>What are some cool facts about Whales?</B></A><br>
My answer is... In searchin the World Wide Web I stumbled across a section 
on <a href="http://www.physics.helsinki.fi/whale/#USA">whales.</a> I learned 
some pretty cool facts and stories about different 
types of whales. In different areas of the World. In Hawaii they have 
<a 
href="http://nearnet.gnn.com/gnn/meta/travel/features/foster/hawaii/hawaii2.html">Whale 
watching cruises</a> from February to March. Here are some neat 
pictures I found on the Web you might want to check out, <a href="http://www.physics.helsinki.fi/whale/images/wha12.gif">one<a/> and <a 
href="http://www.physics.helsinki.fi/whale/images/wha22.gif">two.</a> I 
recommend 
exploring this area in greater depth because it is truly interesting. <p><A
