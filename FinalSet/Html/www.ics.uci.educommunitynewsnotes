<p>
The National Science Foundation has awarded a grant to Bren Professors 
<strong>Gary Olson</strong> and <strong>Judith Olson</strong> 
for their project &#8220;VOSS: Micro-Analytics of Collaboration in Distributed Work: What Makes Collaboration Work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The study is a four-phase examination of the micro-processes of collaborative document creation to identify what processes and tool features ensure a high-quality end product &#8212; and to determine what new features might contribute to more successful collaborations. Distributed work has become ubiquitous in industry as well as in the sciences, but, as the project abstract notes, current theories of collaborative work were generated when technology-supported distributed work was less common. With the help of nearly $397,000 in NSF funding, the Olsons will expand these theories to include the collaboration patterns when people use new tools and cope with the challenges of being distant.

<p>
Professors <strong>Michael Carey</strong> and <strong>Chen Li</strong> have received $750,000 from the National Science Foundation and nearly $400,000 from corporations &#8212; including Google, Oracle and HTC &#8212; to continue the development of their Big Data system, AsterixDB.
</p>
<p>
Carey, Li and UCI project scientist <strong>Vinayak Borkar</strong> developed the system in collaboration with Vassilis J. Tsotras, a professor at the University of California, Riverside. AsterixDB promises to be the most versatile among platforms aimed at managing Big Data; the open source software is now available for free download at 
<a href="http://asterix.ics.uci.edu">http://asterix.ics.uci.edu</a>.
</p>
<p>
The AsterixDB engine operates on a &#8220;shared nothing&#8221; architecture, in which each computer node is independent and self-sufficient. Its distinct advantages come by adding management of semi-structured data (data not organized in the traditional tabular form), supporting a variety of data types (e.g., spatial and temporal as well as textual and numeric data), and borrowing techniques from parallel databases that increase the speed and scale at which it can operate.

<strong>Peter Sadowski</strong> and <strong>Michael Zeller</strong>, both Ph.D. students with the Department of Computer Science, earned a second-place finish in an international data-mining competition. The honor was given by sbv IMPROVER, a collaborative project designed to enable scientists to learn about and contribute to the development of a new crowdsourcing method for verification of scientific data and results. 
</p>
<p>
Sadowski and Zeller, students in professor <strong>Pierre Baldi</strong>&#8217;s group and researchers at the Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics, developed a pipeline for translating protein phosphorylation status from rat primary lung cells to human primary lung cells after subjecting cells to various stimuli consisting of known drugs and chemicals. Their pipeline consisted of two parts: an artificial neural network; and a statistical analysis that aggregated evidence from the replicated measurements. They placed second out of 13 teams and were awarded travel-cost reimbursement to the 2013 sbv IMPROVER Symposium in Athens, Greece, where they presented their findings.

Professors <strong>Judith Olson</strong> and <strong>Gary Olson</strong> have 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Working-Together-Apart-Collaboration-Human-Cenered/dp/1608450503">published a new book</a>, 
titled <em>Working Together Apart: Collaboration over the Internet</em>. Published by Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers, the Olsons&#8217; new offering reviews the latest insights into how teams work together when they are not in the same location. 
</p>
<p>
Guided by a framework they developed during two decades of research on this topic, the professors organize a series of factors they have found to differentiate between successful and unsuccessful distributed collaborations. They then review the kinds of technology options that are available today, focusing more on types of technologies rather than specific instances. They describe a database of geographically distributed projects they have studied and introduce the Collaboration Success Wizard, an online tool for assessing past, present, or planned distributed collaborations. The book closes with a set of recommendations for individuals, managers, and those higher in the organizations who wish to support distance work.

In the latest issue of 
<a href="http://www.uctc.net/access/43/access.shtml">ACCESS Magazine</a>, professor <strong>Amelia Regan</strong> explores the implications of vehicular communication networks. Such systems allow vehicles to sense not only traffic patterns, but also dangers outside a driver&#8217;s line of sight. These abilities improve driving efficiency and safety and are the first steps towards an automated driving network. But what happens if the communication network fails? Or worse, is hacked into?
</p>
<p>
Regan&#8217;s article, &#8220;<a href="http://www.uctc.net/access/43/access43_almanac.shtml">Vehicular ad hoc Networks: Storms on the Horizon</a>,&#8221; describes the advantages and challenges these networks present. While the latest technology turns both cars and even pedestrians into nodes on the network, issues of security, privacy and liability continue to be major barriers to broad implementation.

<p>
Computer science faculty <strong>Xiaohui Xie</strong> and <strong>Chen Li</strong> have been awarded a three-year grant of nearly $662,000 from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to develop new computational tools essential for future advances in sequencing human genomes.
</p>
<p>
DNA sequencing has become an indispensable tool for basic biomedical research, understanding disease mechanisms and the development of new, increasingly personalized treatments. Current sequencing of an individual&#8217;s genome is done by extracting short segments of DNA, randomly sampling those segments and then assembling the hundreds of millions, or even hundreds of billions, of pieces into a whole genome, which remains a costly undertaking. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, which enable the rapid generation of billions of bases of genes at relatively low cost, pose a significant computational challenge on how to analyze the large amount of sequence data efficiently and accurately. 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Although a number of computational tools have been developed to address this problem, they are insufficient in mapping and studying genome features located within repeat, duplicated and other so-called unmappable regions of genomes,&#8221; says Xie. 
</p>
<p>
The primary goal of his NIH-funded research is to develop computational algorithms and open-source software to improve both the efficiency and accuracy of NGS analysis tools and expand the accessibility of those tools to previously understudied regions. This will create a new way of mapping the sequencing to the reference genome, identifying all mapping locations instead of one or only a few. That will be followed by a machine-learning method to resolve ambiguously mapped reads by pooling information from the entire collection of reads.
</p>
<p>
UCI computer scientists on the project are collaborating with biologists developing NGS assays to study biomedical problems, including Timothy Osborne of Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, Kyoko Yokomori of the UCI School of Medicine and Ken Cho of UCI&#8217;s School of Biological Sciences. 
</p>
<p>
The UCI team&#8217;s work to reduce the cost and improve the accuracy of sequencing ultimately may make it possible to create an individual patient&#8217;s genome as part of a routine diagnostic procedure.

<p>
Bosch Research and Technology Center has awarded computer science professor 
<strong>Gene Tsudik</strong> 
$50,000 to support his efforts to enhance privacy in embedded systems. This grant represents the first partnership between Bosch and UC Irvine.
</p>
<p>
The term &#8220;embedded systems&#8221; refers to systems that control specific functions within a larger structure. Embedded systems help control everything from pacemakers, security systems and cell phones to planes, trains and automobiles. Used by the billions in countless applications, these systems have become essential to daily life. As long as they operate safely and effectively, most of us never even think about them.
</p>
<p>
Tsudik, who also directs the Secure Computing and Networking Center (<a href="http://sconce.ics.uci.edu/">SCONCE</a>) at UCI, continuously explores ways to increase the security of such systems. Bosch Research and Technology Center &#8212; the research arm of one of the world&#8217;s leading manufacturers of appliances, automotive components, security systems, medical equipment and many other devices dependent on embedded systems &#8212; sought Tsudik&#8217;s collaboration in research on embedded systems security.
</p>
<p>
As more devices use embedded systems, and as these systems increasingly communicate with other equipment, privacy becomes even more challenging and essential. &#8220;Communication between embedded systems is like opening a new door,&#8221; Tsudik observes. &#8220;Once that door is open, you never know who &#8212; or what &#8212; might come in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Through his collaboration with Bosch and his ongoing research, Tsudik seeks to improve security and to maintain integrity of embedded devices in the most efficient manner.

The National Science Foundation has awarded computer science professor <strong>Max Welling</strong> and assistant professor of statistics <strong>Babak Shahbaba</strong> $500,000 to fund the project "Efficient Bayesian Learning from Stochastic Gradients." 
</p>
<p>
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a technique that allows one to draw representative samples from almost any probability distribution. While the MCMC technology has revolutionized the usefulness of Bayesian statistics over the last few decades, it has not been able to scale well to today&#8217;s very large data problems. Welling and Shahbaba will examine a new family of MCMC procedures that requires only a few hundred data-cases per update. 
</p>
<p>
"We believe this new class of methods will for the first time unlock the full strength of Bayesian methods for very large datasets," stated Welling and Shahbaba in their NSF proposal. "Due to their highly practical nature, the techniques developed under this grant are likely to gain widespread acceptance across a broad spectrum of academic disciplines as well as in industry."
</p>
<p>
The grant will enable UC Irvine students to collaborate with students and postdocs from the University of Oxford and the University of Bristol. Research results will be integrated into artificial intelligence and machine learning courses at UCI through class projects.

&#8220;Planar Lombardi Drawings for Subcubic Graphs,&#8221; authored by computer science professor <strong>David Eppstein</strong>, has recieved the best paper award in the combinatorial and algorithmic aspects track of the 
<a href="http://www.gd2012.org/bpa.html">20th International Symposium on Graph Drawing</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Lombardi drawing is a style of information visualization inspired by the art of Mark Lombardi, who drew social networks in which the nodes and edges represent the players and financial connections in international conspiracies &#8212; using a style characterized by curved edges and even node spacing. Eppstein&#8217;s 
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6142">paper</a> 
uses circle packings and hyperbolic geometry to show how to construct Lombardi drawings for every planar graph that has, at most, three edges per node. 
</p>
<p>
Eppstein&#8217;s research focuses on many topics in computational geometry and graph algorithms, including: graph drawing and information visualization; dynamic graph algorithms and dynamic closest pair data structures; and mesh generation and optimal triangulation.

<p><b> Gene <br/> Tsudik </b></p>
</div>
<p>
Cisco Systems has awarded $95,000 to help support the work of computer science professor <b>Gene Tsudik</b> in making the next-generation Internet more secure. An expert in computer security and privacy, Tsudik leads a team that is exploring security advantages and strengthening potential weaknesses of Named-Data Networking (NDN) in preventing denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Such attacks disable their victims by overloading them with communications from &#8220;zombies&#8221; or &#8220;bots&#8221; &#8212; that is, computers that have already been compromised by hackers for malicious purposes.
</p>
<p>
NDN aims to replace the current Internet Protocol (IP). Rather than the IP method of assigning names to computers and addresses to their network interfaces, NDN names the content that travels through the network. To provide trust in communicated information, each piece of named content must be signed by its producer.
</p>
<p>
The current IP-based Internet allows anyone to &#8220;talk&#8221; to any entity, such as a computer or a router. This opens the door for DoS and attack types. And attacks are not the only problem with today&#8217;s Internet. Tsudik says the Internet&#8217;s decades-old architecture &#8220;was not designed for the kind of communication that takes place over it today: web traffic and rich multimedia communication. It was primarily designed for email and remote terminal access.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
In other words, the Internet is not just threatened by hackers and other miscreants; it is also a victim of its own popularity. Billions of people use it intensively, and cracks are starting to show.
</p>
<p>
Tsudik is one of a number of experts from dozens of institutions who answered the call from the National Science Foundation to construct a more resilient future Internet architecture. To make that next incarnation safer from attacks (such as DoS), Tsudik and his group at UCI are collaborating with colleagues at the Palo Alto Research Center &#8212; where the security team is lead by Ersin Uzun, a former Ph.D. student of Tsudik&#8217;s &#8212; and UCLA. They are also jointly exploring privacy protection techniques for NDN.

</div>
<p>
Informatics associate professor <strong>Donald Patterson</strong>, with co-authors Lin Liao, Dieter Fox and Henry Kautz, have been recognized with the inaugural AIJ Prominent Paper Award. Their paper, &#8220;<a href="http://luci.ics.uci.edu/websiteContent/weAreLuci/biographies/faculty/djp3/LocalCopy/learning.pdf">Learning and inferring transportation routines</a>,&#8221; was published in volume 171 (April 2007) of the <a href="http://www.journals.elsevier.com/artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a> journal. It introduces a hierarchical Markov model that can learn and infer a user&#8217;s daily movements through an urban community, and applies it in an application that helps cognitively-impaired people use public transportation safely.
</p>
<p>
The recently instituted AIJ Prominent Paper Award recognizes outstanding papers published not more than five years ago in the AI Journal that are exceptional in their significance and impact. Factors considered for the award include: the paper&#8217;s influence on a new line of research, whether the paper has made any major theoretical advances, and whether the paper has influenced applications.
</p>
<p>
Patterson said he and his co-authors have decided to donate their 500 Euro prize &#8212; which Google will match 1:1 &#8212; to the Alzheimer&#8217;s Association, &#8220;which is in line with the ideas in the paper.&#8221; Patterson&#8217;s current research interests focus on context-aware computing and how to make a computer operate appropriately when it leaves the office and moves into the greater world. He is a faculty affiliate of LUCI (Laboratory for Ubiquitous Computing and Interaction).

<p><b> Magda <br/> El Zarki </b></p>
</div>
<p>
Professor of computer science <strong>Magda El Zarki</strong> has received a nine-month Fulbright-Nehru Teaching/Research Fellowship to pursue her research on networked games and virtual worlds at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. 
</p>
<p>
With the advent of online gaming and the tremendous success of this new application area, El Zarki&#8217;s research thrust has shifted to studying the networking requirements of online game technologies, in particular Massively Multiuser Virtual Environments (MMVEs). With the anticipated growth in this application area, more and more stress is being placed on the underlying transport system to provide the kind of quality of experience (QoE) that these applications and their users expect. The quality of an end user&#8217;s experience is the true litmus test of a proper online game deployment. El Zarki&#8217;s Fulbright research project, &#8220;Networked Games and Virtual Worlds,&#8221; will further explore how understanding both the application and network facilities for QoE can ensure the highest quality user experience.
</p>
<p>
El Zarki is director of the Center for Computer Games and Virtual Worlds and heads the computer game science degree program at UC Irvine. She is an editor for several journals in the telecommunications field and is actively involved in many international conferences.
</p>
<p>
The Fulbright Program is the flagship international educational exchange program sponsored by the U.S. government and is designed to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the people of other countries.

<p><b><a name="summer_2012_franz_software_diversity_patent_and_grant"></a>Franz wins a U.S. Patent on software diversity and over $900,000 in new grant funding to investigate software diversity </b></p>
<div class="img_caption_left"><img alt="photo: Michael Franz " height="90" src="../../../bin/img/photos/faculty/franz.jpg" width="70"/>
<p><b> Michael <br/> Franz </b></p>
</div>
<p>
Professor <strong>Michael Franz</strong> and two of his former Ph.D. students were just awarded a patent by the U.S. Patent Office for a fundamental invention in the field of software security. The patent, on which Prof. Franz is the first named inventor and which is assigned to the Regents of the University of California, protects the idea of using program diversity in conjunction with parallel programming to protect a computer against malicious hacker attacks.
</p>
<p>
Like many major inventions, the idea is quite simple at the core: instead of generating a single binary from a source program, a special compiler generates several slightly different program versions that implement the program's functionality in subtly different ways. These different versions are then executed in lockstep on a multicore processor.
</p>
<p>
The key idea is to generate the versions in such a way that all "in specification" behavior is identical across the versions, but "out of specification" behavior differs significantly. As a result, the versions will execute in lockstep as long as the program is behaving
as designed, but will typically diverge as soon as an attacker exploits a programming bug, causing "out of specification" behavior. This can be detected almost in real time.
</p>
<p>
In addition to this U.S. Patent, Prof. Franz won over $900,000 in additional funding for his work on software diversity in the past month. First, he won an additional year of funding from DARPA for his project "Defending Mobile Apps Through Automated Software Diversity." The existing project, on which Dr. Franz is the sole PI, has been extended through February 2015 along with an additional award of $467,442, bringing the total to $1,847,602. Second, he received a
further award of $456,809 from the Navy on a subcontract from Johns Hopkins University for his project "Meta-Circular Software Diversity for Intrusion Tolerant Clouds."

<p>
Associate Research Scientist <strong>David Newman</strong> has been awarded a $600,000 grant by the National Science Foundation, with funds split equally with co-Investigator Meg Blume-Kohout, an Economist at University of New Mexico.
</p>
<p>
Newman and Blume-Kohout's interdisciplinary research will combine machine learning and econometrics to create models that assess effectiveness and efficiency of biomedical funding, focusing on the National Institutes of Health.
</p>
<p>
"In this current age of scarcity, two things are required: fiscal restraint, and an accurate assessment of research effectiveness and efficiency" says Newman. "Matching publications and grant funding levels by machine learned topics will allow us to evaluate the contribution of publicly-funded research to the body of published research.  Our models will be able to measure whether changes in funding for a topic affect the quality and quantity of publications on that topic."</p>

&#8220;<a href="http://icml.cc/2012/papers/782.pdf">Bayesian Posterior Sampling via Stochastic Gradient Fisher Scoring</a>&#8221; 
won the best paper award at the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning 
(<a href="http://icml.cc/2012/">ICML 2012</a>) 
held in Edinburgh, Scotland.
</p>
<p>
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a technique that allows one to draw representative samples from almost any probability distribution. According to the paper, while the MCMC technology has revolutionized the usefulness of Bayesian statistics over the last few decades, it has not been able to scale well to today&#8217;s very large data problems. The authors&#8217; new method borrows ideas from Stochastic Approximation Theory to improve the efficiency of MCMC samplers and make them relevant to big data challenges.

</p>
<p>
According to the award citation: 
<i>This paper from the SIGMOD 2002 Conference remarkably anticipated the world of &#8220;Database as Service&#8221; which did come about and continues to grow in importance. To get a sense of how visionary the work was, consider that this paper was published in June 2002 (and thus accepted in Jan 2002), even a couple of months before Amazon EC2 and S3 services were launched (of course, Amazon RDS and SQL Azure came much later). The core of the paper focuses on the challenges of how to leverage cloud services while keeping some of the information (at the discretion of the enterprise/user) hidden from the service provider. Beyond the specific algorithmic details, the key contribution is the framework: (i) introduction of a mapping function, and (ii) query splitting logic to ensure how the work can be distributed across cloud and client when some information is encrypted. Is this framework used by enterprises today? As best as we can tell, the answer is perhaps no. But, is the framework interesting and has real possibilities of adoption and further impact and more follow-on by research community? Absolutely. In summary, this paper is one of the early papers to foresee the world of Database as Service (before any one of us were working on that problem). The specific technical focus was dealt with reasonable depth. The impact of the technical focus has not yet been seen by the industry but this paper has the possibility of inspiring much more follow-on work/thinking (beyond 140+ citations it already has in ACM DL). </i>

As the 2011-12 <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/community/news/press/view_press?id=113">Athena Lecturer</a>, Bren Professor Judy Olson presented &#8220;Broader Impacts: Research You Can Use&#8221; at the Association for Computing Machinery Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work.  
</p>
<p>
According to Olson&#8217;s abstract: 
<i>A number of threads of thought have come together recently having to do with how we make our research useable and useful to the world. One thread is inspired by a movement in medicine called Clinical Translational Science in which funding is given to researchers to translate basic research into guidelines, treatments, and regimens that clinicians can use. A second thread arose in reflecting about our own recent work in which we translated a theory about what makes for good distance collaboration into an online assessment tool and administered it to hundreds of people involved in remote collaboration. Upon completion of the assessment, each participant immediately gets a personalized report on the strengths of their collaboration, the challenges, and what to do about it. We get the data, and they get the help. These two threads point to making a difference, having broader impact. In this talk I will review some ways we can have an impact, both directly to people, through design practice (our clinicians), and via a myriad of other tools while doing good research. I encourage us all to spend more energy on having more direct effects on the world in which we live. </i>

Informatics associate professor <strong>Bill Tomlinson</strong> and his group, in collaboration with assistant professor of education Rebecca Black, received a $50,000 grant from Constellation Energy in support of their work on the &#8220;Causality Project.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>	
Through a novel online system currently in the works, the Causality Project collects information about the cause-and-effect relationships across a wide range of topics, to help people understand how everyday decisions can affect the environment.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;By illustrating chains of causality, which can often be indirect and complex, we hope to encourage people to recognize the ripples they make, big or small,&#8221; Tomlinson says. &#8220;For example, people may not think about where their power comes from or the effects brought about by the generation, distribution and use of that power. The Causality Project aims to address this type of disconnect.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Constellation Energy awarded 14 E(2) Energy to Educate 
<a href="http://ir.constellation.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=625179">grants</a>
in 2011 to support hands-on projects that enhance student understanding of the science and technology needed to address energy issues. Tomlinson&#8217;s grant will enable the team to launch a contest next year among UC Irvine undergraduate students to contribute to the Causality Project and create online videos about indirect causal chains related to energy issues in their own lives. Participants will work in interdisciplinary teams to learn about energy technologies, the environmental impacts of various energy systems, and how these systems relate to their world. Students will then use this new knowledge to create an online repository of causal linkages among energy issues and other topics of global importance.

</div>
<p>
Computer science professor <strong>Michael Franz</strong>, as sole PI, has been awarded a three-year $500,000 grant by the National Science Foundation to create better virtual machines (VMs).</p>
<p>
A virtual machine is an &#8220;ideal computer&#8221; built out of software. &#8220;Most people use multiple VMs every day,&#8221; Franz explains. &#8220;For example, web applications such as Gmail or Google Maps run on a JavaScript VM inside of your web browser, animations run on Adobe&#8217;s Flash VM, and, if you are using an Android mobile phone, most of the apps on that phone run on a VM called Dalvik. Running software on virtual machines rather than directly on hardware creates cross-platform portability and provides some insulation against malicious or faulty programs.&#8221; </p>
<p>
Franz&#8217;s research project aims to simplify the development of virtual machines and improve their architecture, especially when used on mobile devices. The project has garnered additional support from Samsung, which awarded a supplemental $350,000 to Franz this spring.</p>
<p>
Franz continues: &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t make sense to have three separate VMs (JavaScript, Flash and Dalvik) on a cell phone, where space is at a premium, when these VMs are actually quite similar to each other under the hood and have lots of overlapping functionality.&#8221; Franz&#8217;s research aims to create a modular VM that can support multiple languages while using only a fraction of the space. Rather than compete for processor resources and memory, the modules of the VM supporting the various languages would collaborate with each other.</p>
<p>
Franz leads the Secure Systems and Languages Laboratory at UC Irvine, one of the top research teams on dynamic compilation, virtual machines and language-based computer security. In collaboration with the Mozilla foundation, he transitioned the JavaScript compilation technology invented in his lab into the Firefox browser, where it is used every day by hundreds of millions of people.

A paper on efficient handling of fully-sequenced human genomes &#8212; co-authored by computer science professors
<strong>Pierre Baldi</strong> and <strong>Gene Tsudik</strong>, recent alumnus <strong>Emiliano De Cristofaro</strong> (Ph.D. &#8217;11), postdoctoral researcher <strong>Paolo Gasti</strong>, and Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics researcher <strong>Roberta Baronio</strong> &#8212; will be presented at the 18th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security in Chicago. Titled &#8220;Countering GATTACA: Ef&#64257;cient and Secure Testing of Fully-Sequenced Human Genomes,&#8221; this paper addresses the issue of privacy in the emerging field of digital genome sequencing and already has been featured on the 
<a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/arxiv/27252/?p1=blogs">MIT Technology Review</a>
home page and as a feature article in the journal

The authors have devised methods for implementing privacy-preserving operations over digital genome sequences. These genome sequences could be stored by users on their computers or smartphones and queried in secure and private ways in several applications, ranging from medical, to authentication, to social interactions. This work is supported in part by a grant from the National Institutes of Health.</p>

<strong>Padhraic Smyth</strong>, professor of computer science and director of the Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems at UC Irvine, has been awarded two grants worth $2.9 million by the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity 
(<a href="http://www.iarpa.gov/index.html">IARPA</a>), 
a center housed within the 
<a href="http://www.dni.gov/">Office of the Director of National Intelligence</a>, 
for research on statistical text mining. 
</p>
<p>
The first project &#8212; with co-investigators <strong>David Newman</strong>, assistant researcher in computer science at UCI, and <strong>Mark Steyvers</strong>, professor of cognitive sciences at UCI &#8212;will focus on developing new statistical topic modeling algorithms to help users automatically search and understand large amounts of unstructured text. Funded by a $1.3 million IARPA award over four years, the project is a collaborative effort with Cornell University, the University of Maryland, UC Santa Barbara, the University of Massgachusetts Amherst and Purdue University.
</p>
<p>
Supported by a $1.6 million five-year award from IARPA, the second project focuses on developing models and algorithms for automatically detecting and quantifying trends and changes in scientific literature. In a recent 
<a href="http://www.iarpa.gov/Media/28_iarpa_fuse_research.pdf">news release</a>, 
IARPA announced that the Foresight and Understanding from Scientific Exposition (FUSE) Program seeks to produce a new capability to accelerate the process of identifying and prioritizing emerging technologies across the globe. Smyth and co-investigator Newman will develop algorithms that can detect statistically significant changes in language usage and citation patterns to measure how scientific disciplines are evolving over time. FUSE will be carried out in collaboration with researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology, the University of Michigan and the University of Illinois. 
</p>
<p>
Both projects will build on research by Smyth, Newman, Steyvers and their students, who for the past few years have been developing statistical models and algorithms for automatically extracting information from text. These techniques have broad applications in such areas as Web search, digital libraries and biomedical text mining.

<strong>Michael Franz</strong>, UCI Computer Science Professor, has received a three-year $1.38 million award from DARPA&#8217;s Transformational Convergence Technology Office to investigate a new defense against software attacks. 
He is the sole PI of the project, which is inspired by biodiversity in nature and aims to create a similar diversity in the software that runs on the world&#8217;s computers. Currently, all users of a program download the exact same version of that program from a hosting site or an App Store. In Franz&#8217;s approach, the App Store will contain a diversification engine that will generate a unique version of every program for every user. This process will occur automatically inside of the AppStore, so that neither the software creators nor the users downloading it need to be aware of it.
</p>
<p>
From the end-user&#8217;s perspective, the different versions are indistinguishable and they all behave in exactly the same way, but internally, subtle differences make it impossible for an attacker to use the same attack for all the versions.
</p>
<p>
In order to make a large-scale attack successful, a perpetrator would have to launch many different attacks and would have no way of knowing which attack would succeed on which target. Equally important, this also makes it much more difficult to generate attack vectors by reverse-engineering security patches.

<strong>Bill Tomlinson</strong>, Informatics Associate Professor, delivered a plenary address last week in Washington, D.C. at a workshop that explored research challenges facing worldwide sustainability. 
Sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the Computing Community Consortium, 
<a href="http://cra.org/ccc/seesit.php">&#8220;The Role of Information Sciences and Engineering in Sustainability&#8221;</a>
aimed to identify new research opportunities in the information sciences and engineering that address sustainability objectives.
</p>
<p>
Tomlinson&#8217;s talk, &#8220;IT and (Un)sustainable Cultures,&#8221; addressed core societal principles that he believes are the root causes of our greatest environmental concerns. Specifically, he said, industrialized civilizations&#8217; emphases on growth and consumption are deeply unsustainable. 
Profound transformations in personal, institutional and infrastructure goals will be necessary to support a more sustainable existence and IT can play an important role in this evolution. 
</p>
<p>
He discussed the concept explored in his book, &#8220;Greening through IT,&#8221; that environmental issues occur on broad scales of time, space and complexity, but humans work best at narrower scales. &#8220;IT can help bridge this gap, enabling us to understand the complex chains of causality that underlie global climatic disruption, biodiversity loss, sea level rise and a host of other environmental issues,&#8221; he said. 
IT is also implicated in the creation of the world&#8217;s current environmental problems, he said, calling it a &#8220;force multiplier&#8221; that allows people to accomplish more and more. One way to approach these problems is to explore the ways in which IT can help alter unsustainable cultural norms and provide acceptable alternatives.
</p>
<p>
For example, he said, IT systems can help support local sustainable agriculture, public health, education and nutrition. They can provide social support and identity via social networking, virtualized workspaces and other support networks. These systems can also help people learn more about the world and how to live sustainably in it. 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;These are not new ideas,&#8221; he said. But in order to create necessary cultural change that can lead to increased sustainability, &#8220;we need more IT researchers to work on these projects.&#8221;

His talk, <a href="http://dbs.ilectures.curtin.edu.au/lectopia/lectopia.lasso?ut=3236&amp;id=72536">&#8220;Usable Security: The Case of Secure Pairing of Wireless Devices,&#8221;</a> focused on the process of creating an initial secure channel between multiple wireless devices that were previously unassociated, for example: two cell phones, a cell phone/Bluetooth combination, or an MP3 player and a wireless headset. Lack of a prior security context and absence of a global security infrastructure opens the door for so-called "man-in-the-middle" or &#8220;evil twin&#8221; attacks.
</p>
<p>

<p>
Computer science professors <b>Chen Li</b> and <b>Xiaohui Xie</b> have been awarded a $371,000 two-year grant from the National Institute of Health to develop novel search methods for mining biomedical literature.
</p>
<p>
The MEDLINE database, complied by the United States National Library of Medicine, is a comprehensive bibliographic database of life sciences and biomedical information. The database contains more than 19 million records from approximately 5,000 selected publications, covering much of the literature in biomedicine and health.  The database is also growing fast, with thousands of updates every day.
</p>
<p>
Searching MEDLINE has become an indispensable component in the daily life of medical practitioners, biological researchers, and an increasing number of patients who prefer to seek medical information through their own hands.
</p>
<p>
Currently, searching MEDLINE is primarily conducted through the PubMed web server, maintained by National Center for Biotechnology Information of NIH, which handles millions of searches per day. Given the high popularity and importance, it is critical to study how to make MEDLINE search more powerful and easier to use.
</p>
<p>
Li and Xie, together with collaborators at Tsinghua University, China, have developed a system called <a href="http://ipubmed.ics.uci.edu">iPubMed</a>, to study how to support instant, error-tolerant search on MEDLINE publications.
</p>
<p>
Their published paper in the journal <a href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/18/2321.abstract">Bioinformatics</a> demonstrated that the experience of searching MEDLINE can be significantly improved by instant search.
</p>
<p>
In the new search paradigm, a user can view the search results instantly as he or she types each letter of the query. Because the user can modify the query on the fly according to the instantly returned results, it can take much less time for them to locate the right items.
</p>
<p>
This new search model is also gaining popularity in other domains. For instance, Google recently released a new web search tool called Google Instant, which implements the similar idea. The error-tolerant feature is especially important when the user does not remember the exact spelling of the keywords, such as a disease name or an author name.
</p>
<p>
The NIH grant will support Professors Li and Xie&#8217;s research efforts to further improve the iPubMed system.
</p>
<p>
Li's research interests are in the fields of database and information systems, including Web search, large-scale data management, data cleansing, and data integration.
</p>
<p>
Xie's research focuses in machine learning, bioinformatics, computational biology and neural computation. He is interested in both developing novel machine learning theory and algorithms, and applying them to practical problems, such as biology and medical science.

<p>
Computer science professor <b>Rina Dechter</b>, with her students,&#160;has won first place in the 2010 Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI) Approximate Inference Challenge.  The UAI community is focused on developing algorithms for answering queries over knowledge-bases known as "graphical models" that represent both certain and uncertain information about the world.
</p>
<p class="p1">For example, the algorithms can express the information that if an individual is a smoker, their chances for developing cancer are higher than someonw who is&#160; a non-smoker. Given such statements with numerous additional such rules with and without numerical probabilities, which involve numbers in a particular domain such as medicine, researchers want to answer a variety of questions.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;When we get &#8216;evidence&#8217; or observations, we want to know how they change our &#8216;belief&#8217; about certain other facts,&#8221; says Dechter. &#160;</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;The evidence in the example is &#8216;Peter is smoking&#8217;, and I want to know the probability that &#8216;Peter has cancer.&#8217;&#160; Or, I can have evidence that &#8216;Peter has cancer&#8217; and the question I am interested in is what is the probability that &#8216;Peter smokes.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">Overall, when there is a probabilistic graphical model describing some world &#8211; such as the medical domain in the example above &#8211; and evidence on specific individual conditions, computer scientist often attempt to compute such answers.</p>
<p class="p1">The UAI challenge is third in a series of events that challenge the UAI community to provide their code for approximation algorithms so that&#160; they&#160;&#160; all work on&#160; the same set of problems and run on the same machines. The results are then announced.</p>
<p class="p1">In the UAI 2010 challenge Dechter and her team compared algorithms on each of three tasks, and for 3 different lengths of time, comparing the accuracy of their results against actual results.</p>
<p class="p1">Of the nine competing teams, Dechter with&#160; Vibhav Gogate (currently a postdoctoral student at university of Washington) &#160; were placed first on the&#160; two tasks and (with&#160; Lars Otten) placed third place on the third task.</p>
<p class="p1">Professor Dechter's research centers on computational aspects of automated reasoning and knowledge representation including search, constraint processing and probabilistic reasoning. The primary aim of her research is to devise efficient methods through the understanding and exploitation of tractable reasoning tasks.</p>
<p class="p1">Professor Dechter is an author of the book "Constraint Processing" published by Morgan Kaufmann, 2003, and has authored over 100 research papers.&#160;</p>

<p>
<b>Gary</b> and <b>Judy Olson</b>, Bren Professors in Information and Computer Sciences, have been awarded $400,000 for their research entitled &#8220;Next Steps in Articulating Success Factors for Distributed Collaborations.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The Olsons have spent the past decade studying work at a distance, both in science and engineering venues as well as in corporations.  During this time, they have identified the major the factors that make for success in work at a distance.  From these, the Olsons have developed a preliminary theory, called the Theory of Remote Scientific Collaboration (TORSC), published in 2008.
</p>
<p>
Given this theory, the Olsons have developed an online assessment device called the Collaboration Success Wizard, which goes through each of the important factors in question form and either confirms that the collaboratory has a good chance of success or suggests a remedy for the factors that are not met. 
</p>
<p>
These assessments and data collected from the tool will be directed at deepening the understanding of what differentiates successful from unsuccessful distributed collaborations, and provide guidance to those who are developing such collaborations.
</p>
<p>
Gary and Judy Olson expect that their research will have major implications for the emergence of successful virtual organizations to facilitate distance collaborations, in science and beyond.
</p>
<p>
Gary Olson, author of more than 120 published research articles, has dedicated his work to understanding how technology can support remote collaboration. He also has made important contributions to the studies of management practice and the cultural aspects of collaboration, as well as the complex socio-technical issues surrounding technology design.
</p>
<p>
Judy Olson has published about 110 published research articles and is best known for her work on distance collaborations and has achieved international acclaim for her studies that compared office workers in geographically distributed organizations to those working in the same location.
</p>
<p>
They are both Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery, and were jointly awarded the ACM SIGCHI Lifetime Achievement Award.

<p>
Bren Professor of Information and Computer Sciences <b>Ramesh Jain</b> has received ACM&#8217;s Special Interest Group on Multimedia (SIGMM) Technical Achievement award.
</p>
<p>
The award, given in recognition of outstanding contributions over a researcher&#8217;s career, cited Jain&#8217;s &#8220;pioneering research and inspiring leadership that transformed multimedia information processing to enhance the quality of life and visionary leadership of the multimedia community&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
The SIGMM award will be presented at the ACM International Conference on Multimedia 2010 that will be held October 25-29, 2010 in Florence, Italy.
</p>
<p>
Jain has made pioneering contributions in the areas of multimedia information systems, image databases, machine vision, and intelligent systems for more than three decades.  His early work on accumulative difference pictures established the dynamic vision field that has directly influenced today&#8217;s digital video processing. Many techniques such as background subtraction, tracking, and event detection were first introduced in his pioneering papers in this field. 
</p>
<p>
In 1992, Jain proposed and organized the inaugural NSF workshop on visual information management systems that established a new research direction leading to the enormous advances that we see today in content-based analysis and search of images and video. Jain has pioneered techniques that analyze content and combine information from multiple sources.
</p>
<p>
His emphasis in recent years on event-based representation and analysis of multimedia data has led the community&#8217;s focus to be on live dynamic data. In fact, he has recently pioneered the first comprehensive multimedia Event model which is increasingly being adopted.
</p>
<p>

<b>Max Welling</b>, professor of computer science, has been awarded European Conference on Computer Vision&#8217;s Koenderink Prize in recognition of his computer vision research paper that has &#8220;withstood the test of time.&#8221; Entitled &#8220;Unsupervised Learning of Models for Recognition,&#8221; the paper was originally published in 2000.
</p>
<p>
The research paper presents a method to learn object class models from unlabeled and unsegmented cluttered scenes for the purpose of visual object recognition. The authors focused on a particular type of model where objects are represented as &#64258;exible constellations of rigid parts (features):
</p>
<blockquote>
&#8220;The variability within a class is represented by a joint probability density function (pdf) on the shape of the constellation and the output of part detectors. In a &#64257;rst stage, the method automatically identi&#64257;es distinctive parts in the training set by applying a clustering algorithm to patterns selected by an interest operator. It then learns the statistical shape model using expectation maximization. The method achieves very good classi&#64257;cation results on human faces and rear views of cars.&#8221;
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>Gene Tsudik</b>, professor of computer science, has been awarded $600,000 from the National Science Foundation (NSF)&#8232;as part of  the Named Data Networking (NDN) project in the NSF Future Internet Architecture (FIA) program.  The goal of &#8232;FIA is to design a more effective, trustworthy and robust Internet protocols and techniques.
</p>
<p>
Led by Professor Lixia Zhang of UCLA, the NDN project will focus on Internet architecture that moves the communication paradigm from today's focus on "where" (i.e., Internet addresses, servers, and hosts), to "what" (i.e., content that &#8232;users and applications care about).
</p>
<p>
Current Internet communication is based on a client-server model of interaction: communicating parties establish &#8232;a relationship and then proceed to transfer information contained within IP packets transported along one or more paths. However, the most predominant use of the Internet is actually centered on content creation, dissemination and delivery, &#8232;and this trend will continue for the foreseeable future. While the basic client-server model has enabled a wide range of services and applications, it does not offer adequate mechanisms to support secure content-oriented functionality, &#8232;regardless of the specific physical location where the content resides.
</p>
<p>
By naming data instead of its location (IP address), NDN transforms data into a first-class entity. &#8232;While the current Internet mainly secures the channel between communication points,&#8232;NDN secures the content and provides essential context for security. NDN allows the decoupling of trust &#8232;in data from trust in hosts and servers, enabling trustworthiness as well as several very scalable &#8232;communication mechanisms, for example, automatic caching to optimize bandwidth and the &#8232;potential to move content along multiple paths to the destination.
</p>
<p>
This goal of this project is to address technical challenges in creating NDN, including: routing scalability, &#8232;fast forwarding, trust models, network security, content protection and privacy, as well as new &#8232;fundamental communication theory.
</p>
<p>
UC Irvine will focus specifically on security and privacy aspects of the NDN architecture. Besides UCLA, other collaborating institutions include: PARC, Yale, Washington University and Colorado State.
</p>
<p>
Gene Tsudik's research interests include computer/network security, privacy and applied cryptography. &#8232;His recent work focuses on privacy in Internet services, RFID systems, mobile ad hoc networks, as well as &#8232;security in sensor networks and storage systems.

<p>Computer science professor <b>Michael Franz</b> has been named the recipient of the 2010-11 Academic Senate Distinguished Award for Mid-Career Research &#8212; the Academic Senate&#8217;s highest honor for excellence in research.
</p>
<p>Professor Franz, along with former graduate student Andreas Gal, is the inventor of Trace Compilation, a radically new way of building just-in-time compilers.  This technique is widely regarded as the single biggest invention in compilers in 20 years.  His research impact currently extends to 500 million people globally using software that integrates his technique, such as Mozilla&#8217;s Firefox browser.  In addition, Franz&#8217;s research has enabled third world countries to connect using no-cost cloud software such as Gmail and Google Docs, thereby closing the gap in the &#8220;digital divide&#8221;. </p>
<p>Franz&#8217;s invention is a radical departure from the long-established convention of  &#8220;control flow graph&#8221;, a technique used for over five decades to model a program&#8217;s control flow that a compiler builds and then traverses while generating code.  Instead of constructing a control-flow graph of the program, Franz&#8217;s patent-pending technique called Trace Tree utilizes an intermediate representation that is constructed on-demand while the program is simultaneously executed, incrementally compiled and optimized. </p>
<p>The advantage of the Trace Tree technique is that it utilizes one-seventh (1/7) of the memory footprint and one-thirtieth (1/30) of the compile time of traditional compilers.  Working with the Mozilla foundation, Franz has incorporated this technique into the Firefox browser, beginning with version 3.5.  By incorporating the Trace Tree, Mozilla was able to raise Firefox&#8217;s JavaScript performance 700%. </p>
<p>Franz is currently in collaboration with Adobe to incorporate his just-in-time compiler into their next version of Flash.  In addition, Google&#8217;s Android team has adopted Trace Compilation for the next generation smart phone operating system.  These integrations coupled with the Firefox deployment will result in the impact of potentially several billion devices. </p>
<p>Professor Franz is director at UC Irvine&#8217;s Secure Systems and Software Laboratory. A Distinguished Scientist of the Association for Computing Machinery and a Senior Member of The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Franz has graduated 13 Ph.D. students, been awarded more than $7 Million in competitive Federal research funding as Principal Investigator, and has published more than 90 refereed papers. </p>

                   received a a Best Paper nomination at the CHI 
Conference 2010. Entitled, &#8220;Intermediated Technology Use in
                   Developing Communities,&#8221; the paper is published in 
the Proceedings of  the ACM Conference on Human Factors
                   in Computer Systems. </p>
<p>The paper describes a prevalent mode of information 
access in low-income communities of the developing world&#8212;
                   intermediated interactions. The research takes an 
ethnographic look of two urban slums of Bangalore, India, studying
                   how digitally skilled users can enable persons for 
whom technology is inaccessible due to non-literacy, lack of
                   technology-operation skills, or financial 
constraints. </p>
<p>The paper presents some requirements and challenges 
in interface design of these interactions and explains how they
                   are different from direct interactions. They go on to
 explain the broader effects of these interactions on low-income
                   communities, and present implications for design. </p>

<p>A program to train scientists to better manage vast, 
complex datasets, and a center that will
                   transform human mobility through information 
technology and robotics, have been selected as the
                   first recipients of the Large-Scale Interdisciplinary
 Research Ignition Initiative sponsored by
                   Calit2, The Henry Samueli School of Engineering and 
the Donald Bren School of Information and
                   Computer Sciences. </p>
<p>The funding program, announced last December, aims to
 promote interdisciplinary research that
                   will evolve into large-scale, agency-funded projects 
or centers in the areas of health, energy,
                   environment, information, communications or digital 
technologies. </p>
<p>The selection committee, comprised of deans Debra 
Richardson and Rafael Bras, and Calit2 Irvine
                   director G.P. Li, chose the iScience project and 
iMove Center based on their multidisciplinary
                   nature, likelihood of attracting significant funding 
from outside agencies, innovation,
                   scientific value and long-term impact. </p>
<p>iScience seeks to address the escalating volume of 
data collected by natural scientists, who
                   increasingly are stymied by the sheer size of the 
datasets. Data-driven computing faces
                   challenges in storing and managing these large, 
complex distributed and dynamic data collections,
                   and needs radically new tool sets and visualization 
schemes to effectively explore, mine,
                   understand and extract new knowledge from the 
information. </p>
<p>Project PI <b>Magda El Zarki</b> 
(information and computer science) and co-PI
                   <b>Crista Lopes</b> (informatics) propose a
 program to educate students, along with
                   their faculty, across disciplines to create a new 
crop of scientists who are knowledgeable in
                   the basic concepts of natural and computational 
sciences. </p>
<p>The iMove Center, led by co-PIs David Reinkensmeyer 
(mechanical and aerospace engineering, and
                   biomedical engineering), Steve Cramer (neurology), 
Mark Bachman (electrical engineering and
                   computer science) and <b>Walt Scacchi</b> 
(information and computer science) will
                   search for ways to use information technology, 
robotics and neuro-regenerative therapies,
                   including dance, sport and computer games, to improve
 human mobility and challenge patients
                   beyond what is possible with current rehabilitation 
models. </p>
<p>Researchers hope to help shape new brain circuits and
 assess movement recovery with novel
                   electrophysiological, functional imaging and 
behavioral outcome measures. The center also seeks
                   to produce technologies useful to those without 
disabilities, including innovative, interactive
                   training and performance technologies for sport and 
dance. </p>
<p>Each winning project will receive grants totaling 
$40,000: $20,000 now and $20,000 when a
                   proposal is submitted to an outside agency requesting
 a minimum of $500,000 per year for at
                   least 3 years.  Additional calls for proposals for 
the initiative will occur in October 2010 and
                   February 2011. </p>
<p>"We are pleased to be a part of this new 
multidisciplinary initiative that will ultimately
                   benefit society," said Calit2's Li, "and we look 
forward to the long-term success of our first
                   two recipient projects." </p>

                   have received the Best Paper Award at the IEEE 
Virtual Reality 2010 conference held in Boston. </p>
<p>The paper, entitled "Auto-Calibration of Cylindrical 
Multi-Projector Systems," explores registering
                   multiple projectors on vertically extruded a 
cylindrical display, which previously was only possible with
                   a calibrated stereo camera. </p>
<p>This papers shows that using some simple priors, one 
can achieve multiple projector registration on a
                   cylindrical display using a single uncalibrated 
camera without any markers on the display.  More
                   importantly, the new method enables use of multiple 
overlapped projectors across corners of a vertically
                   extruded surface with sharp edges. This is of 
tremendous benefit to virtual reality display systems like
                   CAVEs, that avoided mounting projectors across the 
corners until today. </p>

 in a could-computing environment, such as Google App Engine. The 
techniques
                   developed in this project will have a broad impact on
 many information systems that are moving to the cloud-computing 
paradigm.
                   The team will use the Google Person Finder project as
 a real application to test the techniques, and could provide the 
techniques
                   and source code to be used in family reunification 
during future disasters. </p>
<p>Li's research interests are in the fields of database
 and information systems, including data integration, data cleaning, Web
                   search, and large-scale information processing using 
parallel computing. </p>

<p>Research Scientist <b>David Newman</b> has 
been awarded a $25,000 NSF EAGER Award for his research entitled 
"Analyzing
                   Grant Portfolios through Topic Modeling."  The goal 
of this research is to develop and apply topic models &#8212; Bayesian models
                   for document collections &#8212; to model and analyze 
collections of grant proposals and their metadata (funding amount, NSF
                   Directorate, NSF Program, etc.). </p>
<p>The award will be used to develop and demonstrate 
tools to help NSF program officers better analyze, visualize and 
interact with
                   large collections of both unfunded proposals and 
funded projects.  This will both help streamline the grant proposal 
review and
                   decision process, and help NSF understand what areas 
of research could use more funding, or are under-represented. </p>
<p>Newman's current research focuses on theory and 
application of topic models and related text mining techniques.  His 
research is
                   marked by a commitment to combining theoretical 
advances with practical applications in ways that widen access and use 
for
                   individuals and communities, and ultimately improve 
the way people find and discover information. </p>

<p>Professor <b>Sharad Mehrotra</b> and 
Assistant Adjunct Professor <b>Dmitri V. Kalashnikov</b> have 
been awarded
                   a Google Research Award for $50,000 for a research 
effort entitled "Exploiting Entity Resolution for Web People Search." </p>
<p>The goal of this research is to explore a novel 
graphical domain-independent framework that exploits semantics of 
various forms to
                   improve data quality. Data quality challenge is 
ubiquitous in various domains - it arises whenever we collect and create
 large
                   repositories of information, especially when 
information is captured and assimilated automatically. </p>
<p>The award will be used to develop an adaptive 
self-tuning entity resolution framework which will be used to build an 
online search
                   engine that can disambiguate amongst namesakes on the
 Web. The system will exploit web queries and search engine statistics 
for
                   disambiguation. </p>
<p>Mehrotra's current research focuses on next 
generation database management systems that provide natural and 
efficient support for
                   complex multidimensional data sets. Multidimensional 
data sets abound in numerous application domains in which database 
technology
                   is currently being deployed. For example, medical 
information systems require databases to provide native support for 
X-rays,
                   volumetric MRI scans, and time varying volumetric 
information. </p>
