<h1>Uing VHDL to Design a Sequential Circuit</h1>
</center>
<h2>Lab 2</h2>
<p> The objective of this lab assignment is to design a
sequential circuit. You will submit your specification&nbsp;and
your VHDL code through EEE.
</p>
<p> Please read <b>ALL</b> instructions carefully. <b>Only
</b> <a href="./index.html#SUBMISSION">properly
submitted</a> assignments will be graded. Each group should only
submit one copy.&nbsp;Don't forget to mention your partner's name
in the files.</p>

Your task is to design a 3-bit counter that counts by an increment of
5. A counter generates a series of numbers with each clock cycle.
Regular 3 bit counters would increment the couter value by 1 every
interval and the output would be 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1
... and continue to repeat. Our by-5 counter increments the counter
value by 5 each time, and the output would be 0 5 2 7 4 1 6 3 0 5 ... <br>
<p>The design should consist of 2 parts, a combinational circuit
that
"computes" the next value based on the current value, which we call it
the "calculator"; and a sequential
circuit that "remembers" the current value and "updates" to the next
one with clock, which we call it the "register".</p>
<p>First, you should specify the calculator with a truth table,
then write down the logical expression. Feel free to simplify the
expression. Name the input signal C (as in current) and the output
signal N (as in next). Draw a gate-level schematic for your optimized
expression.</p>
<p>Second, you should show how to connect the register with the
calculator, as well as reset and clock signals, in a block diagram.
There are 4 ports to the register: reset, clock, input, and output.
There are 2 ports to the calculator: current and next.</p>

and
unpack it.
</p>
<p>The by-5 counter module (that is, the lab2 entity) has two
1-bit inputs (clk and reset_N) and one 3-bit output (count). The rising
edge of the clock signal clk triggers the counter to the next value.
The reset signal <b><i>reset_N</i></b> sets
the output of the counter to 0 <span style="font-style: italic;">asynchronously</span>,
which means counter value chages to 0 immediatly when reset signal
arrives, even without the clock trigger. Remember, reset_N is a
low-active signal.</p>
Your VHDL design should consist of a combinational logic section
implemented via concurrent signal assignments (i.e. using logical gates
such as AND, OR, NOT, etc.) and a register update process.
<p> The top level of your design should be called <b>lab2</b>
and needs to have the following ports (in <b>the same order</b>
as given here, with <b>the same names</b>):
</p>
<p><b>Inputs</b>:<br>
clk: std_logic<br>
reset_N: std_logic<br>
</p>
<p><b>Outputs</b>:<br>
count:std_logic_vector (2 downto 0)
</p>
<p> Name and order of the ports in your design is important. <b>To
receive full credit please follow the order and assign names as above.</b></p>
<p style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Verification
</b>Due Friday,

<p>Your test bench should generate a clock signal. The clock
cycle time should be 10 ns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, verify the counting functionality by applying at least
10 clock signals to the counter. You should try to start couting from
different values. Take 2 screen shots for 2 different inital values.</p>
<p>Second, verify the reset siganl can reset the counter to zero
asynchronously. Also veryfy that the counter would start counting again
after the reset signal is removed. The reset signal may not necessarily
change at the same time as the clock. Take a screen shot of the waveform.</p>
<hr><b>What you should produce in this lab:</b>
<ol>
<li>A specification for your design, including the&nbsp;truth-table,
the logic expressions and the schematics for the calculator, and a
top-level block diagram for the complete counter.</li>
</ol>
Please submit the specification by Monday, 4/16/2012 at 3pm.
<ol start="2">
<li>Your VHDL design. </li>
