<h1>Middle of the Pyramid</h1>
To define necessary technical requirements, we classify world populations into three categories, as shown in Figure below. At the top layer of the pyramid (TOP) about 1.5 billion people have access to immense information resources using a variety of tools including their mobile phones. At the bottom of the pyramid (BOP) about 2 billion people are deprived of any modern means of communication. At the Middle of the Pyramid (MOP) are about 3 to 4 billion people who have mobile phones but not access to the vast information resources available to people at the TOP.<br>
