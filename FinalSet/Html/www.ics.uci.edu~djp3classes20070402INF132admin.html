<div class="container">
  <p><span class="style5">Attendance</span>: </p>
  <div class="indentRight">
    <p>Students are responsible for material that is distributed during class. If you miss class, please arrange before-hand with a friend to get notes/handouts for you. If you know you are going to miss something important, contact the instructor beforehand. It's much easier to accommodate planned absences. </p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="container">
  <p><span class="style5">Announcements</span>: </p>
  <div class="indentRight">
    <p>Critical announcements will be emailed to your UCI Net ID / Login. Please make it is set up properly and being forwarded to whichever account you normally read email from. Many other announcements will be made in class.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="container">
  <p class="style5">Email correspondence: </p>
  <div class="indentRight">
    <p>To make sure that the instructor, TA and/or Reader see your email, please include the class number, &quot;INF 132&quot;, in the subject line. If you do not get a response to the email in 24 hours (except weekends), please resend it or come to office hours. </p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="container">
  <p class="style5">Late Penalty</p>
  <div class="indentRight">
    <p>Generally speaking the late penalty is 1% per hour after the due date.</p>
    <p>Due dates are usually 11:59pm on the day an assignment is due. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="indentRight"></div>
</div>
<div class="container">
  <p class="style5">Sick Policy </p>
  <div class="indentRight">
    <p>If you find that you are unable to make it to a scheduled event (exam, presentation, etc.) of some sort due to sickness, please get some documentation from a health care provider to assist us in maintaining fairness to the other students in the class. In the absence of such documentation, please contact the staff as soon as you realize that you are going to miss a scheduled  event. Generally sicknesses will be treated on a case by case basis. We will accommodate you as best as we can depending on the circumstances. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="indentRight"></div>
</div>
<div class="container">
  <p class="style5">Add/Drop: </p>
  <div class="indentRight">
    <p>Electronic Add/Drop only. Standard University time lines apply. </p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="container">
  <p class="style5">Incompletes:</p>
  <div class="indentRight">
    <p>I will only offer an incomplete grade to a student who, through some unforeseen emergency, is unable to complete the requirements of the course. </p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="container">
  <p><span class="style5">Academic honesty:</span></p>
  <div class="indentRight">
    <p> Please familiarize yourself with the latest UCI academic honesty policy: <a href="http://www.editor.uci.edu/catalogue/appx/appx.2.htm">http://www.editor.uci.edu/catalogue/appx/appx.2.htm</a>. </p>
    <p>The consequences of academic dishonesty are not worth the risks. </p>
    <p>In a nutshell - you may never use anyone else's work without clearly acknowledging the source. This includes code you find on the web, text from books, and answers from friends. If an assignment requires you to do the work yourself, then acknowledging the source of an answer does not fulfill the requirements of the assignment. I reserve the right to fail students who do not display complete academic integrity. </p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="container">
  <p class="style5">Web Page and Readings:</p>
  <div class="indentRight">
    <p> The Web page for the class is subject to update. Check it frequently and be sure to refresh / reload the Web pages when you browse them.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="container"><span class="style5">Students with Disabilities or Special Needs:</span><br />
  <div class="indentRight">Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation based on the impact of a disability (or anything else) should contact me privately to discuss his or her specific needs. Also contact the Disability Services Center at (949) 824-7494 as soon as possible to better ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.</div>
