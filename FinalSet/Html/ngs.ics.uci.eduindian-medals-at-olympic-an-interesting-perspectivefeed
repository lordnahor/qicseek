		<description><![CDATA[I think sportsmen from India  will have good olympic results in the future since the population of the country is growing and it will be easy to find young talents. But this is only possible if the country will invest in sports of course.

Good luck to future  Indian sports stars!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I REALLY hope corruption becomes an olympic sport. Our politicians can beat the pants off of any other country! :)  
Abhinav won not becuase of the sporting facilities provided by Indian government but because he was rich enough (not negating his talent and commitment in anyway here!)  to setup his own shooting range in his backyard.  Sadly, he had to buy his own air ticket to go to China from Germany (where he was training) because the &quot;babus&quot; would issue tickets only if you board a flight from Delhi. Arg! :(

		<description><![CDATA[I remember India being &quot;dominant&quot; in mens field hockey but they failed to qualify this year after a long time. Will cricket ever be an olympic sport?  As the announcer stated about India &quot; in a land of over a billion people India manages to get only 57 representatives&quot; If there was an outsourcing sport...NOW that would be won by India :)]]></description>
