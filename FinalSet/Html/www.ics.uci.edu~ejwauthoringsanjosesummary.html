The BOF on WWW Distributed Authoring and Versioning was held on
Wednesday, December 11, 1996, from 09:00-11:30, with 79 people in
attendance over the duration of the meeting.  Jim Whitehead
presented an overview and history of WWW Distributed Authoring and
Versioning, including information on how to become involved in the
work of the DAV group, which was followed by a detailed presentation on the
current DAV functionality requirements.  There was a lively discussion
on the requirements, including such issues as lock administration, use
of public key technology, access control models, the degree of
intelligence of "move" functionality, and recommendations of related
protocols and systems to investigate (such as AFS, IMAP, and ACAP for
their models of access control).  These issues will be discussed
further on our mailing list.  At the end of the session, the attendees
were polled on whether they thought it would be worthwhile for the
IETF to work on WWW Distributed Authoring and Versioning.
Overwhelmingly, the attendees thought the IETF should pursue work in
this area (the vast majority were in favor, with 2-3 opposed, and a
handful of abstentions).
