				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have always heard, for as long as I remember, that correlation and causality are not the same.  That is OK.  They are indeed different.<br />
But there is always this implication by many, if not the most, people that correlation is second class and causality is the first class.  Causality should be respected while one should be cautious about correlations.</p>
<p>It bothers me whenever I hear that implication about the superiority of causality.  To me it is like saying that invention is better than necessity or that a baby is better than his mother.  Clearly there is a strong relationship between a mother and a baby and every mother wants her baby to go much farther than her.  It is important to remember, however, that baby follows mother.  Similarly, if there is no necessity than there is no need for invention, or without an established causal necessity, an invention is worthless.</p>
<p>Correlation is observed in data and then only people think of finding out the causal chain.  Except in purely theoretical reasoning, correlation seeds the need for causality.  Hence, I say that &#8216;Correlation is the Mother of Causality&#8217;.</p>
<p>In these days of Big Data (hype) if there is some thing really important, it is to understand correlations because then only causality may be explored and established.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last decades have been the decades of disruption. Books (including encyclopedia and newspapers), music, phones, and retails are among those who have already been metamorphosed, thanks to rapid advances in technology, and have to be creative just for survival.  Now, people are talking about the transformation of one of the most basic human activities â€“ learning â€“for some time.  Clearly, learning and education are going to be transformed very soon, possibly as soon as by 2020.  Recognition of Sugata Mitraâ€™s â€˜Hole in the Wallâ€™ computers for learning and spread of MOOCs (Massive Online Open Courses) are just harbingers in learning and education.</p>
<p>Education and learning are suppose to go together and be synergistic. Ironically, however, education often comes in the way of learning.  Education is a top down activity that reflects societal needs, while learning is the most primitive human desire to satisfy curiosity and grow.  Unfortunately, the way education evolved in society, it started taming or even hindering human learning.  Institutionalization of education resulted in stronger focus on grades and degrees rather than what they are supposed to reflect &#8212; the learning.  As we have seen disinter-mediation transforming some other basic societal functions, in education and learning also we are soon likely to see such disinter-mediation.</p>
<p>The disruption in education and learning is significant.  Like Gutenbergâ€™s invention resulted in democratization of knowledge creation and dissemination, the impending transformation will address acquisition and transmission of knowledge.  This is time for our society to seriously consider this issue for its own growth.  It is important to consider societal need for educated people as a synergistic activity with basic human desire to learn and explore.  In developing the next generation systems, technology can play a crucial role in such a development.</p>
<p>Developing countries, like India, are poised to be most affected by this imminent shift due to their current inadequate education system  as well as their current demographic dividend.  They are facing a cusp; take advantage of the demographic dividend or let it whither away and turn into a demographic curse.  Fortunately, the changes brought by technology offer an opportunity for them to leapfrog and utilize its demographic advantage to become a leader.  </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Twitter became a very powerful medium and its popularity soared rapidly.  Twitter became a major News source for the latest events.  And it remains a popular site.  Many academic researchers are exploring all aspects of twitter ranging from how it is used, how information propagates on it, how can one get information, how can one detect sentiments, and so on.  Twitter data has become a good source of research papers for many budding researchers in different research fields.  On the other hand, many companies build products using Twitter data. Products ranging from early detection of trends, popularity of politicians, to sentiments of people on a particular topic have been productized.  However, there are some limitations of Twitter data for many applications.  </p>
<p>Twitter data is so broad in scope that any topics can be found in tweets, but unfortunately all topics are mixed together. If we treat the relevant information as signal, and all others as noise, twitter data has very low signal-noise-ratio (SNR).  Use of tools like hash-tags help, but do not really solve the problem.  Given this about current Twitter like social network, we believe that they all suffer serious issue of low SNR and are less effective as information sources. Therefore, we propose the concept of Focused Micro Blogs (FMB).  FMBs are on a focused topic and are targeted to a specific source.  Since the topic is fixed, the information in a FMB could be easily structured and parsed.   FMBs retain the important feature of sending brief real time information of Tweets, while overcoming their weakness of combining too many different topics in one place. This information is aggregated at a server designed for a specific task.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s consider one concrete example of FMB in a popular application for traffic â€“ the Waze.  Waze is an application on phones that takes GPS data periodically from the phone and uses this to compute the speed of the device.  This is aggregated at the server to know traffic conditions in different areas.  A user may also do a micro-blog using specific input mechanisms so that the system knows about a stalled car or a police officer at a specific location.  By using sensor data from the phone and specific micro-blog-inputs, a Waze server provides very useful information to its users.  This is an FMB in action.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are living in transformative times.  Our society is going through a major transformation both at the individual level as well as at the global level.  The most important factor in this transformation, the fuel powering this new engine, is the data; particularly the objective data collected using sensors.  However, data from only a specific sensor contains only partial truth about its environment.  Each sensor is designed to capture a particular attribute and most objects and events have several attributes that may change with time.  The fidelity of an object or an event improves with more diverse sensors to capture their attributes.  These attributes are captured by sensors recording the attributes as a time-varying signal at specific locations.  Billions of sensors are now continuously measuring different physical attributes at most locations of interest in the world.  Increasingly, a good fraction of these spatio-temporal measurements are being made available on the Web, giving us opportunity to create Web Observatories.</p>
<p>A very important and well recognized fact is that each data stream has valuable information.  But when two data streams are correlated it results in valuable insights.  As more number of data streams are correlated, better insights are created.  Thus, the fact that one can gain valuable insights by correlating multiple data streams collected for the same event or same person is well recognized, but techniques for doing this automatically have not been developed as well.  Currently, we are collecting increasing amount of such data leading to what is commonly called Big Data.  Data from different sensors is usually at different spatial resolution as well as at different frequencies.  Moreover, the type of data is multi modal, making the semantics of the data very different.  This poses serious problems in correlating these data streams.  We need efficient tools to correlate all such data streams to gain valuable insights.</p>
<p>Here we consider a specific case of such data being collected related to a person to create the persona that may be used in different contexts.  The persona of a person models different aspects of a person that are relevant to interactions with the person or for taking specific actions involving the person.  In this paper, we will consider a very limited case to understand building such an aspect of the persona of a person using different data streams.  The aspect that we consider is related to fitness and health and the data streams that we will consider are related to many sensors now being used by people to collect fitness data, personal events, eating habits, sleep patterns, and every day activities as collected using mobile phones and social networks.  Our goal is to understand challenges faced in correlating data from all these diverse data streams and develop a computational platform that will allow us to plug-in other data streams to include them in refining the persona.</p>
<p><strong>Health-Persona</strong></p>
<p>Until recently, and in most cases even now, all information about a person was very subjective.   Consider all information related to fitness and health related information about an individual.  We all had anecdotal information about how much exercise we do, how many hours we sleep, what we eat, and how our body is feeling.  But the recent information technology revolution is changing that.  Using a myriad fitness related wearable sensors, combined with mobile phones every minute of an individualâ€™s activities are being recorded that may be analyzed. We have seen a revolution that allows capturing information about â€˜selfâ€™ from many sources. What we are seeing is a major shift in how we got information about individuals.  In this paper, unless specifically mentioned, we will discuss fitness and health related information.  In this area, we can characterize changing trends into specific classes:</p>
<p><strong>Subjective Self:</strong> All information about a person was totally subjective.  This information could be collected from several sources, but it was mostly subjective interpretation by a person, including self, about the state of health.</p>
<p><strong>Quantified Self:</strong> People started collecting information using different sensors. Usually sensors donâ€™t lie, they give fairly objective information. Also, many sensors could be collecting data 24/7 and storing this on a server where this data could be analyzed.  This data is collected using a sensor for a specific aspect of fitness or health.  Such data could be visualized and some analytics could be done to help a person.</p>
<p><strong>Objective Self:</strong> Using multiple wearable sensors, people collect 24/7, many different attributes related to fitness and health.  Mobile phones and other sensors also collect information related to travel and location of activities that could be converted into different events in their personal life.  Information from personal calendar, social networks and other similar sources is also used.  All this information can be correlated to analyze lifestyle and help people in fitness and health.</p>
<p>We address more detailed aspects of observing and analyzing all data sources to get objective self health information and identify needs to build a powerful platform to accomplish this.</p>
<p><strong>(Will Continue)</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There was a time, not really long ago, when all information about a person was very subjective.  Even self opinions were subjective and other people&#8217;s opinion were always way out there.  But that was before the information technology revolution.  The info tech revolution started changing things.  And the last few years have been nothing but revolutionary in this area.  Now we have seen a revolution that allows capturing information about &#8216;self&#8217; from many sources &#8212; sometimes I feel too many sources.  Granted some of them are still subjective like when my wife criticizes me, but many of them are becoming very objective like ehen my Nike FuelBand says that I had a wonderful day.<br />
What we are seeing is a major trend:</p>
<p><strong>Subjective Self:</strong> All self as well as others opinions were totally subjective.</p>
<p><strong>Aggregated but still subjective self:</strong> When we aggregate subjective information to get some objectivity in it.</p>
<p><strong>Quantified Self:</strong>  People start collecting information about self using sensors.  Usually sensors don&#8217;t lie, they give fairly objective information.  But people are just collecting data for some aspects of their life.</p>
<p><strong>Objective Self: </strong> When people will collect objective information from several sources and use it for their benefit and interactions in society.</p>
<p>I am very excites about this,  But this may end my self deception.</p>
