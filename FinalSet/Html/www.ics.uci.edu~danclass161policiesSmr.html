<BR> Even if you don't have lots of spare time, you may find it
     profitable to work on some of these problems.
<BR> It is possible that some of these problems
     will also appear on exams.
<LI> Some problems are marked with an <font color=blue>*</font>,
     indicating that they may be more challenging.

     but will be checked for effort.

     No late submissions will be accepted.
