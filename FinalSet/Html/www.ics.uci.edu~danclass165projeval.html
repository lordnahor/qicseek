<H1 align=center>CompSci 165 Project Submissions and Evaluation</H1>

<H2>Project Policy</H2>
<UL>
<!--
<LI> Each project must be worked on individually and independently
<LI> No assistance is permitted from anyone besides the class instructor
<LI> Code must be original, and may not be copied or shared from any
     other source, except as provided by the class instructor
-->
<LI> Each project is to be done by teams (see Team Policy, below)
<LI> You may make use of ideas found in any book, journal, or website.
     HOWEVER, you must be careful to give proper attribution to any such sources
     by indicating in your code and in your project write-up the full reference
     (book/journal title, author, and page number or full URL of the webpage)
     for each such source
<LI> Code must be original, and may not be copied or shared from any
     other source, except as provided by the class instructor
</UL>

<H2>Team Policy and Registration</H2>
<UL>
<LI> Teams for each of the CompSci 165 projects consist of <U>two</U> CompSci 165 students
<LI> For each project, students choose their teammates by mutual consent and agree who will be the team head member
<LI> Two students who were teammates for one CompSci 165 project
     may not be teammates for any subsequent CompSci 165 project
<LI> For each project, the head member of each team shall send a "registration email"
   <UL>
   <LI> to be sent from the head member's UCI email address
   <LI> to be sent to the class Assistant, with cc to the class instructor and to the other team member's UCI email address
   <LI> contains (1) full names and (2) UCI ID names of the project team members
   <LI> to be sent not later than the <font color=blue><I>registration due date</I></font>
          listed on the Class Schedule
   <LI> a return email will acknowledge receipt of the team registration
   </UL>

<!--
<LI> For each project, the head member of each team shall
<BR> send a "registration email" from their UCI email address to the class Assistant and also to the class instructor
<BR> stating (1) the full names and (2) the UCI ID names of the project team members,
     with cc to the other team member's UCI email address
     <UL>
     <LI> This email must be sent not later than
          the <font color=blue><I>registration due date</I></font>
          listed on the Class Schedule
     <LI> The class Assistant will send a return email, acknowledging receipt of the team registration
     </UL>
-->
</UL>

<H2>Project Submissions</H2>

<UL>
<LI> Each project has associated with it a <font color=blue><I>deadline due date</I></font>.
<LI> The project will be collected electronically
     just after 9am on the morning of the due date
     using the <I>checkmate</I> system.
<LI> For each project, the <U>team head member</U> should submit via the <I>checkmate</I> system
     a zip file containing the following:
       <UL>
       <LI> <tt>makefile</tt>, enabling automatic compilation
       <LI> All source files
       <LI> <tt>README.txt</tt>, containing documentation, analysis
            and other comments.
            <BR>(<font color=blue>This must be a plaintext file.</font>  Do not create a Word file.)
       <LI> If you have any, sample run outputs should be in a file
            named <tt>OUTPUT.txt</tt>
       </UL>
</UL>

<H2>Project Evaluation</H2>

Projects will be evaluated based on the following broad criteria:
<UL>
<LI> <I>Correctness</I> --
  the program system works <B>according to project requirements</B>
  <UL>
  <LI> C/C++ source compiled
       (using the <tt>make</tt> utility) using gcc/g++ on Linux
  <LI> a <tt>makefile</tt> must be provided
  <LI> no syntax errors, no run-time errors,
       and the correct output must be produced
  <LI> improper input gracefully handled, allocated space returned
       after it no longer is needed, and error-checking performed
       after calling any system or library function
  </UL>
<LI> <I>Testing, timing</I> --
  correct implementation of ancillary functions needed for
  the complete project but not part of the project specifications
  <UL>
  <LI> code needed for I/O
  <LI> code needed for testing
  <LI> code needed for timing
  </UL>
<LI> <I>Program structure</I> --
   well modularized, no gross inefficiencies (space or time)
<LI> <I>Internal documentation</I> --
   concise comments, indentation, descriptive variable names, explain "magic" numbers
<LI> <tt>README.txt</tt> -- <font color=blue>keep this very short please</font>
  <UL>
  <LI> how to use the program
  <LI> description of data structure implementation
       (some of this may be internal)
  <LI> theoretical time analysis of the underlying algorithms
  <LI> production of a function (based on your timing and analysis)
       to predict the time required by your system for larger instances
       of the problem
  <LI> accurate analysis of the space requirements
  </UL>
<LI> <I>Bonus points</I> --
  each project may specify special features or competitive characteristics (versus other teams)
</UL>
