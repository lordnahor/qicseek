<h2> Abstract</h2>
 </center>
  This paper describes a case study focused on redesigning procurement processes
 for research grants management at the U.S. Office of Naval Research. These
 processes focus on the procurement of R&amp;D services, and how they can
be redesigned and supported using Web-based capabilities. Through the application
 of empirical results and theoretical concepts from business process reengineering,
 electronic commerce, and IT-based process management, we gain insight into
 issues and challenges to be addressed in redesigning the procurement of
contracted services with Web-based EC capabilities. Accordingly, four research
questions are identified and addressed which build from these results and
concepts. Finally, in collaboration with other participants in this effort,
the case study reveals that we could contribute to a substantial reduction
in process cycle time and operational costs associated with the annual funding
of thousands of research grant procurement actions at ONR.  
<p><b><i><font face="Arial">1. Introduction</font></i></b> </p>
 
<p>Anecdotal evidence from recent efforts to deploy Web-enabled procurement
 at companies such as AMD and<b> </b>Boehringer Ingelheim Corp., indicates
 that such moves create "a massive reengineering challenge" [27, quoted in 
the original]. Why is this so? Why can't organizations simply purchase and 
install an off-the-shelf software package that supports procurement functions 
that use the Internet without encountering a massive reengineering challenge? 
Is the experience at organizations like AMD simply anomalous, or are they 
likely to be typical of other organizations following a similar path? Are 
the challenges any greater, lesser or just different if we address the procurement 
of contracted services instead of the procurement of supplies for maintenance, 
repair and operations? </p>
 
<p>The purpose of this paper is to explore four research questions that follow 
from these simple inquiries through an action research case study performed 
at the Office of Naval Research. The ONR study focussed on reengineering
the procurement of contracted research services. The procurement of contracted
 services is a topic that has not appeared in previous studies of Web-based
 electronic commerce [cf. 8, 9, 14, 26, 32]. As such, the first question
addresses, <i>how is the procurement of contracted services in an organization
like ONR similar to, or different from, other common procurement activities.</i>
  The second question examines, <i>what is involved in reengineering the
processes for procurement of contracted services</i>. The third research
question investigates, <i>how can information technologies for Web-based
process management play a role in facilitating the reengineering of contracted
service procurement</i> . Finally, the fourth question identifies <i>what
kinds of challenges can make the transition to Web-based procurement processes
problematic, and how can these challenges be resolved</i>. Background discussion
and related research in Section 2 on business process reengineering (BPR),
electronic commerce (EC) and information technology (IT) for process management
can be used to formulate initial answers to these questions. However, developing
grounded answers to these questions requires an empirical investigation.
This is the purpose of the case study at ONR found in Section 3. </p>
 
<p>The paper describes an approach, technology, and case study for understanding,
 redesigning and transforming procurement processes and information work
environment for a complex, multi-site organization. It begins with a background
that characterizes what must be understood in order to redesign and transform
the procurement of services, specifically R&amp;D services supported by contracts 
and grants from ONR. The next section provides an overview of related research 
used in the case study that follows. Through the ONR case study, six challenges 
for what's involved in understanding, redesigning and transforming procurement 
processes to utilize Web-based EC capabilities are identified and addressed. 
A discussion of these challenges and the consequence of their resolution at
ONR follows. Finally, the conclusions reexamine the four research questions 
that motivate this study. </p>
 
<p>Through this effort, a dramatic reduction in the cycle time by a factor
 of 20 was achieved, while operational cost savings worth $10M-$15M per year 
were identified and mobilized. The case study thus serves to explain how these
results were accomplished by overcoming challenges in place at ONR.  </p>
 
<p><b><i><font face="Arial">2. Understanding service procurement and how
to reengineer it</font></i></b> </p>
 
<p>Procurement typically refers to organizational activities associated with 
the purchase of raw materials and production goods, supplies for maintenance,
 repair and operations (MRO), as well as for capital goods. Materials, supplies
 and production goods are generally items that can be found and described
in catalogs, then purchased in quantity units per transaction. The procurement
 of items like these is a focus of research and practice for how EC may be 
applied in organizations through Internet-based procurement processes [3, 
8, 9, 14, 27]. Nonetheless, many organizations also procure <i>contracted
 services </i>of one kind or another. Services may or may not result in the 
delivery of materials, supplies or goods. Services instead may provide new, 
enhanced, or sustaining capabilities to an organization. </p>
 
<p>R&amp;D service contracts (including research grants) often expend amounts
 between $10K-$10M per year. At ONR, the average expense for a research contract 
is about $100K per year. As a result, fulfillment of contracted services procurement
usually takes months or years to complete. Similarly, due to the high cost,
governance and management controls associated with service contracts of this
kind, the procurement of research service is usually not a single purchase
transaction. Instead, it is a sequence of incremental procurement actions
over the course of a contract. Long duration contract service procurements, 
such as a research grant, give rise to many short-term procurement actions. 
Subsequently, the structure and workflow of short-term service transactions 
in the context of a long-term fulfillment become the focus of what must be 
redesigned and transformed in order to utilize Internet or Web-based EC systems 
associated with the procurement of contracted services. </p>
 
<p><b>2.1 Understanding the procurement of contracted services</b> </p>
 
<p>The authorization and obligation of start-up or incremental funding are 
common actions when procuring contracted services. Such actions obligate
funds and designate budget line items in the corporate treasury to be charged,
which in turn are exposed for expenditure draws, subject to various corporate
accounting policies and auditing controls. Invoices submitted by service
providers can then be paid, for instance via Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT).
Progress payments to pay for incremental or ongoing services are made until
the funding authorization is exhausted, changed or rescinded, subject to
other terms and conditions stipulated and agreed to in the contract. In order
to redesign the processes for procuring services such as R&amp;D, details
such as these point to the control logic, pre- and post-conditions (i.e.,
business rules) associated with different procurement process steps or workflow
actions. Similarly, these details begin to identify the types of information
entities that procurement participants may need to access, update or manipulate
through an Internet-based user interface to underlying EC applications. Examples 
of these details are presented later. </p>
 
<h3> 2.2 How is service procurement at ONR the same/different than other government
organizations or commercial enterprises?</h3>
  ONR's procurement activities are focused on the <i>acquisition of science
 and technology R&amp;D services. </i>It acquires these services from a few 
thousand academic, non-profit and for-profit institutions to support the research
agenda of the U.S. Navy. The providers of research services are distributed
throughout the U.S., but a small number of providers are based in settings
in Europe, Japan, and elsewhere. ONR also acts as a research funding intermediary
(or "contract manager") for other Government agencies that do not or may
not be able to manage R&amp;D service procurements. ONR acquires research
services using contracts, grants (i.e., limited contracts), and other agreements.
Subsequently, during the 1990's, ONR procured research services through grants
totaling between $500M-$2B/year via 4000-8000 procurement actions (process
instances) per year. Thus, at this point, ONR is similar to other large organizations
in the amount of money spent through procurements. ONR also serves a similar
purpose within the Government as other research funding agencies (NSF, HHS,
DOE, NASA, etc.) focused on the acquisition of R&amp;D services. However,
ONR chose not to automate existing processes for grant management, in contrast
to the NSF FastLane system that automated its existing research grant proposal
submission and review process in 1996-98 (cf. http://www.fastlane.nsf.gov).
 
<p>Acquiring R&amp;D services is big business. The acquisition of R&amp;D
 services represents a substantial area of procurement actions and expenditures
 within the U.S. Government, with total U.S. Government outlays for R&amp;D
 services in 1998 exceeding $70B [25]. Understanding how procurement processes
 at ONR may be redesigned to use Internet-based EC capabilities may shed
light on how it may be applied in similar research acquisition settings.
Thus, a substantial opportunity exists for exploring how Internet-based EC
can be applied to support the acquisition and procurement of R&amp;D services. 
However, things may be different in the private sector. </p>
 
<p>Few corporations, if any, acquire scientific research services from external 
sources at the total dollar level or total number of procurement actions compared
to ONR or similar Government agencies. Nonetheless, a large portion of corporations
and non-research oriented Government departments frequently acquire contracted
services of various kinds (E.g., consulting, engineering, and facilities
management) from external providers. These acquisitions may come in the form
of service contracts, sub-contracts, or other outsourcing arrangements. Thus,
this study can help highlight issues and challenges that can arise when a
large organization seeks to redesign its procurement processes for contracted
services to take advantage on Internet-based EC capabilities. A foundation
for these capabilities now follows. </p>
 
<p>Two areas of related research bear on this study. These are business process 
reengineering and EC. Each is addressed in turn, though the results cited 
will be framed in terms of their application for procurement processes. Also, 
the process-driven IT employed in this study is introduced and described.
 </p>
 
<p><b>2.3 How to reengineer business processes like procurement?</b> </p>
 
<p>Following the work of Hammer, Davenport and their colleagues, existing
 as-is procurement processes should be either obliterated rather than automated
 [13], or else understood and measured [5]. Accordingly, innovative to-be
procurement processes should be prototyped using leading-edge IT as a new
foundation for coordinating research grants management activities [5]. However,
the ability to successfully realize the benefits of radical IT-based changes 
in most business processes has been elusive. </p>
 
<p>Reflective studies of the problems, pitfalls and best practices of BPR
 find that certain organizational variables, rather than IT, are key to achieving 
successful BPR outcomes [1, 12]. In many of the BPR projects examined, BPR 
failure was reported to be the outcome about 70% of the time [1]. How can 
BPR failure be avoided when redesigning procurement processes? Available research
results indicate that critical conditions to help realize successful BPR
should include the participation and commitment of top management executives, 
empowered workers, shared vision, realistic expectations, changes in worker 
roles and responsibilities, new performance measurements, worker incentives, 
and the like [1, 12]. Conversely if these organizational conditions are insignificant 
or missing, then we should expect the application of BPR to processes like 
procurement to fail. </p>
 
<p>The dilemma of how to realize the benefits of a successful BPR project,
 while avoiding the likelihood of failure, gave rise to a series of empirical
 field studies and surveys to track down the source of variation and causality.
 Results from representative investigations [2, 6, 10] emphasized the importance
 of addressing BPR implementation within the broader context of organizational
 change in a complex socio-technical environment [cf. 17]. For instance,
some organizations may choose to reengineer a set of processes over time,
in order to learn from what succeeds and what fails [2]. Applying a lesson
learned from Caron and colleagues [2] to procurement reveals that BPR efforts
should be implemented bottom-up by the process end-users, rather than imposed
top-down by senior management [cf. 13], to succeed. Following this, senior
management should provide the strategic vision for an effort to redesign
processes, such as procurement, that empowers process staff to participate
in directing and implementing the effort [6]. Similarly, change management
strategies and techniques, technological competence, tactical planning and
project management, and training personnel for to-be processes, should be
factors related to success when redesigning procurement processes [10]. Subsequently,
drawing from the emerging theoretical basis of BPR [15], when redesigning
procurement processes, focus should be on the creation of an organizational
environment that supports change management strategies, learning, knowledge
sharing supplemented with IT, internal and external partnering, and measurable
process improvements, as prerequisites for BPR success. </p>
 
<p>Finally, recent studies of BPR establish ties between process change and 
their consequence on organizational performance. For example, applying the 
results of Guha and colleagues [11], reengineering procurement processes
should require the creation of a learning organization where the interdependencies
 between the change environment, process management and change management.
 Following [30], when redesigning procurement processes, management controls
 of organizational resources, such as procurement expenditures, must remain
 effective though perhaps in a more streamlined manner. </p>
 
<p><b>2.4 How is Electronic Commerce Research Related to Procurement Processes?</b>
  </p>
 
<p>Procurement has been identified as one of the key areas for the application
 and integration of EC tools and techniques [14]. However, the relationship
 seems to primarily emphasize the use of EC to support the procurement of
MRO commodities, supplies or goods, rather than contracted services. How
to best support contracting, contract management, and negotiation in the
context of EC is seen as a topic for future research [24], yet procurement
contract management processes are central to this study. Emerging theory
on EC points to the need to understand business processes in terms of the
interdependencies of variables such as business partnering arrangements [26],
networked IT infrastructure design [31], and transaction (governance) costs
[32]. Thus, we should assume these interdependencies can arise in the context
of applying EC technologies and techniques to contracted service procurement,
and so they should be investigated. </p>
 
<p><b>2.5 Redesigning Procurement Processes with IT for Process Management</b>
  </p>
 
<p>Research results in BPR draw attention to the need to focus on change
management and process management. Change management draws attention to understanding 
and transforming work activities, the organizational setting and the ways 
participants act towards both. For process management, we choose to understand, 
analyze, and engineer complex organizational processes using process-driven 
intranets (PDIs) supported by a knowledge-based systems approach [19, 23, 
28, 29]. The PDI and underlying technology developed at the USC ATRIUM Laboratory 
in the mid-1990's (and possibly appearing somewhat dated) are not the focus 
of this paper, but they are described elsewhere [23, 29]. Instead, attention 
is directed at the approach taken for process management, and the role the 
PDI played in supporting this approach. </p>
 
<p>The incremental specification and system-based interpretation of business
 process representations is central to this approach. Such representations
 can be designated as <i>organizational process architectures</i> (OPAs).
An OPA denotes a structured, software-based representation of the object,
attributes, relations, methods and constraints. These representations collectively
define and link the structure and flow of work processes within an organizational
 and technological context [29, 22]. Such a computational representation
is more than a graphical workflow specification; it is instead an <i>ontology
 </i>that specifies the structure and definition of relationships between 
objects denoting who does what, where, when, why and how in the course of 
enacting work processes. Description of the ontology is found elsewhere [19, 
28]. Using such an ontology, OPAs can be formalized as knowledge representations
 (semantic networks) that model the web of processes, products, people (roles
 and workgroups), information infrastructure, and tools central to an organization
 in its routine and ad hoc work operations [17, 19, 28, 29]. Highlights of 
the activities associated with development of OPAs now follow, since their 
details appear elsewhere [28, 29]. </p>
 
<p>In simplest terms, support for understanding and redesigning business
processes entails the development of OPAs through knowledge-based engineering
of the<i>  process life cycle</i> [28, 29]. PLC engineering is a technique
for process management [4], rather than a BPR methodology practiced by industry
consultants [16]. Process management subsumes common BPR activities such
as process modeling, visualization, analysis, simulation, redesign and prototyping.
Our approach to process management adds support for these capabilities across
multi-partner (virtual) enterprises and multiple settings [23]. Similarly,
it adds Internet-based IT mechanisms for integrating multiple distributed
processes, automated process-driven IT environment generation, semi-automated
process enactment, automated enactment monitoring and history capture (plus
replay), recovery from process enactment failures, and process asset management,
as part of its life cycle [23, 28, 29]. None of these capabilities are specific
to procurement processes, and thus these capabilities can be used to support
any organizational process whose OPA can be formally modeled following our
approach. However, these capabilities provide an Internet-based IT infrastructure
to rapidly configure, prototype and instantiate a PDI that can serve as a
<i>collaboratory for process reengineering </i>[cf. 18]. Such a PDI provided
a computer-supported learning environment where personnel from multiple ONR
sites could share and participate off-/on-site with USC researchers to incrementally
elicit, visualize, prototype, refine and integrate organizational processes,
using tools and OPAs accessed over the Internet [22, 23, 28, 29]. These were
new capabilities previously not used in BPR projects (in 1996-97), though
they have been used in other domains [19, 22, 29]. Furthermore, existing
tools for redesigning or implementing procurement processes generally lack
these capabilities [cf. 3, 5, 14, 27]. Subsequently, our choice was to use
this approach to process management to support the BPR of contracted procurement 
processes by a research team partnered with process end-users. </p>
 
<h2> <i><font face="Arial">3. Case Study: Reengineering research service procurement
at ONR</font></i></h2>
  ONR conducts its commerce through thousands of procurement actions per
year. These provide initial or incremental funding to pay for the salaries,
expenses and other costs incurred by the research service providers. In return,
ONR receives products from the research projects it funds in the form of
technical reports, research publications, system prototypes, presentation
briefings, and so forth.  
<p>In this case study, the BPR focus was directed at the set of four processes
 of ONR's research acquisition activity:<i> Pre-Award</i> (proposal solicitation
 [20] and review), <i>Award</i> (funding decision and obligation), <i>Administration</i>
  (funds disbursement and field office operations), and <i>Close-out</i>
(funding completion, reconciliation, and reporting compliance). These four
interrelated processes consisted of about 150 as-is process steps (i.e.,
problem-solving tasks) at ONR, representing up to four levels of process
decomposition and supervision. Five regional offices support ONR across the
U.S. to facilitate or perform these processes. Thus inputs, outputs or refinements
to/from the activities involved in the reengineering effort had to be accessible
in locations across the U.S. The choice made was to utilize a collaborative
Internet-based information infrastructure for process redesign developed
to address this need [29]. Accordingly, collective effort was focused on
learning and demonstrating how process life cycle activities could access,
support, and deliver procurement processes at ONR offices over the Internet
using a PDI and EC service transactions. Examples will be highlighted along
the way. </p>
 
<p>As part of this study, ONR wanted to adopt a corporate-wide intranet to 
support its internal processes throughout its offices associated with funding 
and tracking of research contracts and grants. This intranet was envisioned 
by senior management at ONR to eventually use EC tools and techniques, in 
line with emerging Government EC initiatives [7]. Senior management's long-term 
goal at ONR was to evolve this intranet to integrate and support EDI for research
grant paperwork submissions, EFT for funds distribution, and various information
repositories to organize, broker, track, evaluate, and report on funded R&amp;D
project activities. Nonetheless, the existing IT-based systems at ONR operated
mainly as independent systems. </p>
 
<p><b>3.1 Challenges in redesigning ONR procurement processes for Internet-based
 EC</b> </p>
 
<p>Understanding and modeling the situation at hand was the first goal [5]. 
Through a series of meetings and initial process elicitation, we came to discover
a number of challenging problems had to be addressed in redesigning  ONR's
acquisition processes to eventually accommodate a multi-site corporate  intranet.
Six such problems became apparent: </p>
 
<p><i>Personnel at ONR were unfamiliar with the concepts, techniques, and
 tools for understanding and redesigning their work processes</i>. This seems 
true of organizations that have not undertaken a process redesign effort [1].
Thus, we could not expect that ONR personnel could readily describe or articulate
high fidelity specifications of their work processes and arrangements, though
they work within them on a daily basis. Most of their knowledge of these
routine processes had become tacit. Thus we and they had to collectively educate
and share with each other how these processes operate, the operational problems
arising during these processes, and how these processes might be changed
and streamlined [15]. </p>
 
<p><i>ONR had a heterogeneous computing infrastructure and isolated information
 systems that often made information sharing problematic. </i>ONR possessed
 the basic compliment of Internet-based systems and infrastructure needed
to conduct EC. These systems included TCP/IP LANs with Internet connectivity,
 secure web server and web browsers installed on desktop PCs. ONR also employed
 a database system for managing procurement actions, a second database system
 used by field offices for contract and grant administration, and a third
database system outside of ONR under the control of the U.S. Dept. of Defense
Comptroller for tracking ONR's expended funds. In addition, ONR employs an
experimental EDI testbed, and various data analysis and management reporting
utilities. However, all these capabilities existed as distinct stand-alone
systems. ONR stipulated that these legacy systems could not be thrown out
or bypassed. Instead, they must be incorporated into proposed redesign alternatives.
Implementing an intranet thus would require bridging and integrating these
heterogeneous "islands of automation" [22]. </p>
 
<p><i>There was recurring difficulty in efficiently managing and tracking
 research grants funding expenditures</i>. The management of contract service
 expenditures was not a routine everyday activity at ONR, compared to the
four research acquisition processes. Instead, it was an ad hoc, on-demand
process to gather, summarize and report data on the status of overall procurement
 funds from different financial databases accessed or maintained by ONR.
Demand for expenditure management updates could be triggered by programmatic
changes in budget authorization or unexpected budget shortfalls/surpluses.
However, relevant data was located in different information systems or personal
information spaces. Elements of this information were said to be inconsistent,
depending on whose "numbers" staff could access and when. </p>
 
<p><i>There was a lack of trust and lack of data integrity controls in existing 
data sets</i>. This gave rise to problems higher up in the organization since 
decision-makers need timely access to current budget totals for procurement
 funds obligated, encumbered, and expended across different categories and
 research programs [cf. 30]. </p>
 
<p><i>There was limited visibility and slow response to external customer
 inquiries (from outside agencies using ONR research grants management services)
 on the status of pending funding actions for research proposal grants to
be awarded.</i> Untimely delays or inconsistent data could lead to loss of
obligation authority for funding contract procurements inside ONR or its
funding partners (e.g., DARPA), due to Federal budgeting process constraints
and DoD financial controls. These constraints and controls had to be maintained,
while conformance to them needed to be streamlined [cf. 30]. </p>
 
<p><i>Can all of the five preceding challenges be concurrently address via 
an approach to process management that incorporates organizational transformation, 
process redesign and Internet-based systems integration</i>? The basic issue 
here is to avoid development of an ad hoc, piece-meal, or point solution to
each of the preceding challenges, and instead pursue a collaborative, comprehensive
and integrated solution. </p>
 
<p>Subsequently, this set of challenges suggests that redesigning research
 service procurement at ONR would be a major undertaking [cf. 27]. </p>
 
<p><b>3.2 Addressing the challenges</b> </p>
 
<p>The USC research team came to the view that the preceding problems were
 interrelated. Thus, the solutions to these problems should also be related.
 For example, data integrity problems were assigned a top priority by ONR
senior management for action. Subsequently, process redesign would need to
provide upstream data quality checks to minimize the likelihood of getting
inconsistent data into the systems [12, 30]. One goal of process redesign
would need to address how to make sure that people who were most interested
in getting correct data input to a process were enabled and self-motivated
to do so. For instance, the principal investigator or institution that submits
a research proposal to ONR should be capable and well-motivated to correctly
enter data pertaining to their proposed budget, schedule of deliverables,
and surface or electronic mail addresses for receiving payments. However,
this was a to-be vision. In the as-is condition, different ONR staff would
re-enter such data in various procurement steps, in different organizational
locations, in different formats into different information systems. This
adds no value to the data, but instead increases the likelihood of error,
data inconsistency, process workarounds, and subsequent processing delays.
Providing Web-based input forms and corresponding ONR server-side database
entry routines could support such a redesign [5, 13]. This in turn could
eliminate some of the existing as-is process pathologies that compromise
data integrity. </p>
 
<p>Subsequently, the process redesign team found the other challenges could
 be resolved through a series of solution steps that bring people, processes,
 work products, and extant information system technologies into alignment.
 A description of these steps now follows. </p>
 
<h4> <i>Step 1: Facilitate collaborative understanding, redesign and transformation
 of ONR processes.</i></h4>
  Procurement is traditionally viewed as a back office business activity
concerned with purchasing, corporate financial operations, expenditure management, 
and status reporting [7, 8, 14]. At ONR, it is also an activity governed by
a large number of changing acquisition regulations and policies at Federal, 
DoD, and Navy levels. Federal Acquisition Regulations (FARs) apply to all 
government agencies, including those involved in procuring R&amp;D services 
through contracts and grants. Conditions and constraints stipulated in the 
FARs ultimately prescribed how different kinds of procurement actions will 
be processed. Nonetheless, the processes and artifacts used to manage development 
contracts are essentially the same as those used to manage research grants. 
In addition, the ONR personnel who administer grant awards from ONR's five 
field offices across the U.S. are the same people who manage contract fulfillment 
obligations, as well as FAR compliance and reporting requirements at institutions 
receiving research funding. Thus, the domain of acquisition and procurement 
of research service contracts for Federal agencies is highly tractable and 
sufficiently structured to enable successful understanding of the as-is and 
to-be OPA [5].  
<p>Procurement organizations are populated with personnel that are usually
 not specialists with advanced information technology. They cannot be expected
 to already be familiar with a wide range of intranet tools or EC concepts.
 This was true at ONR. Furthermore, they might resist the intervention by
"outsiders" whose purpose may be perceived as eliminating their jobs or reducing
their administrative autonomy through a process redesign effort [cf. 1, 2].
Nonetheless, ONR like other government agencies is under substantial pressure
to accept increasing workloads, improve organizational efficiency and effectiveness, 
and reduce operational costs, all within shrinking operating budgets. </p>
 
<p>Understanding the as-is and to-be OPA of research procurement processes
 at ONR benefited from the involvement, participation, and intellectual engagement 
of personnel from the top to the bottom of the ONR organization [1, 15]. The
USC researchers needed to educate ONR personnel on our motives, methods and
capabilities; ONR needed to help us learn about the generic, circumstantial, 
and problematic variants of their work processes and information flow [10, 
11]. Two or three iterations of process elicitation, analysis, visualization 
and redesign refinements were typically performed, particularly with key process
end-users, process owners or subject-matter experts. Follow-up validations 
and refinements by other personnel not necessarily involved in earlier iterations 
were also performed. Furthermore, a shared vision and constraints were established 
early on between the research team and ONR personnel covering the following 
items [cf. 1, 6, 10, 15]: </p>
 
<ul>
  <li> the USC research team would identify opportunities for optimizing
the redesign of work processes, information flow and information integration 
(see Table 1 for examples);</li>
   <li> effort would be directed at improving personnel effectiveness and 
workflow without increasing anyone's workload--personnel had to be more satisfied
 with the new redesigned work arrangements than with the status quo;</li>
   <li> no new personnel positions would be created or added, but responsibilities
 could change;</li>
   <li> four ONR acquisition processes examined would be developed in three 
forms: as-is (legacy form), to-be (alternative process architecture), and 
here-to-there transition forms (steps taken in 30 day increments to progressively 
transform the organizational work patterns and processes from the as-is to 
to-be forms--see Table 2 for examples).</li>
   <li> all intermediate and in-progress results would be posted on the USC 
ATRIUM web site, so ONR personnel could access this information over the Web
at their discretion, and provide questions or feedback via email, telephone
 or face-to-face meetings;</li>
   <li> ONR personnel would make final decisions on the selection, prioritization
 and schedule of process redesign alternatives to be implemented;</li>
   <li> any process improvements to be implemented had to be self-motivating 
or enable local organizational incentives to increase the likelihood of their
 successful implementation and routinization.</li>
   
</ul>
  Because of these efforts and shared agreements, there was little or no
resistance among the participating staff. Instead, participants indicated
they felt empowered and intellectually engaged in the organizational transformation.
 The overall process redesign effort was defined and structured as inherently
 collaborative in purpose, method, and outcome. Subsequently, the commitments
 and actions of ONR's participants to transform and sustain their OPAs would
 determine the ultimate success of this process redesign effort.  
<p>One key aspect of the collaborative strategy for redesigning procurement
 processes at ONR was the ability to identify multiple alternatives for how 
the process structure or flow could be streamlined. Accordingly, the USC researchers
identified ten possible process redesign options that could be applied in
different parts of the procurement process at ONR. Table 1 presents these
in the following manner. The first column identifies the "process diagnostics" 
that characterize some part of the as-is procurement processes at ONR, derived 
from measurements on the OPA [27]. The second column identifies the corresponding 
redesign opportunities [12] or "process redesign heuristics" [29] that seek 
to resolve the problems associated with a process diagnostic [20, 21]. The 
final column represents a collective, subjective assessment by the USC and 
ONR process redesign team for the expected return on investment if ONR were 
to provide the resources required to successfully implement the corresponding 
redesign heuristic. No robust cost analysis or attendant effort to collect 
cost data was performed. Nonetheless, ONR decision-makers were comfortable 
with such an assessment, given the openness of the process redesign and assessment 
activity, discussion and perceived outcomes [1]. </p>

<p><a name="Table1"></a><b><font size="-1">Table 1</font>: Process redesign
 heuristics applicable for ONR's R&amp;D service procurement</b></p>
 </center>
    
<p>As may be apparent from Table 1, multiple overlapping process redesign
 alternatives exist, but with varying perceived returns. Most of the redesign
 heuristics point to a new information infrastructure for procurement that
 manages new or existing information entities with new/legacy tools or process
 automation capabilities that could be integrated with Internet-based technologies.
 But to do so would require making many changes in how procurement processes
 work at ONR. The USC researchers were responsible for proposing process
redesigns, then prototyping and demonstrating the resulting information infrastructure 
for the redesigned procurement processes. These results could be turned over 
to one or more commercial IT service contractors ONR uses for final implementation 
and ongoing production support. ONR personnel were then responsible for choosing 
which process redesigns to pursue, resource and implement. In the end, ONR 
personnel selected all but one of the redesign alternatives, with the exception 
being the rule-based contract document builder. </p>
 
<p>ONR needed to implement the proposed changes from the as-is to to-be forms 
of the procurement processes and information infrastructure. The process redesign
team in conjunction with many others at ONR then developed and refined a
here-to-there transition plan which relevant ONR personnel had to approve 
and commit the necessary resources. Table 2 provides a sample from the 25 
transition steps that characterize the priority and level of resources/effort 
needed to incrementally make the requisite transitions from as-is to to-be 
procurement processes. <br>

<h4> <i>Step 2: Iteratively prototype, demonstrate and refine a PDI for ONR
 procurement processes.</i></h4>
  The development and technology of PDIs are not the focus of this paper.
But what is important to know about PDIs is that they can be used to collaboratively
 and incrementally specify, visualize, prototype and automate the enactment
 of complex business processes with Web-based mechanisms, using an OPA as
input. The OPA can be specified incrementally, or as you proceed, in a process
modeling language which serves as input to a PDI compiler that instantiates
a distributed process enactment web [23, 29]. This means that the USC researchers
could represent and model as-is and to-be procurement processes that were
being iteratively investigated and refined by ONR personnel. Following each
iteration, a Web-based prototype that provides authorized users navigational
views of their work processes through a Web browser would be generated, together
with links to associated applications and data. The following figures provide 
a brief glimpse of user interface displays from the PDI designed and generated 
by USC researchers for ONR procurement processes. By themselves, these displays 
may convey little of the procurement processes, since the total set of process 
steps in the four redesigned processes now numbers in the dozens (from about 
150 to less than 40). However, most users of these processes only see a small 
subset of the steps and corresponding user interfaces specified for their 
user-role (contract administrator, grants specialist, program officer, research 
investigator, etc.).  
<p>Figure 1 shows one example step (in a then current Netscape 1.2 browser
 window in 1996) within procurement processes at ONR. This step is part of 
the Pre-Award process, whereby a research investigator (a user role) submits 
a proposal to ONR for funding consideration. As part of this step, the investigator 
enters data needed by ONR for logging and tracking subsequent actions pertaining 
to the submitted proposal. This includes identifying the proposal file to 
be submitted for upload or transfer to ONR. When the user satisfactorily enters
the requested data, the transfer is initiated by selecting the "Done" button.
After this, the user can then select the "Next Task" from a list of those
ready to be performed. Although not shown, it is a similar step whereby the
investigator submits an electronic budget form that accompanies the proposal
submission. Finally, the frame in the bottom right that displays the history
of steps done as a way of recording the in-progress status of each cycle
through the process. In this way, multiple concurrent process instances (i.e.,
procurement action requests in progress) may be active in different steps
at any time. Users can select the one the wish to work on by selecting from
the "available tasks" (not shown here) form maintained in a repository for
user-role, process-instance status. Depending on auditing requirements, other
attributes indicating the date and time of step completion, PC network (IP)
address, etc. can be recorded and later replayed or analyzed for process
improvement opportunities. </p>

 </center>
    
<p>Figure 2 displays the resulting proposal object attribute values that
are uploaded from the user client to the ONR database. This view simply provides 
the user with a validation of data submitted, and requires no further action 
on the part of the user, unless they recognize an error in their data entry 
[cf. 12]. Nonetheless, the data that is posted can be automatically entered 
into a logging procedure for proposals submitted to update pending procurement 
actions in the ONR corporate procurement database. This information can similarly 
be used to automate the notification of proposal received to relevant ONR 
divisions as well, as required in one of the transition steps noted in Table 
2. Server-side resources control repositories for executable process representations, 
user role access, and database transactions. Other procurement process steps 
may also use client-side "helper application" tools for editing data forms/records,
 preparing correspondence or presentation reporting materials, calculating
 spreadsheet functions, and database query and update transaction forms.
The multi-level scheme used for integrating different kinds of tools, data
or legacy applications into a PDI, and the overall system architecture of
a PDI are described elsewhere [22, 23]. </p>
 
<p>Last, PDIs provide additional forms of security through fine-grain access
 control [cf. 3, 14, 30]. Specifically, when users access information through
 a PDI, they do so by first establishing their user-id, password, and process
 role. In a process involving many people performing in different roles,
the PDI can provide role-specific access to only those parts of the process
that a registered user in a designated role requires in order to complete
their work. In this way, access to information can be specified and controlled
by user-id, user group-id, assigned role or process step. As a person might
also have multiple roles in different processes, then access control can
be assigned in a corresponding manner. Similarly, access control can be further
specified by process step, since traversal of each process step in a PDI
constitutes an event or process transaction that can have pre-condition guards,
post-condition triggers or other business rules assigned to them [cf. 23].
Fine-grain access controls such as these are now, in 1999, widespread on
Internet-based EC sites and applications. </p>
 
<h4> <i>Step 3: Facilitate the tactical challenges of expenditure management,
 data integrity, external customer queries through Internet-based systems
integration.</i></h4>
  A recurring problem in the conduct of ONR's commerce was <i>expenditure
management</i> : determining how much unallocated research funds are available
for new procurement obligations, and how much has been actually encumbered
(invoiced) or expended (disbursed). From a financial control standpoint,
disbursements represent an outward flow of funds, invoices represent bills
submitted by service providers for payment (but subject to approval under
FARs), while obligations represent budget allocations that can be altered
at any time. If procurement action lead time (PALT) measurements exhibit
cycle times measured in months or weeks, then uncertainty, misunderstanding,
and organizational inefficiency can occur relative to the status of funds
availability. For instance, if ONR disburses $1B/yr. for research procurements,
then on average it disburses about $20M/week. If PALT processing takes 6-10
weeks, then the budget status of well over $100M may be in question, resulting
in uncertainty and further delay in processing subsequent research procurement
requests. Reducing PALTs to days (or even to hours!) can mitigate these dilemmas.
 
<p>At ONR, expenditure management was complicated by the fact that the requisite 
information was distributed across three distinct information systems and 
across the four research acquisition processes. Each such system had its own
administrative authority, organizational location, database, data model, and
data format. Subsequently, as-is expenditure management reports and briefings 
for ONR senior management had to be constructed on an ad hoc basis. This often
required manually transcribing procurement expenditure data into PC-based 
spreadsheets, which in turn were summarized and incorporated into presentation 
materials (i.e., MS PowerPoint slides). The temporal relevancy of this data 
was often 3-6 weeks old, whereas $500K to $3M or more might be expended on 
a workday. Thus, a timely, less cumbersome solution was needed for expenditure 
management. A view of the proposed solution can now be described. </p>
 
<p>In Table 3, each of the three rightmost columns represents data managed
 by a separate database management system and administrative authority. Integrating 
these heterogeneous databases into a single global database would be an expensive 
and time-consuming proposition. Therefore this was not a redesign option. 
Instead, the USC researchers proposed a networked form-based script that provides
read-only views through a purpose-built data cache that periodically queries,
downloads, reformats, and sorts (using Award and Request Numbers as indices)
the funding data from each database. Table 3 shows a representative view
integration, although other ONR or provider-specific information is not shown.
In addition, ONR's external customers (E.g., Program Managers at DARPA) could
query-access this data through their role-specific views and Award numbers
from a Web-based PDI user interface in their offices. </p>

<p><b>Table 3</b><font size="-1">: </font>A proposed integrated view of ONR
 funds across procurement expenditure processes</p>
 </center>
    
<p>ONR personnel indicated on-demand access to an integrated view of funding
 actions over an intranet would address critical decision-making needs in
ways not previously available. This meant stressful, ad hoc processes for
expenditure management could be eliminated. Similar integrated data views
could be created to display the dates associated with the performance of
specified procurement process steps. These would meet other status reporting
needs. Linking these tables with common PC tools like Microsoft Access, PowerPoint
and WordPerfect would then enable further automation and streamlining of
management report preparation, since the required reports and presentation
graphics could then be automatically produced within redesigned procurement
processes. While these changes propose adding new tools, user access roles
and process steps, together they improve the overall effectiveness of research
service procurement and grants management. Subsequently, being able to address
practical problems such as expenditure management, status reporting and external
customer queries may determine the eventual success in being able to apply
these results in other settings. </p>
 
<h2> <i><font face="Arial">4. Results and Discussion</font></i></h2>
  This case study reveals six challenges in redesigning and transforming
procurement processes at ONR to realize Internet-based EC capabilities. Three
solution steps were identified to address and resolve the challenges. Surprisingly, 
none of these challenges seem unique to the procurement of contracted services, 
procurement of R&amp;D, or procurement processes specific to a government 
organization. Instead, these challenges may be typical for mid-to-large organizations 
that want to redesign their procurement processes to exploit Internet-based 
EC capabilities [cf. 14, 26, 27, 32]. This requires further study to substantiate. 
Nonetheless, the solution steps are specific to the IT resources, organizational 
setting, OPA, and participants at ONR.  
<p>The relatively ease with which the approach and results reported here
can be replicated outside of ONR is a matter of opinion. However, this case
study conveys what was done, how it was accomplished, and how it might be
applied, reproduced or reused in other organizational settings. For example,
utilizing collaborative IT-based process management, the process redesign
heuristics outlined in the Table 1, and change management techniques, we
observed a substantial reduction in cycle time for PALT. PALT measurements
indicate the elapsed time at ONR from a research grant-funding obligation
to the time when the grant recipient can begin to expend their funding award.
As more than 5000 research procurement actions are performed per year at
ONR (1995-1997), a reduction of average PALT from 70 days in 1994-5, to 7-10
days in 1997, to 2-3 days in early 1999 represents a demonstration of successful
process reengineering and ongoing improvement at ONR. It also represents
what people working together can accomplish when they collaborate in efforts
that were specified to make their work practices more timely, more efficient,
and more effective through careful understanding and redesign of their OPA.
Other proposed transformations such as the adoption and internal distribution
of electronic research proposals, electronic budgets and associated procurement 
actions status tracking would save ONR $10M-$15M per year. Finally, the plan 
and steps for transitioning ONR to a PDI was developed by a collaborative 
process redesign team working using a process reengineering collaboratory 
mobilized for this effort. </p>
 
<p>The action research method and shared effort agreements were also key
enablers for achieving the results described here. Similarly, the OPA and
process life cycle tools, techniques, and concepts employed were a key enabler
[23, 28, 29]. Last, the capability to provide remote access to our research
technologies to external customers and internal users, such as personnel
at ONR Headquarters and at its five field offices across the U.S., was also
a key enabler helping to affect empowerment, distance learning, process redesign,
and change management.  </p>
 
<p>Finally, how do other alternatives to PDIs compare in addressing the challenges 
encountered at ONR? For example, the Zephyr System [9], and those from vendors 
such as Ariba Inc. or CommerceOne [27], can be considered a PDI for the procurement 
of non-commodity parts or MRO supplies, respectively. They differ from the 
PDI technology used in this study [23, 29] in that they are designed to specifically 
implement processes for routine procurement and EC. Similarly, none of these 
other systems were designed nor implemented as a distributed multi-site collaboratory 
[18]. The PDI technology from USC takes an OPA specification as input, then 
compiles it to automatically generate a PDI application corresponding to modeled
process. This PDI capability can be used to collaboratively model, visualize,
prototype, automate, or (re)engineer business processes of all kinds over
the Internet, whether or not the processes are related to routine or contracted
service procurement. In so doing, it then becomes possible to rapidly create
PDI collaboratories for different types of processes, that can integrate
different types of data, data repositories, legacy applications, control
and version management schemes, and multiple process instances [29]. Thus,
while the alternative systems may be successful and easy to adopt or use
in their targeted procurement processes, they would seem to be a poor fit
for the procurement processes for contracted services at ONR. </p>
 
<p>Beyond this, alternative systems may use XML based notations for specifying
 and exchanging procurement data formats as a technique for integrating disparate 
or heterogeneous systems. However, prior research has already revealed that 
integrating heterogeneous systems across wide-area networks requires multiple 
techniques for data, control flow, and process integration [22, 23, 28]. Similarly,
the technique used to address the expenditure management challenge at ONR
relies on computational methods (i.e., automated processes) to construct and
present an integrated view of data from multiple disparate databases. Markup
notations like HTML or XML serve to enable Web browsers (or other PC applications)
to display or present shared data. Subsequently, view integration is the
technical accomplishment that emulates heterogeneous systems integration, 
rather than the use of a data markup notation. Thus, at best techniques such 
as XML can simplify data exchange between heterogeneous systems, but they 
do not address the range of issues or mechanisms needed for systems integration.
 </p>
 
<p><b><i><font face="Arial">5. Conclusions</font></i></b> </p>
 
<p>Four questions motivated this research study. Each can now be reexamined
 in turn. </p>
 
<p>First, the procurement of contracted research services at ONR is different
 from the routine procurement of materials, supplies and goods in a many
ways. Contracted services are procured incrementally over periods of months
to year in the course of their completion, versus the quantity unit purchase
 transactions associated with routine procurements. PALTs are a key performance
 measure for contracted service procurement. ONR like other government agencies
 in the research service contract business are subject to Federal Acquisition
 Regulations which add process steps and problem-solving tasks that do not
 occur in commercial firms. Thus, procurement of contracted research services
 at ONR is sufficiently different than commercial packages targeted to support
 routine procurement activities over the Internet would not work without
modification, if that is possible. However, ONR is sufficiently like other
government research agencies in that understanding and redesigning its research
procurement processes may lead to solutions that can be reused in these agencies,
and thus contribute in some way to a more efficient federal government. </p>
 
<p>Second, reengineering the processes for procuring contracted research
services at ONR was precipitated by a combination of concepts from BPR and
EC together with IT-based process management tools. Nonetheless, the case
study also makes clear that reengineering projects must address the organizational
situation, the roles participants play in understanding as-is and to-be versions
of their procurement processes, and provide a transition path for how to
transform the situation, participants and processes. Off-the-shelf software
packages that facilitate procurement services over the Internet by themselves
will not provide such an understanding of what exists, what's desired, nor
how to get from here to there. Change management techniques, collaborative
learning environments (PDIs), and process management technologies can however
help.  </p>
 
<p>Third, new IT or Web-based systems for process management can play a significant 
role in facilitating the collaborative understanding, redesign and incremental 
transformation of procurement processes for contracted services. This appears 
especially true in an organization like ONR that has multiple field offices 
in geographically dispersed locations. Procurement processes for research 
services are enacted and spread across multiple sites, systems, and administrative 
units. Process-directed intranets represent an appealing choice for providing 
a wide-area information infrastructure that supports collaborative learning 
through shared process management activities. PDIs model and enact organizational 
process architectures. A knowledge-based systems approach to process life 
cycle engineering of an OPA provides a strategy for how to blend process management
activities together with change management and organizational learning techniques.
Such an approach differs from conventional EC system approaches where the
focus may be aimed primarily at providing only the computational functions
needed to conduct purchasing or procurement transactions. Thus, they may
not be open to the needs identified in the preceding two research questions
(e.g., ability to support FARs, support BPR change management and incremental
transformation techniques). </p>
 
<p>Last, six challenges were encountered at ONR that made the transition
to Web-based procurement processes problematic. However, these challenges
were specific to this case study, though they might also be found in other
settings. Nonetheless, resolving these problematic challenges required an
approach to reengineering ONR's processes for procuring contracted research
services that provided a coherent, integrated approach to organizational
change management and process management. This approach was based on related
research in BPR, EC and IT-based process life cycle engineering, that was
put into practice and grounded through a three step, collaborative action
research strategy. This approach proved successful in this case study at
ONR in giving rise to substantial reductions in the cycle time and operational
costs associated with the procurement of contracted research services. </p>
 
<p>Overall, the four research questions that motivated this paper provide
 a new conceptual framework for understanding problems like how to reengineer
 procurement processes for contracted services using Internet-based, EC technologies. 
What is clear from this study, however, is that these technologies alone do
not affect a solution strategy, nor do they cause the organizational transformations 
needed to transition new systems into productive operation. Instead, a more 
comprehensive approach that combines and balances organizational change management 
techniques with new Web-based process management technologies provides a promising
avenue for further research and practice in reengineering procurement processes.
