<H1><A NAME=SECTION00630000000000000000> Compiler Modes</A></H1>
<P>
The compiler has several modes of operation, each mode
generating code with different properties.
The operating mode is controlled by a set of global flags,
which may be modified at any time, even during the compilation
so that a part of the program is compiled in a different mode.
These flags and the associated modes are listed below.
<P>
<DL ><DT>
<DD> debug_compile
When this flag is <b> on</b>, the compiler generates code which can
be traced with the debugger.
This code can sometimes be significantly less efficient
than the untraceable one, and the generated code size
is always significantly larger.
To generate optimised code, this flag must be switched off.
To achieve this, the predicate
<PRE>:- nodbgcomp.
</PRE>
can also be called, and it also switches off the <b> variable_names</b>
flag.
<P>
<DT>
<DD> <b> occur_check</b>
<A NAME=922>&#160;</A>
When this flag is <b> on</b>, the compiled code will perform
the <i> occur check</i> if necessary.
This means that every time a variable will be unified
with a compound term that might already contain a reference
to this variable, the compound term will be scanned for this occurrence
and if it is found, the unification fails.
In this way, the creation of infinite (cyclic) terms is impossible
and thus the behaviour of the system is closer
to the first order logic theory.
Unifications with the occur check may sometimes be very slow,
and most Prolog programs do not need it, because
no cyclic terms are created.
Note that this flag must be set both at compile time and at runtime in order
to actually perform the checks.
<P>
<DT>
<DD> dfid_compile
<A NAME=926>&#160;</A>
When this flag is <b> on</b>, the compiler will generate code that
keeps track of the number of ancestors of the current goal,
which is used by the library <b> dfid</b> to execute
<A NAME=929>&#160;</A>
the <b> bounded depth-first search</b>, either as iterative deepening
or plain depth limiting.
<P>
<DT>
<DD> float_precision
This flag specifies if the compiler generates code for <tt> single</tt>
or <tt> double</tt> precision floating point arithmetic. It is recommended
not to mix code compiled in different modes, because single and double
precision numbers do not unify and therefore may cause unexpected failures.
<P>
<DT>
<DD> variable_names
<A NAME=935>&#160;</A>
<A NAME=tex2html258 HREF="http://www.ecrc.de/eclipse/eclipse.html"><b> ECLiPSe</b></A>
  can remember the source variable names of the input variables.
When this flag is <b> on</b>, the compiled predicates
will keep the names of the source variables and will display
them whenever the variables are printed.
In this case the usage of the global stack and code space is slightly higher
(to store the name), and the efficiency of the code is marginally lower.
<A NAME=937>&#160;</A>
Setting this flag to check_singletons has the same effect as <b> on</b>,
but additionally, the compiler will issue warnings about variables which occur
only once in a clause and whose names do not start with an underscore character.
<P>
<DT>
<DD> all_dynamic
When this flag is <b> on</b>, all procedures are compiled
as dynamic ones (and there is no equivalent <b> static/1</b>
declaration).
It can be used to port programs from older interpreters
which rely heavily on the fact that all predicates
in these interpreters were dynamic.
Another possible use is to switch it on at the beginning of a file
that contains many dynamic predicates and switch it off at its end.
<P>
<DT>
<DD> macro_expansion
This is in fact a parser flag, is enables or disables the macro transformation
(see Chapter <A HREF="node149.html#chapmacros"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ecrc.de/eclipse/new_icons//cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>) for the input source.
