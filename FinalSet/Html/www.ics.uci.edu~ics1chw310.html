<LI><A NAME="QQ1"><H2>What does W3 define?</H2></A>
<P>W3, or the World Wide Web stands for a variety of things.  
According to T. Berners-Lee, one of the things W3 stands 
for is the concept that one can retrieve an array of 
information which have references by which they could be 
retrieved.
<P>The World Wide Web also has an address system (URI) 
which is incorporated so that one has a listing of the 
references, although many different protocols exist.
<P>There is also a network protocol (HTTP) which gives the 
performance and features which are not otherwise 
available.  For a detailed definition of what HTTP is, 
<i>click</i> <A 
HREF="http://wombat.doc.ic.ac.uk/
?Hypertext+Transfer+Protocol"><b>Hypertext Transfer 
Protocol</b></A>.  
<P>The WEB also uses a markup language (HTML), which serves 
the purpose of transmitting basic things across the 
net.  For a more detailed definition of what HTML is, 
<i>click</i> <A

<LI><A NAME="QQ2"><H2>What are the two main 
types of Internet connections and what are 
the differences between the two?</H2> The two main 
types of Internet connections are <A 
HREF="http://wombat.doc.ic.ac.uk/?direct+connection"><b>direct</b></A>and indirect connections.  Both types use either modems or existing newtwork cards, and have a wide range of prices.
The main difference between the two is that with a 
direct connection, the computer acts as an individual 
node on the Internet.
<P>With a direct connection, the computer has its own 
<A HREF="http//wombat.doc.ic.ac.uk/?IP+address"><b>IP 
address</b></A>, and it can be established as a 
server for FTP, Gopher, News, or the W3. By doing 
this, you can use the software available to bring in 
mail to your own computer.  For programs such as 
Mosaic, one must use direct connections.
<P>Indirect connection, however, gives a disk space 
and access time on another computer.  The mail 
received and transfer files stays on that server.

<LI><A NAME="QQ3"><H2>What does the UCI College 
of Medicine have to offer?</H2></A> The UCI College

attracted internationally recognized researchers and
