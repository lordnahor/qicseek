BroadbandSports.com employs a very basic classification system, based on â€œsportsâ€? and just a few well-defined subcategories.  We believe a hybrid is the best approach, especially as we are dealing with a clear and generally narrower community, in which we have had lots of experience, both professionally and personally.

We also employ both a &quot;narrow&quot; and &quot;broad&quot; folksonomy, allowing both video contributors and the community at-large to tag content.

In this way, we address the problem of finding and adequately â€œdescribingâ€™ the contents and or â€œmeaningâ€? of video programming.]]></description>
