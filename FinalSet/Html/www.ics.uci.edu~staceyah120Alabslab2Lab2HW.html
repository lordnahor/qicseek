    You must <span style="text-decoration: underline;">type</span> your
    lab assignments and submit them through the EEE Dropbox tool. A
    dropbox will be set up for each of the four lab assignments. This
    lab assignment is due Wednesday, Oct. 30 by 5pm. You must include
    all relevant R code used to answer the questions.<br>
    <br>
    <b>In addition to the lab assignment below, if you did not attend
      discussion, you must do the in-class hands-on simulation <a

      your TA or the Stats 120A drop-slot in the wall across the hall

              <h3><b>The Monty Hall Problem</b></h3>
            </div>
            Consider again the Monty Hall problem described in this lab.
            <br>
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Write an R <i>function</i> to simulate one play of
                the Monty Hall game where you <i>do</i> decide to
                switch doors. The function should return TRUE (or 1) if
                you win the car and FALSE (or 0) if you do not win the
                car. Note that we are assuming if Monty has a choice of
                which door to open, he will choose one of the doors
                randomly (e.g., if he needs to choose between doors 2
                and 3, each door has an equal probability of being the
                one Monty chooses).<br>
              </li>
              <li>Use your R function from part a. inside a for loop to
                simulate 10,000 plays of the game. Calculate the
                empirical probability on winning the car when using the
                switching strategy (i.e., in what proportion of the
                10,000 games did you win the car?) <br>
              </li>
              <li>Does your simulation suggest that it is a better
                strategy to switch doors than to stick with your
                original choice? Explain.<br>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Hints</h3>
            <p><i>Disclaimer: These hints are for the way I envisioned
                the function, but there are many other correct ways to
                simulate playing the game.</i><br>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>When writing the R function to simulate one play of
                the game, you can assume without loss of generality that
                you initially choose door number 1. Then have the
                function randomly choose one of the three doors to have
                the car behind it. (That is, instead of thinking that
                the car, goat and goat are fixed and that you randomly
                choose a door, view the game as the chosen door is fixed
                and the car, goat and goat are randomly assigned to the
                three doors.)<br>
              </li>
              <li>You will use a sequence of "if" statements to decide
                which of doors 2 and 3 Monty opens (assuming you chose
                door 1).</li>
              <li>Remember that the logical operator "==" will check if
                two things are equal and will return a TRUE if they are,
                and a FALSE if they are not.</li>
              <li>You will again get plenty of use out of the "sample"
                function. If you don't remember how to use this
                function, type "?sample" to open the help file.<br>
              </li>
            </ul>
