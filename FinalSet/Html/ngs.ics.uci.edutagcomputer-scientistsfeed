				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A colleague of mine mentioned that I am listed in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_computer_scientists">List of Computer Scientists on Wikipedia</a>.  I visited the list and must say that I am honored and surprised.  Honored is obvious &#8212; and surprised is because I never took a class in computer science so was not formally trained in computer science, but more importantly, because this list (at this stage) is a relatively short list and finding my name in this list is truly surprising.  </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how these things happen &#8212; and did not even know about my name being on the list, in fact did not know that such a list exists.  What is more important is that many systems in our society are going through transformations &#8212; and one can argue about &#8216;validity&#8217; and implications of those but their existence makes you think about the future.  The system in which a few people formed a &#8216;society&#8217; and that society conferred an honor such as a &#8216;Fellow&#8217; (and luckily I have a fair share of those) was a different mechanism than creating purely in a bottom-up manner a list like this one.  Is this going to become as commonly&#8211; or more &#8212;  used method of recognition?  Time will tell.  I feel that the last few year&#8217;s socio-technical changes are definitely transformative.</p>
<p>In any case, THANKS to those who made my &#8216;ego&#8217; feel good by putting me on this list.  Now I am more motivated to contribute some ideas that will make me convinced me that I belong in a list like this.</p>
