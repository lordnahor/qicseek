<LI><A NAME="QQ1"><H2>What is relationship between HTML and 
SGML?</H2></A> As found in James Powell's 
<A 
HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/html-jpowell/slide1.html">Introduction to HTML</A>, HTML 
(Hypertext Markup Language)is just one application of SGML that is used to "mark-up" web documents.  
Both HTML and SGML were invented by Tim Berners-Lee of CERN.  In fact, <A 
HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/HTML.html">Hypertext Markup Language</A> states that 
HTML is a generalized SGML language that can be used for a wide variety of applications.<p><A 
HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to 
list of questions.</it></a> <LI><A NAME="QQ2"><H2>What recent UFO sightings have occured in 
Europe?</H2></A>
According to <A HREF="http://www.bgsu.edu/~jzawodn/ufo/misc/Belgium.html">Summary Report of 
Belgian UFO Activity</A>, the MC of the Air Defense radar station of Glons, Belgium, got a phone 
call from a person swearing they saw three separate, brightly blinking lights in the clear sky 
above (and they were changing colors, too!) Within the depths of an obscure <A 
HREF="file://ftp.rutgers.edu/pub/ufo/england.50s.Z"> Rutgers Page</A>, an employee of England's 
Jodrell Bank Observatory claimed to have scanned a strange craft flying at unearthy speeds in the 
1950's.  Unfortunately, over the period of human recorded history, the limited
martian activity that has taken place in Europe has been catagorized into 
superstition and folklore.</H2></A> <p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of 
questions.</it></a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ3"><H2>What kind of person what Vincent van Gogh and what movement in modern art 
did he influence?</H2></A> Vincent van Gogh was an immense influence on the coming of modern art's 
post-expressionism, as can be noted in his work within <A 
HREF="http://www.emf.net/louvre/paint/auth/gogh/">Le WebLouvre, Paris</A>.  Vincent was also noted to 
be a great influence on <A HREF="http://www.emf.net/louvre/paint/glo/fauvism/">Fauvism</A>.  In his 
personal life, Van Gogh was tormented by his lack of unrequitted love for both women and Christ, but he 
had a loving brother that funded his artistic pursuits. Through the course of his 
short ten years as an artist, Vincent managed to produce 800 paintings and an 
equal amount of sketches/renderings. <p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of

<LI><A NAME="QQ4"><H2>What do critics have to say about Broadway's production of <STRONG>  Love! 
Valour! Compassion!</STRONG> and what's its relation to <STRONG>Shakespeare</STRONG>?
 </H2></A> Although the show has only been running for a little over a month at The Walter Kerr 
Theatre (at 219 West 48th Street), the critics are confident about its ability to entertain.  As 
listed at <A HREF="http://www.webcom.com/~broadway/kerr.html">Love!</A>, Michael Kuchwara of the 
Associated Press felt the play to be "Heartfelt and Stirring".  Evoking similiar emotion is a 
catalogue of 37 plays that Bill Shakespeare set into history over 400 years ago.  Each year, <A 
HREF="http://www.circus.com/~jasona/shakespearSantaCruz.html">Shakespeare Santa Cruz</A> displays a 
modernized but still terrific rendition of two Shakespeare classics.<p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to 
list of questions.</it></a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ5"><H2>What popular European applications are available via 
telnet?</H2></A>There are several server sights available through telnet, 
that just happen to be located in a few obscure regions of Europe.  By 
tapping into the <A 
HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/guide.61.html/">Guide to 
Cyberspace</A>, a few of these options will become available. (Watch for that 
Slovakian connection, though--you may have to wait until your next 
birthday before it's finished downloading).  For something most 
interesting and exciting, you may want to dive into <A 
HREF="http://rescomp.stanford.edu/jobs.html#telnetjob">On-line Job 
Services</A> offered through Telnet Services.  Go ahead and click onto 
NISS, and you'll be given the NISS GATEWAY MAIN MENU, through which you 
can find an array of information and employment opportunities in the UK 
and neighboring university departments.
