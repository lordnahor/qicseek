		<description><![CDATA[I am loving your comments 2 &amp; 3 here - this fits very well with my own areas of research.  I hope we can chat later this week - that would be great.  As you point out, the work you did in the 90&#039;s - with the multiple camera placements/interactions -  was the best example I could find of a phenomenon I am sure will be proliferating rapidly these days.  We have a heightened &quot;3D consciousness&quot; coming upon us - also reflected in the wave of 3D product and films about to be launched in the consumer sphere of the next couple of years too.  I am not sure they&#039;ve gotten it right, but nonetheless - 3D/distributed viewing is totally happening - IMHO!  LOL.]]></description>
