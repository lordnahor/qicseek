    In this lab, we are going to explore the famous "Monty Hall
    Problem." You will gain more practice with using R, in particular,
    writing functions in R. If you get stuck with the R code, it may be
    a good idea to go back and review the R programming you learned in <a

    The lab assignment this week has two parts: (1) hands-on simulation
    using a deck of cards, (2) simulation using R. If you attend
    discussion, you will do the first part and hand it in during
    discussion, leaving only part 2 to do on your own at home. <br>
    <br>
    <u>If you miss discussion</u>, you will have to do both parts on
    your own at home. Follow the instructions in part 1 below, print and
    complete the part 1 worksheet <a href="Lab2-Monty-Hall-Wkst.pdf"><b>here</b></a>,
    and turn it into your TA (or the Stat 120A drop-slot in the wall
    across the hall from DBH 2202) before the due date. <i>You will
      need to find at least two other people to do the activity and
      complete the worksheet with you</i> (even if they're not in this
    class!). <br>

    <h2>Part 1: Hands-On Simulations</h2>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>The American television show <i>Let's Make a Deal</i> was hosted
      for many years by Monty Hall. The Monty Hall problem is a
      probability puzzle, loosely based on this game show and named
      after its original host. The problem became famous as a question
      from a reader's letter quoted in Marilyn vos Savant's "Ask
      Marilyn" column in <i>Parade</i> magazine in 1990:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;
          charset=windows-1252">
        Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of
        three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats.
        You pick a door, say No.&nbsp;1, and the host, who knows what's
        behind the doors, opens another door, say No.&nbsp;3, which has
        a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door
        No.&nbsp;2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?<br>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>What do you think? Should you switch doors or not? Why?<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Instructions<br>
    </h3>
    You are going to simulate the game show using a deck of cards which
    will be provided to you. Form a group of 6 people and divide your
    team into two groups of 3 each. In each group of 3 choose:
    <ol>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>The contestant</li>
        <li>The game show host (Monty Hall)</li>
        <li>The recorder<br>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
    When finished with 10 rounds of the game, rotate roles and repeat
    the process so each person fulfills each role once. Therefore, you
    will complete 3 sets of 10 rounds one for each person as the
    contestant.<br>
    <br>
    One round of the game goes as follows:<br>
    <ol>
      <li><u>Contestant</u>: Turn around and close your eyes so you
        can't see what's happening.</li>
      <li><u>Host</u>: Take 3 cards from the deck - one face card (J, Q,
        or K) and two non-face cards (A, 2,..., 10). The face card will
        represent the car, and the two non-face cards the goats. Place
        the three cards face down on the table in a random order, <i>keeping

          track of which card is the face card</i>. Make sure the cards
        are aligned the same way so the contestant does not see any
        difference between the three cards.</li>
      <li><u>Contestant</u>: Turn around to face the table and guess
        which card hides the car (the face card) by pointing to it. It
        will not be revealed yet!</li>
      <li><u>Host</u>: You are going to reveal <i>one of the un-chosen
          cards</i> to show the contestant that it is not the car (the
        face card). Here is how you decide what to reveal:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>If the contestant guessed a non-face card (goat), reveal the
          REMAINING NON-FACE CARD.</li>
        <li>If the contestant guessed the face card (car), RANDOMLY
          choose which other card to reveal. Do NOT let the contestant
          see you hesitating, or he/she will know that they guessed the
          correct card. They must not know if they guessed the correct
          card or not at this point.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li><u>Contestant</u>: You now have a choice. You can KEEP your
        original guess, or you can SWITCH to the other remaining card.
        If you choose the face card, you win a car! Use your intuition
        each time to decide whether to keep your original guess or
        switch to the other remaining card.</li>
      <li><u>Recorder</u>: Keep track of the combination of whether the
        contestant <i>switched or not</i> and <i>won or lost</i>.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    After finishing the hands-on simulations, use your data (combined
    with your classmates' data) to make a guess as to what you think the
    probability of winning the car is under each of the two strategies
    (switching or not).<br>
