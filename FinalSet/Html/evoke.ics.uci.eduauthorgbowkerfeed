<p>Struggling with the definition of the novel form, E.M. Forster came down reluctantly to the finding that ‘Yes, oh dear yes, the novel tells a story’. There’s really no way around that, even though folks like Joyce have done their darnedest. I feel the same nebulous dismay when I try to define what an academic product is. Here’s a form that articles take in the field of computer supported cooperative work: wide ranging introduction; literature review section which covers far more reading than you will use in the text; truncated methods section which doesn’t allow you to interrogate the text easily; objective findings, which generally seem otherwise; discussion, which is too short, and (pace Paul Dourish), implications for design. If I’m asked what it is that most academics write most of the time, I’d have to say: “Yes, oh dear yes, the canonical academic product is the finding”.</p>
<p>Who gets to read the unparalleled output that comes off the knowledge assembly line? Well, that’s a more difficult question. In the nineteenth century, when what we call the archival literature was first developed, there was a sense of an academic field in most areas being at most several hundred. I can read that sort of output – still do, though it tends to be from my 700 closest friends. Today, the average academic article is cited by none and read by two. And yet we persist in the venture. We adhere, especially in the human and social sciences, to the myth of the single author. Indeed our whole PhD system is very good at creating individual workers, who frequently get lost when they have to work in a fully collaborative environment. You can partly say the collaboration was always already so – an archival journal is at best a conversation, editors and peer reviewers help in the writing, as do audiences in the classroom or on the conference circuit. And yet that’s not the way we think, and not the way that we get PhDs or promotions. In a world where the preprint can be the true archival literature (archiv-X), we have a broken system that can neither recruit enough readers nor reflect our actual modes of knowledge production.</p>
<p>One place to look right now is in the performance of knowledge. There is recent work in anthropology on seeing dance as just such a form – the Science annual competition for dancing your Phd is an amusing derivative. There is a body of work in anthropology around dancing knowledge and wisdom. Dance is a rich modality for knowledge expression. Eevi Beck’s Thundering Silence work, for example, involves a text narrator, an automated Prezi presentation and herself dancing. Just like the motif in Wagnerian opera, the dancer provides a rich subtext to the text and images. The knowledge experience for the witness resonates in all registers simultaneously.</p>
<p>Hans Rösling’s TED talks are a good example of performed knowledge. I disagree with almost all his findings, but they are impressive for his use of his body, together with artefacts and his gapminder application. This dynamic form of expression is not new – as Rembrandt’s Anatomy Lesson (1632) reminds us. The very movement of the bubbles in gapminder expresses his findings much better than could any static text. However, today the performance of knowledge is frequently captured and preserved; and the performance can be richer, more convincing and more memorable than any text.</p>
