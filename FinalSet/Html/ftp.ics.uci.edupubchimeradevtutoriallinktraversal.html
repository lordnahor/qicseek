<H2>Traversing the Link between the Images</H2>

<p>&nbsp; 
To traverse between the images, you can click with the left mouse 
button from within the anchor area of any of the images.  This will cause the
anchors in the other images to flash.
</p>

<p>
You may traverse to a closed image.  To see this close wright_flight.jpg
and earthrise.gif -- leave bill.gif open.  Click in the anchor
area in bill.gif.  Both wright_flight.jpg and earthrise.gif will 
appear with their anchors flashing.

<p>The partial screen-shot above shows the three anchors in the 
wright_flight and earthrise images flashing after the anchor in bill was
clicked.
