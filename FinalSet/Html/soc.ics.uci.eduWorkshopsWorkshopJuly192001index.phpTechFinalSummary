            <p>These materials were assembled by the following 
              participants in the workshop: Matthew Bietz, Daniel Cooney, 
              Darren Gergle, Mark Handel, Larry Jacobs, Jim Myers, Huahai 
              Yang, and Xiaolong Zhang.</p>
            <p>The workshop on July 19-20 was the 
              second in our series. It explored the technology underpinnings 
              of collaboratories, bringing together researchers and developers 
              from industry, academia, and government to identify, define, 
              and discuss the state of collaboratory technologies and the 
              state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice in collaboratory 
              technology deployment. The goals were to capture lessons-learned, 
              identify current technology challenges, and lay the technology-related 
              groundwork for subsequent workshops and the overall project.<br>
              <br></p>
              <p class="head">Session Descriptions:</p>
            <p class="subhead">The Tools and Technologies of Collaboratories</p>
            <p>As a pre-requisite for further discussion 
              in the workshop, participants were asked to compile a list 
              of tools and technologies relevant to collaboratories. The 
              <a href="index.php?TechFinalSummary-ToolsAndTech#listOfTools">resultant 
              list</a> shows the breadth of applications, middleware, services, 
              technologies, and standards in use across collaboratory efforts. 
            </p>
            <p>In creating these lists, the groups questioned 
              the boundaries of collaboratories - can there be a collaboratory 
              of one, must members be separated by distance, are shared 
              resources (e.g. data or instruments) a requirement, is formation 
              of a new community a defining feature (versus supporting an 
              existing community), etc. While there was some disagreement 
              over whether specific extreme cases should be considered to 
              be collaboratories, there was agreement across a wide range, 
              which participants agreed is a contributing factor to the 
              broad range of tools in use and lack of agreement on a single 
              set of tools across the collaboratory development community. 
            </p>
            <p>While a mapping was not attempted, the 
              groups did identify several collaboratory-type-related dimensions 
              in which specific tools could be measured, e.g. number of 
              people who can be supported, or degree of formality in interactions. 
              Other dimensions, related more specifically to technologies, 
              were also identified. The <a href="index.php?TechFinalSummary-ToolsAndTech#Dimensions">combined 
              list</a> shows again why simple 'best of' comparisons of tools 
              cannot be applied across all collaboratories. </p>
            <p>Additional points discussed in this session 
              included the concept of collaboratory developers as systems 
              integrators. Some participants saw the inclusion of technologies 
              such as the telephone, email, and videoconferencing in the 
              list of collaboratory tools as evidence that collaboratories 
              represented a specific integrated use of more general tools. 
              Other participants emphasized the leadership role of collaboratory 
              developers in developing new tools, defining new work processes, 
              being early adopters of new technologies, and in innovating 
              through integration and concluded that systems integrator 
              did not capture the true scope. There was general agreement 
              that we are still at a point where collaboratory development 
              always includes elements of exploration.</p>

            <p class="subhead"><b><a name="CapabilityReturn"></a>Capabilities 
              Needed by Collaboratory Users</b></p>
            <p>Tools and technologies are deployed to 
              provide 'capabilities' to collaborators. During the second 
              breakout session, participants were asked to describe collaboratories 
              in terms of the users' goals and the (technology-independent) 
              capabilities they need to accomplish them. The motivation 
              of this exercise was to refocus participants on the end goals 
              of enabling collaboratory participants to work more effectively 
              and more efficiently, and to enable the subsequent discussion 
              of how well current and envisioned technologies map to the 
              capabilities required. </p>
            <p>The <a href="index.php?TechFinalSummary-Capabilities#Capabilities">list 
              participants created</a> encompasses a wide range of functionality 
              and shows significant diversity in the level of abstraction 
              at which participants addressed the question, e.g. &quot;LDAP 
              directory services&quot; versus &quot;resource information 
              services&quot; versus &quot;finding needed expertise&quot;. 
              As in the previous session, collaboratories were seen as exploratory 
              - as laboratories in which &quot;chat&quot; and &quot;persistent 
              chat&quot; tools might be replaced by functionality for &quot;capture 
              and replay&quot; of multimodal conversations and &quot;summarization&quot; 
              services as developers sought better ways to meet an underlying 
              requirement for recordable, reviewable conversations. Participants 
              identified high-level capabilities focused on user processes 
              (e.g. the capability to run an experiment) as well as capabilities 
              for tasks within these processes (e.g. the capabilities to 
              discuss experiment parameters, to tele-operate the instrument, 
              and to access data). </p>
            <p>Many group conversations anticipated the 
              next breakout session and highlighted the difficulties involved 
              in using currently available tools - from issues of communicating 
              across firewalls and different operating systems, to the stand-alone 
              nature of tools, which limits integration. Some groups noted 
              a conceptual mismatch in using commodity tools, which target 
              common tasks and often work only on the most popular computing 
              platforms, in a scientific setting where discovery and constant 
              evolution of resources (instruments, data types, analysis 
              tools) and processes are fundamental to progress. Conversely, 
              technologies being created to support e-business across organizations 
              (e.g. XML, web services) were seen as very well aligned with 
              the needs for flexibility, integrability, and evolvability 
              in scientific collaboratories.</p>

            <p class="subhead"><b>The Technology Issues Facing Collaboratories 
              &amp; Building a Collaboratory Technology Infrastructure: 
              Today and Tomorrow</b></p>
            <p>Using the information from the first two 
              sessions, participants were asked to use the third session 
              to explore the mapping between technologies and capabilities, 
              and to make concrete recommendations for building collaboratories 
              that would become operational today and in 3-5 years. </p>
            <p>Continuing the discussions from the previous 
              session, participants noted issues with specific implementations 
              of videoconferencing, chat, document sharing, and other tools. 
              There is clearly a need for such tools to continue to mature. 
              However, many of the most compelling visions of new capabilities 
              that would make distributed collaborations more natural and 
              more productive were not related to a specific tool, but rather 
              to the integration of many tools. Single sign-on, integrated 
              multimedia session records, awareness, persistent workspaces, 
              and information pedigrees were all cited as important next-generation 
              functionality that would be difficult to create using today's 
              collaborative tools. These in turn were seen as prerequisites 
              for research into knowledge management, agent-based automation, 
              etc. The development of collaboration middleware, and middleware-aware 
              tools, was seen as a key step in this evolution, though the 
              concern that such an approach would lead to a one-size-fits-all 
              mentality was also voiced. The chicken-and-egg issue related 
              to selling middleware and middleware-based tools was seen 
              as an argument in favor of an open source effort in this area.</p>
            <p>From their experiences building collaborative 
              technologies and creating working collaboratories, the participants 
              distilled a number of guiding principles, most of which might 
              fall under the category of 'uncommon sense' - perhaps obvious, 
              but too often overlooked. There was general consensus that 
              current-generation collaboratories could now be built from 
              off-the-shelf technologies, both commercial and open source. 
              Looking into the future, web, XML, and Java technologies were 
              seen as having increasing influence, due to both the low barrier 
              to entry for browser-based tools and the emergence of increasingly 
              powerful development tools (e.g. application servers). In 
              both cases, new collaboratory developers were urged to focus 
              on the user - address the most critical collaboration needs, 
              provide sufficient training, take an iterative approach and 
              evolve technologies as user expectations and practices evolve, 
              etc. While much of the advice could apply to any software 
              project, suggestions to provide an independent 'back-channel' 
              for resolving technical issues with the primary communications 
              mechanism, to emphasize simplicity and ease-of-use since collaboration 
              may be episodic, etc. directly address unique aspects of collaboratories. 
            </p>

              <a name="IssuesReturn"></a> </p>
            <p class="subhead"><b>Community and Knowledge Base Discussions</b></p>
            <p>A final recommendation - to become involved 
              in the 'collaboratory community' - addressed one of the motivating 
              issues for the Science of Collaboratories project and workshop 
              series. Collaboratories are being developed in a wide range 
              of science and engineering communities (and beyond) and research 
              into collaboratory-related technologies and work practices 
              is similarly spread across many disciplines. The workshop 
              participants concurred with the organizers that efforts to 
              coordinate these activities and to share lessons-learned would 
              be very valuable. </p>
            <p>As part of the closing plenary session, 
              participants discussed ways to strengthen the emerging collaboratory 
              community - from email lists to collaboratory-focused special 
              journal issues, standardized evaluation tools, and a community 
              portal and knowledge base. Specific items within the discussion 
              included a review of relevant journals and conferences and 
              a presentation of initial work within the Science of Collaboratories 
              project to develop a comprehensive questionnaire to capture 
              various aspects of a collaboratory project - scope, focus, 
              technologies, maturity, etc. - as part of an effort to build 
              a community knowledge base.</p>
