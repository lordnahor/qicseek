<li>Coursework will consist of one homework per week, assigned in
lecture on Thursdays, and due at your discussion section on the
following Wednesday. Group work is not permitted. There will also
be one midterm and a final exam. The final grade will be based on a
combination of 30% homework, 30% for the midterm, and 40% for the
final. 

<p></p>
</li>

<li>Add/drop policy: As of January 8, the registrar's computer is
showing 142 requests compared to a limit of 70 enrolled students in
the class. However it is also showing only 68 out of 70 slots
actually filled. I will start accepting add requests in the second
week of courses; based on those numbers I would expect any student
wanting to add to be able to do so. Drops will be allowed any time,
but you must drop both the lecture and the discussion section. Your
TA can sign your drop cards. You may switch sections with the TA's
approval, and as long as there is room for you in the new section. 

<p></p>
