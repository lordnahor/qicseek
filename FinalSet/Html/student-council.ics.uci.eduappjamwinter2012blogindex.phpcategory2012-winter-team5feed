<p>The app is now finished, ready to be submitted.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Today:</strong></p>
<p>We have been working on the app since 5PM today trying to finish the app and put everything together. It was really tough trying to get everything to work. The good news is that the interface looks a lot better than what we had before due to making some major changes to the interface. We added background image, added some unique features to the app, and adjusted the arrangement of the objects in the screen.</p>
<p><strong>Major Challenge:</strong></p>
<p>The biggest challenge that we had was putting everything together under a time constraint.</p>

<p><strong>Progress Today:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>We met for a long time today to discuss and work on the app. Most of our work prior today was on separate classes, but we made good progress as far putting all of our work together.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<p>We still have some features that we would like get running, and we likely have lots of testing and debugging to do before the deadline.</p>

<p>We have a good portion of the app completed, but we still need to tie everything together. We put off adding some extra nonessential features, but if we can get the app together  in time tomorrow, we will consider implementing them.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Today:</strong></p>
<p>We finished up the individual tasks and worked together to get closer to unifying the app pieces. We worked together to plan for the unification and help each other with parts of the app that needed help.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong>:</p>
<p>We have a busy day ahead of us to finish the app. We haven&#8217;t been able to have everyone meet to work together on the app, so we really need to finish up the app tomorrow. Hopefully we can get it done early so we can consider adding some extra functionality. In addition, all but one members of our team don&#8217;t have Android experience, so it&#8217;s been difficult to set aside time to do the necessary research, while still dealing with school and other daily things.</p>

<p>We are trying to wrap up our work for building activity classes and layout XMLs for the screen. Database is up, so once we get these activity classes working, we will be able to connect the UI with the database.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Today:</strong></p>
<p>Due to conflicting schedules, not all of our members were able to meet today. But no worries! Each of us are working hard on our assigned tasks, and we will be able to meet tomorrow to put everything together.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<p>Due to midterms and busy schedules, we weren&#8217;t able to meet together and program as a group.  Schedule conflict was definitely one of the challenges we had today. Also, trying to figure out solutions to problems only with a help of websites and tutorials was more difficult than expected.</p>

<p>The overall design is complete now, and starting from tomorrow, we are going to start coding major framework of the app.</p>
<p><strong>Progress today:</strong></p>
<p>We revised and updated our design, and assigned tasks to each team members. We also made a general timeline to help us to stay on track and to prevent us from running out of time at the end.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>One of the challenges we had was when we were revising design, and assigning tasks to each group members.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Current Project Status:</strong><br />
No coding has been done yet, but we have decided on all of the basic features of our app. The general layout for the UI has also been sketched out.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Today:</strong><br />
We met this evening to further discuss the feature set and UI for the app. We are set on the main features that we want to implement and we have a good idea of how the app will look and how the user will interact with it. Also, we discussed what each of us will have to read and learn in preparation for coding the project.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong><br />
Each of us will have to do some studying to learn how to implement certain features. This may be a struggle because we are also dealing with midterms and projects. We will also have to set up a system in which we will coordinate our programming.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Current Project Status:</strong><br />
Currently, we have our idea for the app and basic design of the UI set. We have discussed the key features and even some extra for added versatility. Communication and planning is done through a Facebook group (when we can&#8217;t meet in person).</p>
<p><strong>Progress Today:</strong><br />
Today, we met in the evening and decided on an idea for the app and its basic functionality and features.  We have a vision for the UI, but we will need to make final decisions before we move forward with it. We received the webspace and MySQL database for use with the app, and we discussed how we will integrate it with our idea. We also did some minor delegation of tasks, but again, we will need to finalize our ideas before we can do serious work on the research/coding.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong><br />
It&#8217;s going to be tough finding time on the weekdays to make major headway on the app, so the weekends might be looking pretty busy for us. We&#8217;re also going to need to do a good amount of research in learning how to use the webspace and database with Android, in addition to coding with Android itself, as we do not have much experience with app development.</p>
