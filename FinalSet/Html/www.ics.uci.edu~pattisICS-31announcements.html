  In-Lab Exam #2

I have graded and recorded the grades for In-Lab Exam #2 (recall that I
  cancelled In-Lab Exam #1)
The class average was about 68% (or about 68%); the median was about 72 (or
  about 72%).
The scores were very skewed, with many students (41%) scoring As and many
  students (34%) scoring Fs after normalization (and many fewer scoring grades
  in-between).
I'm sure combining both in-lab exams into one (covering 4 different parts of the
  course) contributed to the low scores.
I will take this issue under advisement when I compute final grades.

There are two files that you should download, unzip, and examine to understand

<p>
<ul>
<li>The first stores the
   <a href="solutions/program6gradesstudents.zip">assignment grades</a>, a
   zipped Excel file that details how each student was graded on this
   instrument: check my solutions on EEE; <b>reachable</b> was worth 25
   points and <b>instant runoff voting</b> was worth 20 points.
   Columns are blank (correct), P (partially correct), or X (incorrect).
This file is is sorted by the last 5 digits in your student ID.
If you do not see your student ID (look carefully) please contact me by email.
<p>
<li>The second file to examine is the grades spreadsheet that is available from
   the index on the course web: it records all the grades for all the testing
   instruments that I assign over the quarter.
It is sorted likewise.
You will notice that in the second spreadsheet all numbers are rounded up to
  integers: so receiving a 27.5 on the first spreadsheet will translate to a 28
  on the second one.
We will use this same process for recording all grades during the quarter.
If you do not see your student ID (look carefully) please contact me by email.

<p>
Generally most students finished well.
Again, these were complicated programs with intricate control structures, and
   now requiring the use of functions and data types (here dictionaries and
   sets).
<p>
<b>IMPORTANT</b>
If you believe that we recorded one or more answers incorrectly, please
  <b>email your TA</b> (see the fact sheet; also cc a copy to me) and tell him
  what you think the differences are.
The TA for your lab is responsible for grading all the programs in your lab.
Please read the comments in the <b>assignment grades</b> spreadsheet carefully
  <b>before</b> contacting your TA and ensure you understand the correct
  answers.
He will then re-examine issue, possibly asking you for more information if there
  is still confusion, or talking to you during the lab meeting.
If there is a difference, he will email me a revised summary about
  your program, and cc a copy to you.
I will update the grades spreadsheet as appropriate (it might take a bit of
  time for all these events to cumulate in a changed grade).
If you feel there is still a problem after talking to the TA, please
  contact me (but always contact the TA first).

Generally most students are still doing well, although the complexity of the
  programs is increasing (but hopefully so are your programming skills).
These were complicated programs with intricate control structures, and now
   requiring the use of functions and data types (here lists).
The next assignment adds dictionaries and sets into the mix, which allows for
  processing data in much more complicated ways, still revolvling around
  functions.
Hopefully your experience with on kind of data-type will help you better
  (and more quickly) understand others.

  Midterm
</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
The TAs have graded (and I have recorded the grades for) the midterm exam
The class average was about 70% and the median was 69%.
The grades recorded in the spreadsheet are the actual exam grades.
Because the average was below 75%, about 5 normalization points are used in
  computing the average of all graded instruments.
Yan graded problems 1, 4, and 7; Xiangxin graded 2, 3, 5, and 6. David graded
  problems 8, 9 and 10.
<p>
The approximate distribution of grades on the midterm, after normalization,
  is 20% As, 19% Bs, 18% Cs, 28% Ds, and 15% Fs.
The lab averages were Lab 1 69 (quiz average 73), Lab 2 70 (quiz average 74),
  Lab 3 70 (quiz average 70),and Lab 4 71 (quiz average 77).
<p>
Now is a good time to look at course grades as well, as you have now taken
  about half of the total number of testing instruments: so this is the first
  time that recorded grades are meaningful.
The approximate distribution of course grades (for those student who submitted
  a midterm exam) is is 24% As, 39% Bs, 22% Cs, and 15% Ds and Fs, which is
  close to my speculation of 25% in each of these categories.

  #4: 4/15/13<br>
  Programming Assignment #0 Graded
</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
Programming Assignment #0 has been graded.
There are two files that you should download, unzip, and examine to understand
  you performance on this assignment and cumulative performance in this class.
<p>
<ul>
<li>The first stores the
   <a href="solutions/program0gradesstudents.zip">assignment grades</a>, a
   zipped Excel file that details how each student was graded on this
   instrument: why points were deducted.
You will see the deducted points in cells.
If you hover over a commented cell (those with a red-triangle in the cell's
  upper-right hand corner) you will see a comment that explains why the points
  were deducted.
This file is is sorted by the last 5 digits in your student ID.
<p>
<li>The second file to examine is the grades spreadsheet that is available from
   the index on the course web: it records all the grades for all the testing
   instruments that I assign over the quarter (so far, just this one; soon
   Quiz #1 too).
It is sorted likewise.
You will notice that in the second spreadsheet all numbers are rounded up to
  integers: so receiving a 27.5 on the first spreadsheet will translate to a 28
  on the second one.
We will use this same process for recording all grades during the quarter.
</ul>
<p>
This assignment was designed to test you on whether you have mastered the
   basics of using Python in Eclipse (and know the course web, via the survey
   questions).
 It was also designed to see if you could follow instructions and ask
    questions: more on that below.
<p>
The class avereage was 30 (or about 100%) and the median was 30
   (or about 103%).
The assignment was not meant to be hard, but it was not trivial either, and
  there were many opportunities to lose points.
Now that we are on to real programming assighnments, I expect you are gaining
  more familiarity with Eclipse and having an easier time using it.
<p>
Let me talk about what will probably be the most contentious single point of
  the 1,000 points that this course is worth (thus .1% of the grade): the point
  was lost by 89 students (or about 50%).
I took off 1 point if you corrected the misspelling <b>Inteprxter</b> (and
  two points if you didn't have either spelling: in this second case you
  obvious failed to meet the specifications because you did not print what was
  required).
When some students hear about this point deduction, their heads explode and
  they cannot believe that I am taking off a point for correcting what you
  thought was my mistake.
But... I am trying to foster an atmosphere where nothing is taken for granted in
  the instructions I give: if anything seems confusing or plain wrong, I should
  be questioned about it -preferably in public, so others can learn about the
  problem and the correction.
For some background, check out Mr. Lill in the course overview.
<p>
Some students did ask me in class if they should correct the misspelling, and I
  told them no; some students asked me by email if they should correct the
  misspelling, and I told them no; if anyone would have asked on the Forum
  whether they should have corrected the misspelling, I would have responded
  no on the Forum (which some students would have read).
It is critical for programmers to be sure they know the specifications of the
  problem they are being asked to solve, otherwise they will solve, test, debug
  document, etc. the problem incorrectly, and another cycle of development will
  be needed to fix the misconceptions.
The overview lecture included a graph that showed that the later in development
  a problem is found, the harder/more expensive it is to fix.
So if we can find problems at  the time we are reading the specification of the
  problem to solve, that can save us a lot of work/money later.
<p>
The bottom line is that you are responsible for reading the instructions
  carefully and reporting any confusion so that I can clear it up (best reported
  on the MessageBoard Forum for Programming Assignments).
Of course, you can freely talk to anyone about the problem specifications, just
  not the code you write for your solutions.
If you make any assumptions and don't ask about them, they might come back
  later to haunt you (gradewise).
When working with a partner, you'll have two eyes reading the specification.
I am willing to deduct a point from many students to get across this
  perspective.
<p>
<b>IMPORTANT</b>
If you believe that we recorded one or more answers incorrectly, please
  <b>email your TA</b> (see the fact sheet; also cc a copy to me) and tell him
  what you think the differences are.
The TA for your lab is responsible for grading all the programs in your lab
  (the TAs will jointly grade the quizzes: one TA per problem across all labs).
Please read the comments in the <b>assignment grades</b> spreadsheet carefully
  <b>before</b> contacting your TA and ensure you understand the correct
  answers.
He will then re-examine issue, possibly asking you for more information if there
  is still confusion, or talking to you during the lab meeting.
If there is a difference, he will email me a revised summary about
  your program, and cc a copy to you.
I will update the grades spreadsheet as appropriate (it might take a bit of
  time for all these events to cumulate in a changed grade).
If you feel there is still a problem after talking to the TA, please
  contact me (but always contact the TA first).

  #3: 4/10/13<br>
  Quiz #1
</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
I have graded (and recorded the grades for) Quiz #1.
The class average was about 20 (or about 82%); the median was 22 (or about
  88%).
Look at your returned work carefully; if your score was below 20 (many were)
  you might want to review this quiz with me or a TA.
Material similar to this will be on the first written exam.
<p>
After I return your graded work in class on Wednesday, please download the 
  <b>Grades(zipped .xlsm file)</b> from the course web and ensure that I have
  computed and entered your grade correctly (I'll be entering thousands of
  grades for students in my course this quarter, so even if I'm 99% accurate,
  I'm likely to record some incorrect grades.
Note that all grades are recorded as integral values: I always round up
  (e.g., an exam score of 22.5 is recorded as 23).
<p>
If you do not pick up your returned work in class, you should pick it up during
  my office hours ASAP; I don't like keeping student quizzes: it makes my office
  messier, and you don't get the benefit of the feedback written on the quiz.
<p>
Here were some common mistakes:
<ul>
  <li>Problem 1: Many students either left out one or two lines needed in the
        syntax chart (some omitted it altogether) or incorrectly computed
        whether a few words were <b>Legal</b> or <b>Illegal</b> according the
        EBNF or syntax chart.
  <p>    
  <li>Problem 2: Some students got this completely correct while others had
        close solutions; some not so close answers.
      Some had "useless rules" (e.g., comma <= , just use the , in another
        rule) or minor or major bugs in their EBNF rules:
        <b>name-sequence <= name{, name} and name</b> was
        common, but that  doesn't allow just one <b>name</b>; likewise, the
        rule <b>name-sequence <= name{, name}[and name]</b> does allow
        <b>Bob, Bob</b> when it shouldn't.
      Some students wrote only the Right Hand Side of the rule, not the
        Left Hand Side nor "is defined as" arrow.
      There were a few students who specified a Right Hand Side without using
        <b>name</b>, some didn't include commas nor the word "and"; these
        students appear lost about synthesizing EBNF descriptions.
  <p>    
  <li>Problem 3: Some students did get this completely correct, while others
        had lots of small mistakes: some students didn't put in enough vertical
        lines to separate all the tokens; others did not write the categories
        on top, or include the types of the literals.

  Install Course Software

<td width ="80%">
  All students with computers should download and install the course Software:
    Java (to run Eclipse), Python, and Eclipse.
  All three products are available for free on the internet.
  Students can view instructions for downloading and installing this software
    by following then
    <a href="../common/online.html" target="main">Course Software</a>
    link.
  If you are using a Mac, read the <b>Hints for Mac Users</b> first.
  <p>
  Although students can work on their programming assignments on the computers
    in the UCI labs, I expect students with computers to download and instal
    this software by the end of the first week of the quarter.
  If you are having difficulty with this task, the TAs and Lab Tutors will help
    you during the first Lab meeting (or beyond, if necessary: bring your
    computer to the lab); if you have successfully downloaded and
    installed this software, please help other students do so too.
