		<description><![CDATA[I love content and how it flows.  When writing we know that text is not the only way to communicate.  We now embed videos, slideshows, consumer polls and other types of widgets.

People once thought that video would be the only way, but my preference is text and image.

By the way, I did a case study with Google &quot;taken out of context&quot;, which gave my thoughts back in 2004.  Now we have google coming out with the new &quot;cloud&quot; system to kill the pc forever!]]></description>
