<A NAME="Introduction"><H1> INTRODUCTION:</H1></a> 
<LI>I want to provide those individuals, such as myself, that are exploring 
their religious beliefs, an opportunity and a resource guide to help them 
explore their religious beliefs over the internet.  The internet provides a 
lot of useful information about religion, and it can prove to be a 
useful tool in helping someone, like myself, gain a better insight into 
different religions of the world. I will provide links to places to find out more 
information about many different religions, but will concentrate on Christinanity and 
Islam. There are the two religions that I have interest in finding out more 
information.  This paper is by no means conclusive or exhaustive, but 
mearly a place to start for those that might need help in finding a good 
resource. So let's start to <A HREF="http://lycos.cs.cmu.edu/"> explore</A>!!!
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="Christianity"><H1>CHRISTIANITY</H1></A>
<LI>Although, there are many different branches of Christianity, they do have
a few common beliefs among them.  And some would even say that they don't even have 
anything in common.  Well, the church has probably been hypocritcal at various times
(mainly because we're all human, we all fail now and again...). But
Christianity itself, as Jesus showed it, rises above this.
Christianity is not about rules and regulations. It is about forgiveness and
freedom. Forgiveness for our rebellion from God. Freedom to live life
to the full.
</P>
<p>
It's about God's son humbling himself to be born into this world.
About Him going through what we go through.  It's about Jesus living a 
perfect live and dying, so that He can offer forgiveness for our 
imperfect lives, so we don't have to die.  It's about Jesus being raised 
to life on the third day, and about us being able to know God personally. 
Now maybe some people do not agree with all of these things, but they are 
issues that effect the world in which we live in today.  There are many 
Christian's in the world and many of these beliefs our in there world 
view.  We must at least attempt to understand what and why a Christian 
believes, in order to better understand the world in which we live in.
If you would like to see some <A HREF=" 
http://www.transport.com/~kevinm/011sebr.html">tips</A> on making 
Christ apart of your life.  
</P>
If you would like to get more involved with
<A HREF="http://www.intele.net/~bowserd/bible.html"> learning</A>
 about the Christian church and their beliefs, there are several
<A HREF=" http://saturn.colorado.edu:8080/Christian/list.html">
resources</A> that can be found on the internet.  Christinanity has many beautiful 
<A HREF="http://www.christusrex.org/">images and art</A>associated with the religion as 
well, especially within the Catholic community.  

If anyone would would be interesting in learning about the
<A HREF="file://gate.net/pub/users/copeland/html/ca/ca.html">history</A> of
Christinaity, there are several good connections on the net as well, just
click on history.  There are also many other interesting sources on the 
net that help one to explore their budding religious beliefs.
An individual can also purchase information, including bibles and other
software, through the an online<A HREF="http://www.vir.com/bp/bp.htm>
bookstore</A>. This is some very interesting information about the various
<A HREF="http://tuna.uchicago.edu/homes/BIBLES.html"></A>bibles
</P>

<A NAME="Islam"><H1>ISLAM</H1></A>
<p>
<a HREF="http://www.biologie.uni-freiburg.de/~amueller/religion/islam.html">Islam</a> is 
the last of the great revealed religions and contains in itself 
the essential principles of all earlier religions. Islam is a strongly monotheistic 
religion with the worship of One God as its central theme. Islam requires its followers to 
believe in all earlier prophets and 
<A HREF="http://chestnut.enmu.edu/~stjeanp/quran.index.html">      
scriptures</a>, because according to Islam, all the great religions that
preceded it were revealed by God. Sadly, most of the old scriptures have 
been changed and tampered with, leaving them doubtful. 
</p>
<p>
Islam is not a religion of an ethnic group or a specific nation, rather 
it is the religion for all mankind. The <a 
HREF="http://www.utexas.edu/students/amso/Intro_To_Islam.html">religion</a> is called 
Islam because it offers peace and requires complete submission to the Will of God. 
For more islam resources please click on <A HREF="gopher://latif.com/11/islam"></a>   
Islam resources. <A HREF="http://www.utexas.edu/students/amso/">Islam</a> teaches that 
unless man learns to live at peace with himself and 
his fellow human beings he cannot live at peace with God. For other distinct features 
of Islam click on <a HREF="http://www.utexas.edu/students/amso/distinct.html">   
distinct features</a>.  The islamic religion has some very interesting
<A HREF="http://www.cs.yale.edu/HTML/YALE/CS/HyPlans/ahmed/islam.html"> articture and 
images</a> that surround the religion, if you would like to take a look at some of 
them, feel free to do so as you continue to explore.

Muhammad - The Prophet of Islam</A>

Hadhrat Muhammad (pboh) was born in Mecca (Arabia) in 570 AD and lived through
the first third of the seventh century.  For the purpose of communing with himself and 
imploring light and guidance from  the Supreme Being concerning the problems that 
troubled his mind and soul, he made a habit of retiring for several days at a time to 
one of the hills a few miles out of Mecca. There he occupied himself in prayer and 
contemplation. Hadhrat Muhammad (pboh) was forty years old when the
Divine call came to him in his retreat on Mount Hira. The very name of the
great faith ushered in through Hadhrat Muhammad (pboh) was
bestowed by God, as is affirmed by the <A 
HREF="http://www.utexas.edu/students/amso/quran_html/"> Holy 
Quran</A>: "This day have I perfected your religion for your benefit, and have completed
My favour unto you, and have chosen for you Islam as your faith." (5:4)

thoughts!</H1></A>

Possible Effects of the Global Media Expansion on Spiritual Values

Newspaper headlines have announced the arrival of the information 
superhighway. CD-ROMs, personal digital assistants, global telecommunications
satellites and the explosive growth of Internet users also contribute to 
the headlines and news articles heralding not only a media revolution, 
but a social revolution as well.
<LI><p>
There are many good and bad things that one can attribute to religion over 
the Internet.  Some of the good are, A much bigger view of the world and 
its people and the events affecting people, much more information, and A
broadening of horizons and a widening of perspectives.  Some of the bad 
are, a sense of lessening of control over these events, less 
involvement, feeling overwhelmed and disconnected, a greater sense of 
powerlessness and rootlessness.  Another That I can see happening is the 
rises in fundamentalism, due to the rapid change and outside influences.  
</P>
Yet, greater interconnectedness of peoples and cultures that the internet 
brings, may breed greater understanding, more frequent and meaningful contacts
and cooperation among diverse groups of people: discoveries of mutual 
interests and mutual respect.  The internet can help find ways to
work together to improve our lives, and our understand of not only the 
religion that one may believe in but all of the religions of the world in 
which we live.  Affordable, user-friendly computers interconnected over vast
high-speed global networks(The internet) can allow us so many 
opportunities 
</P>
An overriding concern is the continuation of ancient wisdom, ritual and 
tradition. The traditional practices of Christianity have 
lost much of their spiritual and mystical components as they have been 
embraced by western civilization even though they have survived for 
thousands of years. How can they, along with the hundreds of
other religions and cultures around the world, retain their spiritual 
legacies in the face of the media explosion which historically 
disseminates predominantly western values? The Internet will not help 
in this process.  Through the enlightened dedication of each religion and
culture's most adept scholars, practitioners and historians, translating 
their spiritual knowledge and wisdom to the new media, both audiovisual and data,
the future generations will have the opportunity to share in their ancestral heritage,
in new and more exciting ways..<A
HREF="(http://gopher.upenn.edu/rtvis/rtvis.html#summary">reference</a>
</P>
<p>
"Training spiritual practitioners in how to use the new media 
should become a high priority of the spiritual traditions within each 
culture. And through this process and traditions may be updated and transformed 
as they often as they need to be.  If religions want to get there message
out then the internet is the wave of the future, and they should be 
prepared to handle the enormous response".<A

</P>
<H1>Conclusion</H1>
The information that one can find on the net, will provide any 
person interested in learning more about the different religions 
in the world.  There are many extra <A HREF="http://www.utexas.edu/students/amso/ror/">   
reviews of different religions</a>. I provided two examples of various religions there 
are many more out there that I encourage everyone to explore!!  Have fun and Learn 
a ton!!!
