Number theory.
I survey and implement in <i>Mathematica</i> several methods
for representing rational numbers as sums of distinct unit fractions.
One of the methods involves searching for paths in a certain graph
using a <a href="p-kpath.html"><i>k</i> shortest paths</a> heuristic.

This paper presents an algorithm that finds multiple short paths connecting
two terminals in a graph
(allowing repeated vertices and edges in the paths)
in constant time per path after a preprocessing stage
dominated by a single-source shortest path computation.
The paths it finds are the <i>k</i> shortest in the graph, where <i>k</i> is a
parameter given as input to the algorithm.
<p>
The <i>k</i> shortest paths problem has many important applications for finding
alternative solutions to geographic path planning problems, network
routing, hypothesis generation in computational linguistics, and
sequence alignment and metabolic pathway finding in
bioinformatics. Although there have been many papers on the
<i>k</i> shortest paths problem before and after this one, it has become
frequently cited in those application areas.
Additionally, it marks a boundary in the theoretical study of the problem:
prior theoretical work largely concerned how quickly the problem could
be solved, a line of research that was closed off by the optimal time
bounds of this paper. Subsequent work has focused instead
on devising efficient algorithms for more complex alternative
formulations of the problem that avoid the repeated
vertices and other shortcomings of the alternative paths produced by
this formulation.

Shows how to find for any edge weighted graph G an equivalent
graph EG such that the <a href="mst.html">minimum spanning trees</a>
of G correspond one-for-one with the spanning trees of EG.
The equivalent graph can be
constructed in time O(m+n log n) given a single minimum spanning tree of
G.  As a consequence one can find fast algorithms for counting, listing,
and randomly generating MSTs.
Also discusses similar
equivalent graph constructions for

Beta-skeletons are geometric graphs used among other purposes
for <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/betadil.html">empirical
network analysis</a> and minimum weight triangulation.
A fractal construction shows that, for any beta&gt;0,
the beta-skeleton of a point set can have arbitrarily large dilation:
Omega(n<sup>c</sup>), where c is a constant depending on beta
and going to zero in the limit as beta goes to zero.
In particular this applies to the Gabriel graph.
We also show upper bounds on dilation of the same form.

<li><b>Diameter and treewidth in minor-closed graph families</b>.<br>
D. Eppstein.<br>
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/math.CO/9907126">arXiv:math.CO/9907126</a>.<br>
<i>Algorithmica</i> 27:275-291, 2000
(special issue on treewidth, graph minors, and algorithms).
<p>
This paper introduces the <i>diameter-treewidth
property</i> (later known as <i>bounded local treewidth</i>): a
functional relationship between the diameter of its graph and its treewidth.
Previously known results imply that planar graphs have
bounded local treewidth; we characterize the
other minor-closed families with this property. Specifically,
minor-closed family F has bounded local treewidth if and only if there
exists an <i>apex graph</i> G that is not in F; an apex graph is a graph
that can be made planar by removing a single vertex.
The minor-free families that exclude an apex graph (and therefore have
bounded local treewidth) include the bounded-genus
graphs (for which, as with planar graphs, we show a linear bound for the
treewidth as a function of the diameter) and K<sub>3,a</sub>-free graphs.  As
a consequence, subgraph isomorphism for subgraphs of bounded size and
approximations to several NP-hard optimization problems can be computed
efficiently on these graphs, extending previous results for planar
graphs.
<p>Some of these results
were announced in the conference version of
"<a href="p-psgi.html">subgraph isomorphism for planar graphs and related
problems</a>" but not included in the journal version. Since its
publication, there have been many more works on local treewidth. The class of
problems that could be solved quickly on graphs of bounded local
treewidth was extended and classified by Frick and Grohe, "<a
href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/504794.504798">Deciding first-order
properties of locally tree-decomposable structures</a>", <i>J. ACM</i>
48:1184-1206, 2001;
the proof that bounded local treewidth is equivalent to having an
excluded apex minor was simplified, and the dependence of the treewidth
on diameter
improved, by a subsequent paper of Demaine and Hajiaghayi, "<a href="http://erikdemaine.org/papers/DiameterTreewidth_Algorithmica/">Diameter and
treewidth in minor-closed graph families, revisited</a>", <i>Algorithmica</i>
40:211-215, 2004. The concept of local treewidth is the basis for the
theory of <i>bidimensionality</i>, a general framework for
fixed-parameter-tractable algorithms and approximation algorithms in
minor-closed graph families; for a survey, see Demaine and Hajiaghayi,

Greedy drawing is an idea for encoding network routing tables into the

the hyperbolic plane, which uses linearly many bits to represent each

We examine US road network data and show that, contrary to the
assumptions of much past GIS work, these networks are highly nonplanar.
We introduce a class of "multiscale dispersed" networks that better fit
the data; these networks are defined by a family of disks of varying
sizes such that, if a small number of outliers is removed, the remaining
disks cover each point of the plane a constant number of times.
As we show, these networks have good graph separators, allowing for
efficient algorithms for minimum spanning trees, graph Voronoi diagrams,
and related problems.

If a connected graph corresponds to a set of points and line segments in
the plane, in such a way that the number of crossing pairs of line
segments is sublinear in the size of the graph by an iterated-log
factor, then we can find the arrangement of the segments in linear
time. It was previously known how to find the arrangement in linear time
when the number of crossings is superlinear by an iterated-log factor,
so the only remaining open case is when the number of crossings is close to the
size of the graph.

We investigate greedy routing schemes for social networks, in which
participants know categorical information about some other participants
and use it to guide message delivery by forwarding messages to neighbors
that have more categories in common with the eventual destination.
We define the membership dimension of such a scheme to be the maximum
number of categories that any individual belongs to, a natural measure
of the cognitive load of greedy routing on its participants.
And we show that membership dimension is closely related to the small
world phenomenon: a social network can be given a category system with
polylogarithmic membership dimension that supports greedy routing if,
and only if, the network has polylogarithmic diameter.

The Bellman&ndash;Ford algorithm for single-source shortest paths in graphs
that may have negatively weighted edges but no negative cycles can be
sped up by a technique of Yen in which the graph is partitioned into two
directed acyclic subgraphs and edge relaxations alternate between these
two subgraphs. We show that choosing this partition randomly gains an
additional factor of 2/3 in running time.

We find an algorithm for making all possible deductions based on the set
of candidate locations for a single digit in a Sudoku puzzle; the
problem is NP-hard, and our algorithm takes exponential time, but the
mild form of the exponential allows it to be fast for practical problem sizes.

When a planar point set has the property that its Delaunay triangulation
has no large angles, we show how to connect it by a plane graph (having
linearly many additional Steiner vertices) in which the distances
between the original points are approximations to their Euclidean
distance, and in which the total graph weight is at most a constant
times the minimum spanning tree weight. The time to construct this graph
is near-linear, the same as for integer sorting. We use this result to
approximate the traveling salesman problem, for these point sets, in the
same time bound.
