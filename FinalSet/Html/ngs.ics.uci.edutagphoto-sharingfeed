				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>VisR has new version available on Android phones.  The new version works effortlessly on your android mobile phones.  Even if you don&#8217;t take photos using VisR, but other cameras &#8212; including the native camera &#8212; that put photos in the gallery of the phone, VisR will organize them in events, will allow you to search them based on type of events, people, places, and dates.  You can also edit events and annotate them.  The system helps you even when you did not use it to take and organize photos explicitly.  It acts like your personal butler &#8212; always working for you.  You can also share events (all or some photos) on facebook, twitter, or using email.  VisR is for sharing Visual Events, not just photos.</p>
<p>This system is also supported by the back end where all your shared photos are collected and you can share them with any body.  Photos from all users will also be available there and you could visualize them based on multiple search criteria.  </p>
<p>And the system is currently in its very early version.  All capabilities will be refined soon and new powerful introduced.  So if you have an android, download it from marketplace and enjoy.   For iPhone users, please wait for a bit more.</p>
<p>(Disclaimer:  I am a co-founder of mChron, whis is behind VisR.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you see something interesting happening, you take out your camera, now your mobile phone, and click.  And that becomes your secondary visual memory.  Clicking your phone camera is effortless and costs you almost zero.  So now you take many more photos than you used to just a few years ago.  The only hesitation is the thought that what will people say.  Soon you will never think about other people also &#8212; because this will be as common as carrying mobile phones.</p>
<p>This is not a secret that photo-sharing has been one of the most popular apps area in the last few months.  The number of photo-sharing apps, led by Instagram and others, on smart phones is growing faster than anything you know or expected. Clearly, there is strong demand for it and if Google + and new Facebook focus are any indication, this will only result in more people sharing more photos.  </p>
<p>However, only 1 in 10 or even smaller fraction of photos are ever shared.  Like wine, photos become more valuable as they age.  The take you back in time, they remind you of people, events, and places, and they help you reflect and reanalyze things.  With mobile phones, photos are also becoming as important as pen and your notebook used to be for taking notes.  And at the rate people take photos now, they soon face problems in managing those.  Most of my friends request me to send photos that I take at events.  And I confess that I am pretty bad in responding to their requests.  It is not easy to remember to go back fine their photos and send it to them or share those.  So what you do when you get a request to send a photo by a friend &#8212; you spend 15 minutes looking for the photo???  How do you usually remember where that photo could be.  It is usually the event &#8212; where you were with the person.  Now you need to locate photos of the event.  When thinking about this &#8212; it becomes clear that photos are our record of events.</p>
<p>In fact, in a true sense photos capture and record events or events are manifested by or come alive in photos.  Just think about how you create albums and you will find that they are based on trips, birthdays, wedding, conferences, concerts, festivals and so on.  Albums are mostly about events.</p>
<p>It is surprising that most photo management as well as photo sharing systems do not recognize this important fact.  Most photo sharing and photo organizing systems consider photos, people, places, objects, and events in the deceasing order of importance.  In fact the order should be events, people, objects, places, and photos.  A photo is worthless if it is not linked to an event, a person, an object or a place.  Most important of all:  Photos are about events.  Rememer &#8212; Kodak popularized &#8216;Kodak Moment&#8217; to emphasize that moment in an event.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pinaki Sinha finished his doctoral dissertation (under my supervision) on automatic summarization of personal photo collections.  As he states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Photo taking and sharing devices (e.g., smart phones, digital cameras, etc) have become<br />
extremely popular in recent times. Photo enthusiasts today capture moments of their personal<br />
lives using these devices. This has resulted in huge collections of photos stored in<br />
various personal archives. The exponential growth of online social networks and web based<br />
photo sharing platforms have added fuel to this fire. According to recent estimates [46],<br />
three billion photos are uploaded on the social network Facebook per month. This photo<br />
data overload has created some major challenges. One of the them is automatic generation<br />
of representative overviews from large photo collections. Manual browsing of photo<br />
corpora is not only tedious, but also time inefficient. Hence, development of an automatic<br />
photo summarization system is not only a research but also a practical challenge. In this<br />
dissertation, we present a principled approach for generation of size constrained overview<br />
summaries from large personal photo collections.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Considering the importance of the problem created by advances in photo related technology, this dissertation addresses<br />
and makes good progress towards solving an important problem for many people.  Very good dissertation.<br />
Congratulations, Pinaki, for a job well-done.</p>
