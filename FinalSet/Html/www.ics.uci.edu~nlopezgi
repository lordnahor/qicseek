				<tr><td align="right"><a href="http://sdcl.ics.uci.edu/research/code-topics/"><b>Code topics: Using topic models to understand the evolution of a software ecosystem: Sept 2012 - present:</a></b></td><td>The development of a software system is now ever more frequently a part of a larger development effort, including multiple software systems that co-exist in the same environment: a software ecosystem. Though most studies of the evolution of software have focused on a single software system, there is much that we can learn from the analysis of a set of interrelated systems. Topic modeling techniques show promise for mining the data stored in software repositories to understand the evolution of a system. In my research I seek to explore how topic modeling techniques can aid in understanding the evolution of a software ecosystem. The results of this research have the potential to improve how topic modeling techniques are used to predict, plan, and understand the evolution of software, and will inform the design of tools that support software engineering activities such as feature location, expertise identification, and bug detection.</td></tr>

				<tr><td align="right"><b><a href="unpublished/COSD-surveyPaper-FINAL-nlopez.pdf" title="COSD survey"> Survey of Concern oriented development: Sept 2011 - June 2012:</a></b></td><td>
				Concern-oriented development has been of significant interest to the software engineering community since the early formulation of its importance by Dijkstra and Parnas. Many different approaches have emerged since then, and continue to emerge, which support developers when they need to reason about and make changes to code in terms of the concerns that govern the system. While initially much work focused on modularization of concerns, relying on programmatic constructs to encapsulate concerns in modules, new types of approaches have more recently emerged that address the problem from quite different directions and lead to quite different forms of support.
				I have been working on a survey that is inclusive of the breadth of approaches to date. Its main contributions are a set of definitions of concerns that precisely delineate the field, an evaluation framework that characterizes a set of capabilities that any approach to concern-oriented development ideally should offer, an articulation of how four, previously disparate categories of approaches closely relate, and a set of nine observations that take stock of the field as it stands today and provide guidance as to where it should head in the future.
