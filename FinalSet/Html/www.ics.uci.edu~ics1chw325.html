<LI><A NAME="QQ1"><B>What are the most popular spices for the various cuisines in Hungary?</B></A>
The two most popular spices in Hungary are <a 
href="http://www.fsz.bme.hu/hungary/cuisine/cuisine.html"><b>paprika</b></a> 
and garlic.  Strings of ungrinded red pepper are hung to dry and then crushed.  These crushed 
red peppers are what is commonly referred to as paprika.  Paprika 
is a key ingredient to <a href="http://www.fsz.bme.hu/hungary/cuisine/goulash_soup.html"><b>Goulash</b></a>, 
which is one of the most famous Hungarian dishes.  
Although goulash was originally a soup, it has turned into a hearty stew.  
Now, people commonly add plenty of meat, carrots, 
and potatoes to goulash.  Goulash is just one of the many delicious 
cuisines from Hungary.<p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of

<LI><A NAME="QQ2"><B>What are the advantages of having a hotlist and what 
is an example of another person's hotlist? </B></A>
On the World Wide Web, searching for useful information is one of the 
most tedious tasks.  Once you've found a site that interests you, it 
is important to remember where it is located.  Luckily, there is an 
efficient way of marking and going to certain sites quickly.  The quick 
way of accessing other systems is by putting the URL of the system onto a 
<a href="http://ddi.digital.net/info/hot/"><b>hotlist</b></a>. <a 
href="http://www.oac.uci.edu/indiv/franklin/hotlist.html"><b>Professor 
Franklin's</b></a> hotlist is an example of a well made and informative 
hotlist of various sites on the Web.

<LI><A NAME="QQ3"><B>How can you search for various types of information on the Web with only 
key words and no URL's?</B></A>
In order to be able to go to various sites on the World Wide Web, it is 
necessary to have the URL's of the various servers.  There is a very 
useful tool available on the Web to anyone who wants to use it; this 
tool is called the <a href="http://webcrawler.cs.washington.edu/webcrawler/webquery.html"><b>Webcrawler</b></a>. 
 The Webcrawler allows you to search for various servers on the Web that 
have information on topics that you find interesting.  For example, if 
you wanted information on music, then you could type the word music in 
Webcrawler and it will send you to servers that contain information on 
music.  If you are interested in other valuable <a 
href="http://ea.oac.uci.edu/doc/globres.html"><b>resources</b></a> then 
check this out.  <p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of

<LI><A NAME="QQ4"><B>Where can I get information on Bank of America and get 
access to 
the location of the various branch and Versateller machines?</B></A>
In my opinion, Bank of America is a good bank because it offers a wide 
variety 
of services for it's customers.  <a href="http://www.bankamerica.com/"><b>Bank of America</b></a> is the 
second largest bank in the United States, with assets of $219 billion.  It 
has roughly 1900 retail branches in the Western United 
States and a network of 5500 Versateller machines.  In order to be able 
to utilize the vast resources for banking that Bank of America has to 
offer, it is useful to know the <a 
href="http://www.bankamerica.com/locations.html"><b>locations of 
the various branches</b></a>.  "Banking on America, Bank of America".

<LI><A NAME="QQ5"><B>Where can I find information on the cost and benefits of using the Internet?</B></A>
While surfing around the Internet, I came across a valuable find.  At the 
University of Michigan, Mr.Mason and Mr.Varlan 
held a <a 
href="ftp://gopher.econ.lsa.umich.edu/pub/Papers/useFAQs-slides.ps.Z"><b>lecture</b></a> on 
the costs and benefits associated with using the Internet.  The lecture 
contained information on how prices should be set for people using the 
Internet. The lecturers stated that, "Prices should reflect costs so people 
can make intelligent decisions."  There are also other interesting 
lectures on <a 
href="http://alfred.econ.lsa.umich.edu/EconInternet/Talks.html"><b>various economic topics</b></a> on the Internet.
