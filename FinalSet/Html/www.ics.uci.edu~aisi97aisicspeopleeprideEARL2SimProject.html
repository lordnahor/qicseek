June 24, 1997

<P>
Since age five I have explored and tried to understand things and events that
pertain to my immediate and global environment.  Analytically describing
myself with words such as rational, precise and intellectual would be a precise,
rational and intelligent choice of words.  I am optimistic yet cautious,
acquisitive yet domineering, introverted yet sociable, extroverted yet modest
and impulsive yet reserved.

<P>
I was born and raised in Southern California.  I have four children ages
10, 6, 3 and 18 months.  I graduated from Palo Verde High School in June
of 1979, and have worked at various jobs throughout the years.  

<P>
The Spring semester of 1985 I enrolled at Palo Verde Community College (PVC)
and continued on in the Fall.  Due to an employment change (promotion) my work
schedule conflicted with my existing educational schedule (both full time)
I withdrew from school, not knowing I had to formally withdraw I was placed on
academic probation.  In the Fall of 1988 I petitioned to return to school,
and was readmitted.  In 1993 I was diagnosed with a severe degenerative joint
disorder that will require a partial/total hip replacement.  

<P>
I enrolled again for the Fall 1995 semester as a full time student working
part time as a tutor/note taker for Extended Opportunities Program &amp Services
(EOPS) and Disabled Students Program & Services (DSP&S).  In the
Spring 1995 I received a letter from the President/Superintendent stating I
had achieved an 3.812 GPA which placed me on the Presidents list.  Ms.
Susan Black, DSP&ampS Coordinator, coordinated and started the DSP&ampS Peer
Counselor service at the end of the Spring 1996 semester and promoted me to
senior Peer Counselor where I have had the opportunity to help my peers and
myself achieve our academic goals.  The different difficulties that each
individual faces in their daily endeavors have me redefining words such as
respect, perseverance and character. 

<P>
I have worked with clients at the Valley Resource Center (VRC) of which PVC
offers a course for Developmentally Delayed Learners and have made numerous
new friends at VRC.  Through many workshops and meetings I have attained
enough of a foundation to train new Peer counselors that DSP&ampS employ.
A certificate of Appreciation was presented to me for the efforts above and
beyond the call of duty as a DSP&ampS Peer counselor in September 1996 by Ms.
Susan Black.

<P>
In the Fall of 1996 the Black Student Union was reactivated and I was selected
as interim vice-president.  Due to the BSU interim President resigning, I
became the BSU interim President.  In February I coordinated the cultural
activities for Black History/Women Month and helped organize and implement the
ABLE club at PVC.  The ABLE club, which is an acronym for Advocates for
Better Learning Experiences, is dedicated to promoting academic success,
accessibility and enrichment towards education and promoting awareness and
understanding of events and issues in the disabled community and all students
at PVC.

<P>
In May of 1997 I had the honor to be one of the speakers at the annual
Cinco de Mayo celebration and also participated in an EOPS sponsored parody
for their annual District Meeting.

<P>
I recently graduated with an A. A. Degree.  At the graduation ceremony I was
presented with the "Sophomore Man of the Year" award, Lions club scholarship
and the first recipient of an ABLE club scholarship.
