My book says that the Urzad Stanu Cywilnego in Chrzanow has limited vital
records.  Therefore, you will need to write (in Polish) to the USC in the
town (you don't need any street address) to inquire.  Chances are that there
were records from the town until about 1942.  The question is whether you can
find them today.


We've had a lot of pneumonia and bronchial problems here.  The baby is much
better but he's still coughing.


I've had an inquiry about H30 from a man who is related to Frank Langsam's
wife Esther, whom I now learn had the maiden name of Mensh.  The man is
sending me more information.  I will send it on to you as it develops. This
is a family that probably came from Jawornik Polski.  I found them
extensively in the records from that district.  But, it appears that Frank
and Esther lived in Bircza, not Jawornik.

Dear Suzan,
How nice to hear from you!  I'm glad that we've established some connection,
even if through marriage.  I'd be very grateful if you could help me find
ANYTHING about the Mensh or Damashek clans, by checking the yizkor book for
the Sanok area or any of your other resources.


Here's what I know about the Frank and Esther Langsam family. Frank had a
candy store in Brooklyn, NY on Christopher Avenue.  He and Esther (my
maternal grandmother's sister) had the following children:
    Grace, who married Nat Mash
    Ida, who married Aaron Chasen
    Louis, who married Jeanette Bander (whom you mentioned)
    Lilyan, who married Harry Elman
    Syde, who first married Hymie Kupperberg and then Rabbi Nathan Zuber
    Elsie, who married Oscar Einhorn and then ? Koffer
    Bertha, who married Leo Schimmel
    Morris
Of the above, I know my Mom and aunts were closest to Ida, who passed away
within the last 2 years.  My only other immediate contact is with Elsie
Koffer, who lives in Florida and could possibly provide you with more
information on the Langsam family.  I misplaced her address, but you can get
it by contacting her son, Dr. Roland Einhorn, who lives in Baltimore at 3
Ice Pond Court, 21208; (410) 486-0559.  Tell Roland and Barbara that I
referred you to them; they're lovely folks!  Roland can fill you in probably
on the cousins he has in his next generation, to make the tree even fuller
for this branch of Langsams.


If you can get information on Esther Langsam (nee Damashek), that will give
me a lead on my grandmother's family. How can I get further information
about Bircza, Polana, Lotowisk?


What was your daughter-in-law's maiden name?  I've been with Beth El as a
member for over 50 years, so we must have some mutual friends.


Hope my information was helpful, and hope you can help me further.


Allan Lipsitz


Hope some of this helps

I'll call the Einhorns very soon though I doubt that it will come to much beyond
what we know about the previous generations or how they are connected to the main
tree. Our information came from two members of the family who were more connected
to Europe than anyone living today and I don't expect that we will find out
anything startling.  However, I will follow up given that there is a known Bircza
connection and we seem to be on a path with many branches leading to Bircza.

Here's what the Einhorn folks wrote:


Elsie Hoffer was the person who wrote back.  She contacted the widow of a cousin
for some information but the widow knew nothing. Elsie provided a rather
disjointed account of the family.  I think I'll have to sort it all out and get
back to you.  The widow gave a couple of addresses which I will include when I
send you what I know....which is not much.  One of the addresses is in Israel and
the other is in Poland.  One of the relatives stayed in Poland and married there
(to a non-Jew) after the war.  I doubt that much will come of these contacts.

Can you tell me what parts of H30 were from Michael's letter and 
what parts you joined with Polish records?

Subject: Re: [Fwd: Langsam 2]

The nutshell is I have a theory that H6's Samuel (see  your 1988 
update) was the progenitor of H14, H15, H30 and H62. That is without 
the Louis Langsam from Argentina (whoever that is). This seems to 
hold based on what I have so far from various family. I also think 
that the cigar guy was from H30 as well, via the Morris. For this 
to be true, the H30 tree needs to be split. You mention in the 
original book that the tree was built open the theory that the 
Polish data matched the letter Michael received. So I am asking, 
must Frank's father be Leib? Do you have his death record or the 
name of the cemetery for Frank?

Happy Purim!

Dear Moishe,
I got your name and e-mail address from your website the internet.  
My name is Dr. Roland Einhorn and I am a grandson of the late Frank 
Langsam of Booklyn, New York. I currently live in Baltimore, Maryland 
but I am originally from New York City.  Last evening, I had dinner 
with Charlie Langsam, who is listed on your website as a member of 
the Israel Langsam family.  We were trying to figure out how we were 
related since both of our families originally came from Poland.

My grandfather died before I was born and my mother, Elsie Koffer 
(nee Langsam) has very little information about her father and his 
family.  My only other contact is a cousin named Chana Frimer (nee 
Langsam) who lives in Yavne, Israel.  My mother is listed on your 
website as part of the Lieb Langsam family of Jawornik.

Any information you could provide to me regarding my ancestors would 
be greatly appreciated. I have just ordered Suzan Wynne's book to get 
more information on how to research my family tree.

Sincerely,
Roland C. Einhorn, M.D.

Hi,
Thank you very much for your inquiry. I would be very interested 
in trying to expand upon what we already know. First of all, this 
is the family outline that I have for you immediate family. Please 
provide any additional corrections. I included Charlie's family 
outline below yours. Perhaps you can either pass along his email 
address or have him contact me. 

Chana Frimer comes from Osias, brother to Frank. 

I would be most interested in trying to take your families back 
further and connecting you to Charlie, as well as my own family.

Happy New Year!

Dear Moist:


Thank you so much for the information about my family tree.


There were a few mistakes:


My father, Mark Langsam had 8 brothers and sisters.  I only know the 
name of the youngest brother, Mendel Langsam.  All of this brothers 
and sisters died in the holocaust except for Mendel who went to 
Palestine in 1938 and died in Israel in 1983.


My father, Mark, married my mother, Ida in 1944 in Vienna, Austria and 
came to the U.S. in 1947.  

My mother, Ida died in 1983 but was buried in San Francisco, not in 
Israel.

My father died in 1986 and was buried in Los Angeles.


If you have any more information about my family tree I would greatly 
appreciate it.



Best regards,

Hi,

Thanks so much for your response. I do have some more data on your 
family. Firstly, via Mayer's death records, we found that his father 
(your great-grandfather) was named Israel. Also, I still have some 
loose ends. There is a Henderson connection that I have not been able 
to pin down. Some descendents own a restaurant of sorts in California. 

I would like to follow up more on your branch. Do you know more about 
your father's first family that perished? Any names or old pictures? 
Do you know any detail on your own grandfather? Did your uncle Mendel 
have any children? If so, do you have the name or address of a person 
I can contact in their tree to try and fill in some more? 

Do you know any more about Chaim's siblings or other Langsam's that 
you know are related to you, even if you do not know how? Any detail 
on Israel, Chaim's father?

Thanks so much for your response and time,
Moishe

Dear Moishe--


Thank you so much for the family tree information.


As to your questions:


I am born in San Francisco in 1949.


I think that the Hendersons are spelled Henersons.  There are two relatives, 
Stanley and James who live in California.  Their parents were Morris and 
Gladys Henerson.  Morris died several years ago.  I don't know about Gladys.
My uncle, Mendel had no children and was never married.


Also my father, Mark Langsam had 2 daughters who died in the holocaust but 
they were born before 1942.


My mother, Ida Langsam's maiden name was Goldwater.  Her first husband's last 
name was Diller.  He also died in the holocaust.


I don't have much more information but would greatly appreciate more 
information about the Langsam family tree.


Best regards,

Charley Langsam

Hi,

Thanks again for the feedback. I can try to get you a copy of the original book published in 1986. Also, can you tell me how Morris and Gladys Henerson were related to you? IF not, can you put me in touch with someone that knows more about them?

Thanks!
Moishe

Hi


Gladys Henerson was my father's (Mark's) first cousin.  She was married to 
Morris Henerson who dies a few years ago.


Best regards and thanks for all the family tree information.

Thanks. As an FYI, from the Social Security Death Index, I find one entry:
MORRIS HENERSON 
  SSN 117-10-7856 Residence:  94612  Oakland, Alameda, CA 
  Born 28 Oct 1906 Last Benefit:    
  Died Oct 1985 Issued:  NY (Before 1951) 

I will try and track them down to find out which sibling of your grandfather they come from. I will keep you posted. I really appreciate your patience with me. 

Also, Marti Ann Schwartz, a cousin of yours, asked that if I ever "find" you, to let her know. In deference to your privacy, would you like me to, or would you prefer not? To make it easy for you, if you do not respond, I will assume you prefer that I do not.

Be well!
Moishe

Dear Moishe


I would very much like to know the connection with my grandfather and Gladys 
Henerson (She was married to Morris Henerson and is the Langsam cousin.)


It is ok for you to give my e-mail address to Marti Schwartz.  She can  get 
in touch with you.  


Thank you for all your work and information about the Langsam family tree.


Stay well and  best regards,

Charley Langsam
