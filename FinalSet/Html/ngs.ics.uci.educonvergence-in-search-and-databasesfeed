		<description><![CDATA[Just a few thoughts:

I looked at the Flamenco search project started by Marti Hearst (http://flamenco.berkeley.edu/). But from what I gather by looking at the demos, it looks like the idea is very similar to Google Base. The last time I looked at Google Base, they seemed to support something which is very similar to what Marti calls facets in Flamenco. 

I guess what is interesting about Flamenco is the ability to quickly expose your database directly via an interesting web UI with minimum configuration (a .csv file describing facets and a couple of other things is all that it takes).

Cheers,
Harish]]></description>
