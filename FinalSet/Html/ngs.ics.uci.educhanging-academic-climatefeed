		<description><![CDATA[I hear for the first time  that the amount of foreign students( namely  India  and China) has been decreased. What are the reasons, can you please enlighten me? On the other hand I do not  think that  even if it is so, it will affect the innnovation process in the US.   Maybe reduction of graduate students&#039; flow  is a temporary sign and  the country has  other sources of &quot; golden &quot;brains for innovative ideas. Thanks again.]]></description>
