		<description><![CDATA[A pretty thought provoking piece, Professor Jain. I love India as well and if the mind set of the country as a whole does not change we&#039;re going to continue to see religion used as an excuse to impede progress. 

However I would not juxtapose China and India or quite frankly China with any other country. I&#039;d rather embrace religion and deal with horrendous conditions at the Mumbai and Delhi airports than live in a suppressed society with &quot;big brother&quot; watching over me 24/7.

However I do appreciate your point - South Korea or Japan perhaps would be a fair comparison IMO.]]></description>
