		<description><![CDATA[&quot;And it is these reforms that I am not sure will take place soon.&quot;

Of course they won&#039;t. India will continue to grow organically and reforms such as these can only be sold to the electorate by a nationally popular, charismatic leader - something that India sorely misses right now.

On another note, I disagree that Indians are &#039;painfully aware&#039;. I think &#039;comically aware&#039; perhaps more apt. Indians (like me) know that reform is necessary and yet, they know (like I do) that they&#039;ll be virtually impossible to implement. This irony amuses us all and even motivates us to take more adventurous journeys.]]></description>
