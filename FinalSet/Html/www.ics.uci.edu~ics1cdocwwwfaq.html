This is an introduction to the World Wide Web project, describing the
concepts, software and access methods.  It is aimed at people who know
a little about navigating the Internet, but want to know more about
WWW specifically.  If you don't think you are up to this level, try an
introductory Internet book such as Ed Krol's "The Whole Internet"
or "EFF's Guide to the Internet". The latter is available
electronically by anonymous FTP from

<H1>3: Elementary questions</H1>
<H2><A NAME="www-hypertext">3.1: What are WWW, hypertext and hypermedia?</A></H2>

WWW stands for "World Wide Web".  The WWW project, started by <A
HREF="http://info.cern.ch/">CERN</A> (the European Laboratory for
Particle Physics), seeks to build a distributed hypermedia system.<P>
<P>
The advantage of hypertext is that in a hypertext document, if you
want more information about a particular subject mentioned,
you can usually "just click on it" to read further detail. In fact,
documents can be and often are linked to other documents by completely
different authors -- much like footnoting, but you can get the
referenced document instantly!
<P>
To access the web, you run a <A
HREF="#introuser">browser
program</A>.  The browser reads documents, and can fetch documents
from other sources.  Information providers set up <A
HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/Overview.html">hypermedia
servers</A> which browsers can get documents from.<P>

The browsers can, in addition, access files by <A
HREF="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu:80/ftp-interface.html">FTP</A>, <A
HREF="news:*">NNTP (the Internet news protocol)</A>, <A
HREF="gopher://gopher.micro.umn.edu:70/11/Information%20About%20Gopher">gopher</A>
and <A
HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/DataSources/ByAccess.html">an
ever-increasing range of other methods</A>.  On top of these, if the
server has search capabilities, the browsers will permit <A
HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/Products/WAIS/Overview.html">searches
of documents and databases</A>.<P>

The documents that the browsers display are hypertext documents.
Hypertext is text with pointers to other text.  The browsers let you
deal with the pointers in a transparent way -- select the pointer, and
you are presented with the text that is pointed to. <P>

Hypermedia is a superset of hypertext -- it is any medium with
pointers to other media.  This means that browsers might not display a
text file, but might display images or sound or animations.  <P>
<A HREF="#contents"><em>(Up to Table of Contents)</em></A>

<H2><A NAME="url">3.2: What is a URL?</A></H2>

URL stands for "Uniform Resource Locator".  It is a draft standard for
<A
HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Addressing/Addressing.html">specifying
an object on the Internet</A>, such as a file or newsgroup.  <P>

URLs look like this: (file: and ftp: URLs are synonymous.) 
<UL>
<LI> file://wuarchive.wustl.edu/mirrors/msdos/graphics/gifkit.zip
<LI> ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/mirrors
<LI> http://info.cern.ch:80/default.html 
<LI> news:alt.hypertext
<LI> telnet://dra.com
</UL><P>

The first part of the URL, before the colon, specifies the access
method.  The part of the URL after the colon is interpreted specific
to the access method.  In general, two slashes after the colon
indicate a machine name (machine:port is also valid).  
<P>
When you are told to "check out this URL", what to do next
depends on your browser; please check the help for your
particular browser. For the line-mode browser at CERN,
which you will quite possibly use first via telnet,
the command to try a URL is "GO URL" (substitute the
actual URL of course). In Lynx you just select the
"GO" link on the first page you see; in graphical
browsers, there's usually an "Open URL" option in the menus.
<P>
<A HREF="#contents"><em>(Up to Table of Contents)</em></A>
<H2><A NAME="sgmlhtml">3.3: What are SGML and HTML?</A></H2>
Documents on the World Wide Web are written in a simple
"markup language" called HTML, which stands for
Hypertext Markup Language. See <A HREF="#prodhtml">
section 5.3</A> for more information about creating
HTML documents for use on the web.
<P>
SGML is a much broader language which is used to define
particular markup languages for particular purposes.
HTML is just a specific application of SGML.
You can learn more about SGML, and the rationale behind
HTML, by reading A Gentle Introduction to SGML (URL is
<A HREF="http://etext.virginia.edu/bin/tei-tocs?div=DIV1%26id=SG">
 http://etext.virginia.edu/bin/tei-tocs?div=DIV1%26id=SG </A>),
a document provided by the Text Encoding Initiative. 
(<em>Note:</em> Some browsers apparently crash on this URL.
There's nothing wrong with the document; try another browser
if you have problems.)
<P>
<A HREF="#contents"><em>(Up to Table of Contents)</em></A>
<H2><A NAME="compare">3.4: How does WWW compare to gopher and WAIS?</A></H2>

While all three of these information presentation systems are
client-server based, they differ in terms of their model of data.  In
gopher, data is either a menu, a document, an index or a telnet
connection.  In WAIS, everything is an index and everything that is
returned from the index is a document.  In WWW, everything is a
(possibly) hypertext document which may be searchable.<P>

In practice, this means that WWW can represent the gopher (a menu is a
list of links, a gopher document is a hypertext document without
links, searches are the same, telnet sessions are the same) and WAIS
(a WAIS index is a searchable page, returning a document with no
links) data models as well as providing extra functionality.<P>

World Wide Web usage grew far beyond Gopher usage in the
last few months, according to the statistics-keepers of the Internet backbone.
(Of course, World Wide Web browsers can also access Gopher
servers, which inflates the numbers for the latter.)
WWW has long since reached critical mass, with new
commercial and noncommercial sites appearing daily.<P>
<A HREF="#contents"><em>(Up to Table of Contents)</em></A>
<H2><A NAME="books">3.5: Are there books about the web?</A></H2>
<P>
Yes, quite a few. A brief list follows. <em>New entries are solicited.</em>

<H2><A NAME="introuser">4.1: Introduction: how can I access the web?</A></H2>

You have three options: use a browser on your own machine
(the best option), use a browser that can be telnetted to
(not as good), or access the web by email (the least
attractive, but for some it's the only way).
It is always best to run a browser
on your own machine, unless you absolutely cannot do so; but feel
free to telnet to a browser for your first look at the web, or
use email if the telnet command does not work on your system
(<em>try it first!</em>). Note that "your machine" can be
defined as a system you dial into from home, such as netcom or
another account provider. Running a text-based browser on such a
system is still preferable to telnetting to a faraway site.
<P>
<A NAME="webbymail">
The following sections cover telnetting to a browser and
obtaining your own browser; if neither of these are possible
for you (because you have only an email-and-news connection
to the Internet), here is how to access a web page by email:
</A>
<P>
Send email to <code>server@mail.w3.org</code> (preferred) or to 
<code>listserv@info.cern.ch</code> (older address if the first fails) 
containing the following single line. (What you put on the subject line
doesn't matter; blank is OK. This line should go in the text
of the message.) You will receive as a reply a simple page intended 
to help you learn more about the Web.

SlipKnot is the only graphical WWW browser that operates
entirely without SLIP, PPP, an Ethernet connection, or
special server-side software
(but consider <A HREF="#tia">TIA, section 4.12</a> for another
workaround). SlipKnot supports multiple fonts, inline
images, and review of documents you have already received
while new documents arrive, and it operates entirely
through your regular Unix shell account. SlipKnot does
<strong>not</strong> require that you install any new
software on your Unix shell account. (However, it is lacking
certain important features as a result, such as forms
and validation; this will keep you from accessing some web pages.
SlipKnot does support the &lt;ISINDEX> tag, which many sites
support as a simpler alternative to forms.)
You can obtain SlipKnot by anonymous FTP from ftp.netcom.com

A "proxy server" is a specialized HTTP server which (typically) runs on a firewall 
machine, providing access to the outside world for people inside the
firewall.  <A HREF="http://info.cern.ch/httpd">The CERN httpd</A> can be
configured to run as a proxy.  Furthermore, it is able to perform
caching of documents, resulting in faster response times. <P>

For information on using NCSA Mosaic from behind a firewall, please
read the following. In general, browsers can be made useful behind
firewalls through the use of a package called "SOCKS"; the source
must be modified slightly and rebuilt to accommodate this. Whenever
possible, work <em>with</em> your network administrators
to solve the problem, not against them.

An excerpt from the NCSA Mosaic FAQ:

4.7: How can I get sound from the PC speaker with WinMosaic?</A></H2>
<P>
This piece of wisdom donated by Hunter Monroe:

<P>
This section explains how to install sound on a PC which already has
a working version of Mosaic for Microsoft Windows.  Be warned in
advance that the results may be poor.
<P>
To get Mosaic to produce sound out of the PC speaker, first, you
need a driver for the speaker.  You can <A HREF="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/SPEAK.EXE">get the Microsoft speaker driver</A>
from the URL ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/SPEAK.EXE
or by doing an Archie search to find it somewhere else. 
SPEAK.EXE is a self-extracting file.  Copy the speak.exe file to
a new directory, and then type "SPEAK" at the DOS prompt.  Do not
put the file SPEAKER.DRV in a separate directory from OEMSETUP.INF.
<P>
Now, you need to install the driver.  In Windows, from the
Program Manager choose successively Main/Control
Panel/Drivers/Add/Unlisted or updated drivers/(enter path of
SPEAK.EXE)/PC Speaker.  At this point some strange sounds
come out as the driver is initialized.  Change the settings to
improve the sound quality on the various sounds: tada, chimes,
etc.  Click OK when you are finished and choose the Restart
windows option.
<P>
Having installed the speaker driver, you will now get sounds
whenever you start Windows, make a mistake, or exit Windows.  If
you do not want this, from the Main/Control
Panel/Sounds menu, make sure there is no X next to "Enable System
Sounds."
<P>
Now, you need a sound viewer program that Mosaic can call to
display sounds.  NCSA unfortunately recommend WHAM, which does
not work well with a PC speaker.  Get the program WPLANY instead.
You can find a copy nearby with an Archie search on the string
"wplny"; the current version is WPLNY09B.ZIP. For details on
archie and other basic issues related to FTP, please read
the Usenet newsgroup <A HREF="news:news.announce.newusers">
news.announce.newusers</A>.
<P>
Move the zip file to a new directory, and use an unzip program
like pkunzip to unzip it, producing the files WPLANY.EXE and
WPLANY.DOC.  Then edit the MOSAIC.INI file to remove the "REM"
before the line "TYPE9=audio/basic".  Then, you need lines in the
section below that read something like:
audio/basic="c:\wplany\wplany.exe %ls"
audio/wav="c:\wplany\wplany.exe %ls"
where you have filled in the correct path for wplany.exe.  The
MOSAIC.INI file delivered with Mosaic may have NOTEPAD.EXE on the
audio/basic line, but this will not work.  Now, restart Mosaic,
and you should now be able to produce sounds.  To check this,
with Mosaic choose File/Local File/\WINDOWS\*.WAV and then try
to play TADA.WAV.  Then, you might try the Mosaic Demo document
for some .AU sounds, but you are lucky if your speaker produces
something you can understand.

<H2><A NAME="nowais">4.8: I have a Windows PC or Macintosh. Why can't
I access WAIS URLs?</A></H2>
<P>
This answer provided by Michael Grady (m-grady@uiuc.edu):
<P>
   The version of Mosaic for X has "wais client" code built-in to it. This
   was relatively easy for the developers to do, because there was already
   a set of library routines for talking to WAIS available for Unix as
   "public domain" (freeWAIS). I don't think there is such a library of
   routines for PC/Windows or Mac, which would make it much more difficult
   for the Mosaic versions for Windows and the Mac to add "wais client"
   capability. Therefore, at least for now, neither the Windows or Mac
   versions of Mosaic support direct query of a WAIS server (i.e. can act
   as wais clients themselves).

4.9: I'm running XMosaic. Why can't I get external viewers working...</A></H2>
... No matter what no matter what I do to my
.mailcap and .mime.types files?
<P>
Answer provided by Ronald E. Daniel (rdaniel@acl.lanl.gov):
<blockquote>
<P>
Mosaic only looks at the .mime.types file if it has no idea what the
document's type is. This is actually a very rare situation. Essentially
all servers now use the HTTP/1.0 protocol, which means that they tell
Mosaic (or other browsers) what the document's MIME Content-type is. The
servers use a file very much like Mosaic's .mime.types file to infer the
Content-type from the filename's extension.
<P>
It is pretty simple to find out if this really is the problem. Use telnet to
talk to the server and find out if it is assigning a MIME type to the
document in question. Here's an example, looking at the home page for my
server. (idaknow: is my shell prompt)
<pre>
  idaknow: telnet www.acl.lanl.gov 80  // Connect to the httpd server
  Trying 128.165.148.3 ...
  Connected to www.acl.lanl.gov.
  Escape character is '^]'.
  HEAD /Home.html  HTTP/1.0             // replace Home.html  with your document
                                       // you supply the blank line
  HTTP/1.0 200 OK                      // the rest of this comes from the server  Date: Wednesday, 25-May-94 19:18:11 GMT
  Server: NCSA/1.1
  MIME-version: 1.0
  Content-type: text/html              // Here's the MIME Content-type
  Last-modified: Monday, 16-May-94 16:21:58 GMT
  Content-length: 1727

  Connection closed by foreign host.
  idaknow: 
</pre>
In the example above, /Home.html  will get http://www.acl.lanl.gov/Home.html .
<P>

Normally servers will be configured to supply a Content-type of text/plain
if they don't know what else to do. If this is the problem you are having,
take a look at the 
<A HREF="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/setup/httpd/TypesConfig.html"> 
TypesConfig documentation</A> for
<A HREF="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/Overview.html"> 
NCSA's httpd</A>.
You can have the server look at the filename extension, supply the
correct Content-type, then use your local .mailcap file to tell Mosaic
what viewer to use to look at the document.
</blockquote>
Russ Segal adds:
<blockquote>
The answer from Ronald Daniel is essentially correct, but it needs a
small addendum.
<P>
When starting Moasic, you can specify a "fileProxy" which will fetch
files for you:
<P>
    <code>"*fileProxy: http://socks/"</code>
<P>
If you do this, file: URLs are no longer strictly local accesses.  So
even if the URL is not fttp:, the proxy server must be upgraded as Mr.
Daniel suggests.

4.10: Hey, I know, I'll write a WWW-exploring robot! Why not?</A></H2>
Programs that automatically traverse the web can be quite useful,
but have the potential to make a serious mess of things. Robots
have been written which do a "breadth-first" search of the web,
exploring many sites in a gradual fashion instead of aggressively 
"rooting out" the pages of one site at a time. Some of these
robots now produce excellent indexes of information available
on the web.
<P>
But others have written simple depth-first searches which,
at the worst, can bring servers to their knees in minutes
by recursively downloading information from CGI script-based
pages that contain an infinite number of possible links.
(Often robots can't realize this!) Imagine what happens
when a robot decides to "index" the CONTENTS of several
hundred mpeg movies. Shudder.

4.11: How do I send newsgroup posts in HTML to my web client?</A></H2>
How to do this depends greatly on your system; if you have a Mac
or Windows system, the answer is completely different. But, as
food for thought, here is a simple shell script I use on my Unix
account to send posts from rn and related newsreaders to 
<A HREF="#lynx">Lynx</A>. Put this text in the file
"readwebpost" and use the "chmod" command to make it executable,
then put it somewhere in your path (such as your personal
bin directory):
<PRE>
#!/bin/sh
echo \&lt;PRE\> > .article.html 
cat >> .article.html 
echo \&lt;/PRE\> >> .article.html 
lynx .article.html  &lt; /dev/tty
rm .article.html 
</PRE>
Then add the following line to your .rnmac file (create it if you
don't already have one):
<PRE>
W     |readwebpost %C
</PRE>
Now, when you press "W" while reading a post in rn, a message will be sent to 
Lynx, and the links enclosed in it will be live. 
<P>
Larry W. Virden provides the following version which invokes Mosaic
instead, and is also capable of communicating with an already-running
copy of Mosaic instead of launching another. (You can use the same
rn macro as above, invoking "goto-xm" instead of "readwebpost".)
Read the comments for details on the assumptions made by the script.

HTML is the simple markup system used to create hypertext
documents. There are three ways to produce HTML documents:
writing them yourself, which is not a very difficult
skill to acquire, using an HTML editor, which assists
in doing the above, and converting documents in other
formats to HTML. The following three sections cover these
possibilities in sequence.

The following response to this very-frequently-asked-question was provided
by Mike Meyer (mwm@contessa.phone.net).
<blockquote>
The answer is "It depends." What it depends on is what kind of things
you want to provide on your server. Here are some rules of thumb to
use when deciding what kind of connection you need for your server.
<P>
The first rule of thumb is:
<P>
<strong>Don't worry about simultaneous access.</strong>
<P>
Unless you have a very large site, simultaneous access is not a
problem. If you have a very large site, you need as much bandwidth as
you can afford. There is a bit more about this below.
<P>
The second rule of thumb is:
<P>
<strong>It should take at most 5 seconds to send a page.</strong>
<P>
The five second rule dates from command line days, when that was about
how long people would wait before getting impatient with the system.
It seems like a reasonable number to use now.
<P>
Since external images/audio/etc. are somewhat exceptional, allow more
time for them. If you think they should have the same restrictions as
above, buy the bandwidth your site will need to do so. However, the
rule of thumb for external images/audio/etc is:
<P>
<strong>It should take at most 30 seconds to send an external file.</strong>
<P>
Given these rules, it's pretty straightforward to work out how large
an HTML page and external files can be. At least, it's easy after you
simplify things by ignoring IP overhead on the line, compression on
modem lines, and anything that's less than 10% of the total (or even a
little bit more than 10%).
<P>
The one simplification not to ignore is the multiple packet
round-trips it takes to get data flowing through an HTTP channel. For
modem lines, this is nearly a second for each HTTP connection, which
is significant. For leased lines, it's more like .1 or .2 seconds,
which is not significant.
<P>
On a 14.4 line assumed to be sending 1.4K bytes of data/second, with a
1 second startup, you get 4 * 1.4 or 5.6K of HTML. If you want to
include a single inline image, that's 2 seconds of startup, so you're
down to 3 * 1.4 or 4.2K of HTML + image. This means smallish HTML
pages, and simple inline images. For external files, you get 29 * 1.4
or 40K, which is still a small image. If you have a 28.8 line, you get
to double those figures; for a 9600 line, figure 2/3rds of that size.
<P>
On a 56K leased line assumed to be sending 5K/second, you get 25K of
HTML, or mixed HTML/data. For external images, it's 150K. That should
cover any reasonable HTML document, and small to medium external
files. An MPEG movie might be a bit much.
<P>
With a T1 line assumed to be sending 150K/second, you get 750K of
HTML, or 4.5 megabytes in an external file. Barring very large
animations, this should be sufficient for anything you want to serve.
More would be faster, but it also gets drastically more expensive.
<P>
Given the above guidelines, let's look at simultaneous access again.
Under the worst case conditions, you're using all of your line for
HTML pages, each of which takes 5 seconds to send, so your server is
sending 12 pages a minute, or 720 pages an hour, or 17,000 pages a day
(pages, not accesses; each inline image in a page generates an access,
unless the client cached it). This makes you one of the busier sites
on the web. While you'll have contention problems before you get to
this point, anything but a modem connection will be sending most pages
in a small fraction of five seconds, which should leave plenty of
bandwidth with no contention.  If you have this kind of access rates
on a modem line, you should seriously consider upgrading your
connection.
<P>
The bottom line on simultaneous access is that the WWW server is more
likely to have contention with other uses of the line than with
itself. Since I don't know what else you use your line for, I can't factor 
it in. You'll have to consider that issue yourself.

<H3><A NAME="imagemap">5.7.1: How do I set up a clickable image map?</A></H3>
<P>
There are really two issues here: how to indicate in HTML that
you want an image to be clickable, and how to configure your
server to do something with the clicks returned by Mosaic,
Chimera, and other clients capable of delivering them.
<P>
You can read about <A HREF="

image maps and the NCSA server at the URL
http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/setup/admin/Imagemap.html .</A>
<P>
Using imagemaps requires that you create a map file; you can do
this by hand or with a WYSIWYG tool. 
<P>
<strong>VERY IMPORTANT:</strong> Creating imagemaps requires a real
web server (not an FTP server) and a cooperative web server administrator. 
It is not usually as simple
as wrapping a link around an IMG SRC tag and adding the ISMAP directive;
the server must also be told about the map file, and the way to accomplish
this varies from server to server. So read your server documentation,
and don't waste time making maps before making 
sure you have the necessary tools to deliver them.

HTTP now supports a response code of 204, which is no operation. Some
browsers such as Mosaic/X 2.* support it. To use it, make your script a nph
script and output an HTTP/1.0 204 header. Something like:
<P>
<CODE>
HTTP/1.0 204 No response
Server: Myscript/NCSA httpd 1.1
</CODE>
<P>
(You can learn more about nph scripts from the 
<A HREF="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs">NCSA server documentation</A>
at the URL http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs.) Essentially they
are scripts that handle their own HTTP response codes.

Writing an HTML form is easy, but the form doesn't accomplish anything
until you write a CGI program to interpret the results on the
server side! For more information, see

Use <code>INPUT TYPE=hidden</code>. An example:

&lt;INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=state VALUE="hidden info to be returned with form">
</PRE>
By now, most browsers can handle the hidden type, but understand
that some browsers will fail to hide the field (and probably
confuse the user). Note that "hidden" doesn't mean "secret"; the user can 
always click on "view source".

5.7.3.2: How can users send me email through their browsers?</A></H4>
There are two ways:

<DD>
You can simply create a link which looks like this:
<P>
&lt;A HREF="mailto:me@my.address">Send Me Mail&lt;/A>

This works great for browsers that support the mailto: URL. Perhaps
80% of web users will be able to use such a link. But not
all browsers support it.
<P>
<DT>Installing an email form
<DD>
If you have access to the server's configuration files, or if your
server administrator permits users to create their own CGI scripts,
you can create a form which sends mail to you from any browser
that supports forms. I've written a simple 
<A HREF="http://siva.cshl.org/email/index.html">email forms package
(URL is: http://siva.cshl.org/email/index.html )</A>,
which does it in ANSI C. There is also a package written
in Perl, known as the <a href="http://www.mps.ohio-state.edu/mailto/mailto_info.html">

Use the &lt;!-- tag at the beginning of EACH line commented out;
close this for EACH line with the --> tag. Note that comments
do not nest, and the sequence "--" may not appear inside a
comment except as part of the closing --> tag. (It's officially
allowed, but some browsers won't handle it properly.) 
<P>
You should <strong>not</strong> try to use this to "comment out"
HTML that would otherwise be shown to the user, since some

<H3><A NAME="htmltables">
5.7.5: How can I create decent-looking tables and stop using &lt;PRE>...
&lt;/PRE>?</A></H3>
Tables are a standard feature in <A HREF="#htmlplus">HTML Level 3</A>, a 
new version of HTML. Unfortunately, they are at present 
implemented only
by the latest NCSA Mosaic versions and the <A HREF="#viola">Viola</A> and 
<A HREF="#emacsw3">Emacs-W3</A>
browsers, to my knowledge. In addition, most implementations are
incomplete. In some implementations, at the time of this writing, text in 
tables cannot be selected and/or cannot be a link.
<P>
<em>However</em>, there is a way to use HTML Level 3 tables now and
convert them automatically to HTML, allowing you to design
proper tables and install those pages directly when 
table support arrives in the majority of clients.
You can do this using the <A HREF="
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/packages/infosystems/WWW/tools/html+tables.shar">
html+tables package</A>, by Brooks Cutter (bcutter@paradyne.com),
which is available for anonymous ftp from sunsite.unc.edu in
the directory pub/packages/infosystems/WWW/tools/html+tables.shar.
This package requires the shell language Perl, which is primarily
used on Unix systems but is also available for other systems
(such as MSDOS machines). html+tables accepts HTML Level 3 and outputs
html using the &lt;PRE>...&lt;/PRE> construct to represent tables,
allowing you to write HTML Level 3 now, knowing that it will look
better when clients are ready for it.

<A HREF="#contents"><em>(Up to Table of Contents)</em></A>
<H3><A NAME="htmlplus">
5.7.6: What is HTML Level 3 and where can I learn more about it?</A></H3>
HTML Level 3, also known as HTML+, is an enhanced version of 
HTML designed to address some of the limitations of HTML. HTML Level 3 
supports true <A HREF="#htmltables">tables</A>, right-justified text, 
centered text, line breaks that do not double space, and many other 
desired features.
<P>
However, most clients support only a handful of HTML Level 3 features
(such as the partial implementation of tables in Mosaic) at the time
of this writing. If you have access to a Unix system with the
X Window System installed, you can try out many features of
HTML Level 3 using the experimental <A HREF="#browsersarena">

<H3><A NAME="transparent">5.7.7: How can I make transparent and interlaced GIFs? And what are they?</A></H3>
Transparent GIFs are useful because they appear to blend in smoothly
with the user's display, even if the user has set a background
color that differs from that the developer expected. They do this
by assigning one color to be transparent -- if the web browser
supports transparency, that color will be replaced by the browser's
background color, whatever it may be.
<P>
Interlaced GIFs appear first with poor resolution and then improve
in resolution until the entire image has arrived, as opposed to
arriving linearly from the top row to the bottom row. This is great
to get a quick idea of what the entire image will look like while
waiting for the rest. This doesn't do much for you if your web
browser doesn't support progressive display as the image is downloaded,
but non-progressive-display web browsers will still display
interlaced GIFs once they have arrived in their entirety.
<P>
To create transparent and interlaced GIFs, check out
David Koblas' <A HREF="http://www.homepages.com/tools/">giftool</A>,
a program which can manipulate those options and many more
aspects of your GIF file.

JPEG does a better job with realistic images such as scanned

so you must link to them as external images (using a regular
&lt;A HREF...> instead of &lt;IMG SRC...>).

GIF does a better job with crisp, sharp images, such as those
