		<description><![CDATA[When compared with all the other sciences, Computer Science and IT were just recently recognized for their importance in complementing different study fields. But today, it is clearly one of the most challenging research areas. Although computers are the most visible feature of computer science, it wouldnâ€™t be accurate to characterize it as dealing only with machinery. For that matter, a more comprehensive definition would be the study of computation, which includes information processing from designing and analyzing algorithms to the development of computational devices and execution of those programs. Having this kind of expanded knowledge could benefit the accuracy of results in research processes for new technologies and its holistic analysis. Nevertheless, computing strategies must operate along with high performance machinery. Since the organization depends on computers, it is essential to have a reliable provider of technology solutions. I would recommend a consultation with Ask Dr. Tech. Their professionals can provide the best IT solutions, any place at any time. Their work relies on outsource services and remote operations, which are clearly required at any government instance.]]></description>
