     with the subject line "Travel grant application for PPoPP'13", stating that you are a full-time student pursuing an 
     MS/Ph.D. or undergraduate research in the areas covered by PPoPP.

<ul>
<li> For students, the confirmation email from their advisors must be received by the same deadline.
<li> Due to the large number of applications we expect to receive, we will NOT solicit letters from your advisors. It is YOUR 
     responsibility to ensure that your advisor sends the email before the deadline. No exception will be made for any reason.
</ul>
<li> We will do our best to notify you about the status of your application before the conference early registration deadline. 
     Note that award decisions will be made based on funding availability.
