		<description><![CDATA[Local method of story telling is not an art. But what is getting really art, That are from the artist. They made it Artful and meaningful to rest of us.  I salute them and for this i am giving red salute to Mr. Ramesh..!

Thank You,

		<description><![CDATA[Coming to the other extreme â€“ big data. That is not a story. That is just a context-less bunch of data. To tell stories here, the only closest one can get is data visualization. A picture can tell a story without using 1000 words, right!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank for your thoughts on stories. Stories inspire me a lot in my scientific work as a vehicle of social contacts in social networks...

For me story is a representation of an event. Repeating events produce many similar stories to which can later be given nice literal form, resulting in meta-stories (or meta-stories recognized there). 

I see &quot;extreme stories&quot; as moments where storytelling evolves rapidly due to new technologies and resulting socio-psychological upgrades. We have platforms to share every ordinary event (FB, Twitter, ...), we have technologies to automatically record events (logs in every possible digitized social systems, from phone usage to beeps unlocking gateways). And we have new technologies to handle resulting big data and observe events on mass scale and tell stories about. We can than imagine real-time observation of events with automatic sensors of of predefined changes in pattern. We can automatically observe moment when people synchronize to tell the same story together, which is groundbreaking fact in my opinion.

# PS: Keep blogging, it is hard to gain insight from tweets/updates only :]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My thought outlines post reading- 

#big data - Human beings have the limitation of life time (a limiting constant)  and anything that takes space to exist will not remain infinite to them (information storage media in this case).. It will be limited to the radius of the sphere a person can travel in space in his/her lifetime (unless living/born in the space)

#video (out of topic) - visual representation of text - examples - video resumes with annotations (space (storage) - cognition (ease of understanding) optimization). The five sense organs gather data  with different incoming dataspeeds.  mechanisms to store /retrieve information need upgradation (eg like synapses). our body is the best example of parallel and simultaneous data computation and management. &quot;small (tiny data) is quick but large(big data) is clear&quot;.

#question to ponder - how much data space and processing power will be needed to model the real world and get predictive responses in realtime? (making a graph of everything.. jsut like open graph concept of facebook)]]></description>
