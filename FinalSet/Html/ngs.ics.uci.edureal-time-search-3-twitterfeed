		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll admit that, for the longest time, I was exasperated by the Twitter hype. Like the world needs ANOTHER ego-massaging, social-networking time drain? Between e-mail and blogs and Web sites and Facebook and chat and text messages, who on earth has the bandwidth to keep interrupting the day to visit a Web site and type in, &quot;I&#039;m now having lunch&quot;? And to read the same stuff being broadcast by a hundred other people?

Then my eyes were opened. A few months ago, I was one of 12 judges for a MacArthur grant program in Chicago. As we looked over one particular application, someone asked, &quot;Hasn&#039;t this project been tried before?&quot;

Everyone looked blankly at each other.

Then the guy sitting next to me typed into the Twitter box. He posed the question to his followers. Within 30 seconds, two people replied, via Twitter, that it had been done before. And they provided links.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ramesh,
I agree with you that Twitter can be very exciting and would like to add that you need to do it properly (in fact I haven&#039;t been able to figure it out yet). What I have noticed though is if you&#039;re blasting out a tweet you want to do it at a time when most people are logged into their Twitter account. Otherwise, your message gets buried among all the other tweets that come in.
