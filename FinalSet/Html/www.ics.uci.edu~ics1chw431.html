<H2>Introduction:</H2>
     In 1981, the <a href ="http://www.microsoft.com/default.htm"><img 
src= "http://www.microsoft.com/library/images/gifs/general/home.gif"></a> 
Corporation introduced the Microsoft 
Disk Operating System ("MS-DOS") for the PC.  This operating system is 
designed to be used with a specific PC microprocessor <img src 
="http://web.jf.intel.com:80/procs/penticn.gif">, the "brain" of the 
computer which controls the operation of a computer by coordinating the 
interaction between the computer's microprocessor, memory, and 
peripherals (i.e. attatched devices such as monitors, disk drives, and 
printers.)  In a sense, the PC operating system functions as the "central 
nervous system" of the computer.  The computer cannot function without 
it.  Most of the computers in the world today utilize the <a href= 
"http://www.intel.com/index.html"><img src 
="http://www.intel.com/pix/home.gif"></a> designed x86 
class of 
microprocessors.  These x86 microprocessors do not only include Intel 
manufactured microprocessors (286, 386, 486, and Pentium) but also 
include microprocessors manufactured by other firms that are based on a 
similar architecture.  MS-DOS is the mainstream operating system used for 
these Intel and Intel-based microprocessors.  In addition to the 
operating system, applications are required for the computer to perform 
any useful task.  Applications are software programs that communicate 
with the operating system to allow the user to perform a variety of 
functions.  Application programs include word processors, spreadsheets, 
and database programs.  Each application is written for a particular 
operating system and incorporates the codes that allow the application to 
function within the operating system environment.  Microsoft manufactures 
and markets a number of its own very successful applications. <br>
<br>
In 1985 Microsoft introduced a graphical user interface operating system 
called Windows.   Windows allows the user to give commands to the 
operating system by pointing and clicking on a device called a "mouse" 
eliminating the need for the user to memorize complex commands.  In 
addition to simplifying the instruction process.  Windows also allows the 
user to run more than one application at one time.  To date, Microsoft 
estimates that over 50 million computers use Windows. <hr>
<br>
The marketing of the MS_DOS and Windows operating systems is one 
primarily through original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs").  OEMs 
manufacture PC's and sells them to consumers and businesses either 
directly or through resellers.  Some of the large OEMs would be <a href 
="http://www.ibm.com/">  IBM </a>, <a 
href ="//www.compaq.com/"> Compaq </a>, and <a href 
="http://www.dell.com/"> Dell </a>, all of which have agreements with 
Microsoft.  The MS-DOS operating system is generally distributed only 
to OEMs, with upgrades being offered to consumers.  Microsoft sold 80 
percent of its Windows units through OEMs.
<h2>The Complaint:</h2></a>
The <a href ="http://gopher.usdoj.gov/atr/complnt.html">complaint</a> from 
the Antitrust division of the Department of Justice 
listed certain points that concerned them as to Microsoft's domination of 
the market for operating systems.  First of all, the Department of 
Justice defined the relavant market and the monopoly power that Microsoft 
held.  Second, the Department of Justice listed the barriers to entry by 
new firms.  Third, the Dapartment of Justice stated the reasons why.  
Finally, the Department of Justice listed the anticompetitive effects of 
Microsoft's behavior. <br>
<br>
The relavant market was defined as the market for personal computer 
operating systems using the x86 class of microprocessors with the 
relavant geographic market being the world.  It is improtant to note that 
operating systems written for other microprocessors will not work on 
machines with the x86 class microprocessor, therefore OEMs who sell and 
customers who buy x86 machines cannot use other operating systems.  Since 
at least the mid-1980's, Microsoft has had a monopoly power in the 
relavant market due to their ability to maintain an extremely high market 
share in excess of 70 percent with MS-DOS installed on over 120 million 
PCs and Windows installed on over 50 million PCs worldwide.<br>
<br>
The next concern of the Department of Justice was the barriers to entry 
that faced new firms.  The first barrier to entry being the considrable 
time and expense required to develop, test, and market a new operating 
system.  Other barriers that face software developers are: 1) the absence 
of a variety of high quality applications that will run on a new 
operating system and the difficulty in convincing independant software 
vendors ("ISVs") to develop those applications. 2) The lack of a sizable 
installed base of users, and 3) The difficulty in convincing OEMs to 
offer and promote a non-Microsoft PC operating system, particularly one 
with a small user base and relatively few applications availible to run 
in it.  Because the value of an operating system to the consumer lies on 
the availibility of a variety of high quality applications that run on 
the system, and the number of users who are able to use and share 
information without additional training, these barriers to entry magnify 
and reinforce each other.  Due to this reasoning, software manufacturers 
tend to develop applications for operating systems with a large 
installed user base, and consumers tend to purchase operating systems 
with a large availibility of applications.<br>
<br>
The third concern of the Department of Justice was the anticometitive 
nature of Microsoft's marketing agreements.  The "per processor" licenses 
that Microsoft was issuing requires that OEMs pay a royalty for each 
computer the OEM sells containing a particular processor whether or not 
the OEM has installed a Microsoft operating system in that computer or 
not.  Because the profit margins in the computer industry are currently 
very thin, the OEM has the incentive to enter into these agreements with 
the reasoning being the ability to purchase the operating system at the 
lowest possible cost.  OEMs believe that they must install MS-DOS and 
Windows in their computers because of Microsoft's monopoly position in 
the marketplace.  Because the "per processor" contract penalizes the OEMs 
for inststalling a non-Microsoft operating system.  OEMs bound by the 
"per processor contract" are deterred from using sny competitive 
alternatives nto the Microsoft operating systems.  Another feature of the 
marketing agreements between Microsoft and the OEMs is the long term 
nature of these agreements.  Microsoft requires minimum commitments and 
credits unused balances to future contracts, which effectively lengthens 
the contract, even though the frequent contract duration of three years 
or more exceeds the product life cycle of most operating system 
products.  The credit to future contracts make the OEM wary of installing 
a non-Microsoft operating system.  Microsoft also often extends the term 
of the OEM licenses to beyond five years. <br>
<br>
By blocking acess to OEMs, Microsoft has taken away from competitors a 
critical point of entry.  The majority of PCs are sold through the large 
OEMs, all of which have "per processor" agreements with Microsoft.  Even 
if a competing operating system were to license itself to a smaller OEM 
that it not covered by Microsoft's "per processor" agreement, it would 
not be able to achieve any commercial success.  Thus a competing 
operating system must have access to large OEMs.<br>
<br>
Another type of agreement that Microsoft enters into are agreements with 
Independant Software Vendors ("ISVs").  ISVs develop applications and 
Microsoft has sought to restrict the ability of important ISVs to develop 
applications for competing operating systems by pursuing non-disclosure 
agreements.  The terms of these non-disclosure agreements prevent major 
ISV developers from working with other operating system developers and 
competing technologies for long periods of time.  ISVs enter into these 
agreements because they need access to Microsoft's beta tests with new 
products especially with the upcoming version of Windows, code named 
<a 
href 
="http://www.microsoft.com/pages/peropsys/win_news/chicago/wwwhtml/home/w95.htm><img 
src 
="http://www.microsoft.com/pages/peropsys/win_news/chicago/ms-www/smchic.gif">Chicago</a>, 
that will be released sometime in 1995.  The beta tests are 
conducted before the commercial release of the produuct so the ISVs can 
obtain critical information about the interfaces in the operating system 
that connect with applicartions - information which is necessary to write 
applications for that operating system.  It is important for Microsoft to 
conduct these "beta tests" not only for ISVs but for themselves as well.  
For Microsoft, the "beta tests" provide them with important feedback 
about the operating system.  Also, the sucess of the operating system 
depends on the availibility of applications and providing the ISVs with 
the "beta tests" insures that there can be a large availibility.<br>
<br>
Finally, the Department of Justice listed the effects of Microsoft's 
anticompetitive behavior.  According to the Department of Justice, 
Microsoft engaged in unlawful acts and practices that harmed competition, 
consumers, and innovation.  First of all, Microsoft contracts have 
excluded competitors on a basis other than the merits of their product.  
Second, Microsoft impedes the ability of rival operating systems to 
compete in the market by making it more difficult for competitors to 
convince OEMs to install their operating systems on their computers and 
to convince consumers that the system is a possible alternative to 
MS-DOS and Windows.  Third, the exclusionary license policy that 
Microsoft uses deprives competing operating systems of sales they might 
have been able to secure had they been able to develop a sufficient 
installation base through the OEM channel.<br>
<br>
The damage to competition by Microsoft's actions also harms consumers.  
Consumers that want a choice of operating systems may be forced to pay 
more since the OEM will have to pay a double royalty, one to Microsoft 
under the 'per processor' agreement and one to the competing operating 
systems manufacturer.  Thus Microsoft has limited the choices that 
consumers have with operating systems and applications.<br>
<h2>The Economics:</h2><br>
The reason why Microsoft can possibly gain monopoly power despite 
the availibility of competing products is because of the existence of 
<a href 
="http://www.rand.org/misc/rje/abstracts/abstracts/./1994/Autumn_1994._pp._382_401.html">network 
externalities. </a>  Network 
externalities can be defined as the 
benefits a product has as it emerges as a standard due to having a large 
user base.  In other words, the value of a particular product becomes 
higher as more users adopt products with the same technology.  The fast 
pace of technological change in computers and computer software has made 
consumers of one technology dependent on other technologies.  In the PC 
operating systems market, the success of a particular product is 
dependent on the complementary products availible that are compatible 
with that particular operating system.  Incompatibility creates a problem 
for consumers and competitors if network externalities exist by harming 
the ability of the user of a certain PC operating system to "swap" 
information with the user of the mainstream PC operating system as a well 
as preventing the user of the non-mainstream operating system from 
accessing the complementary applications and other resources of the 
mainstream PC operating system.<br>
<br>
Initial consumer demand hinges on the decision of the consumer to buy or 
not to buy the operating system.  However, the consumer usually would not 
make his choice when he purchases the computer.  The choice of the 
consumer will have an effect on purchases in future generations since the 
consumer will most likely demand a future improved unit later.  Thus, the 
'per processor' agreements with the major OEMs changes the popularity of 
Microsoft's MS-DOS and Windows operating system into a de facto standard 
by giving the OEM every incentive to install a Microsoft operating system 
and not to install the operating system of its competitors since the OEM 
must pay Microsoft regardless of whether or not it installed Microsoft's 
operating system on a computer.  This leads to the consumer automatically 
having a Microsoft operating system when they purchase the computer, 
thereby causing them to be more likely to upgrade their Microsoft product 
in future generations, whereas prices aside, the success of a PC 
operating system would otherwise depend on the technical capabilities of 
the product and whether or not future generations adopt the same PC 
operating system as well as the network effect.<br>
<br>
Though standardization by network effects benefits the consumer by 
setting technological standards for the consumer, it also hurts the 
consumer by eventually limiting their choices despite development of 
superior non-standardized products.  Furthermore, standardization created 
by Microsoft's agreements with the OEMs has a negative effect on 
competition in general.  Through it's agreements, Microsoft capitalized on 
a temporary popularity of its products and created a standard by using 
every method possible to deny their competitors the same sales 
outlets.<br>
<br>
<h2>The Response:</h2>
Though the complaint filed against Microsoft is well supported by the 
arguments made by the Department of Justice and by economic theories, 
certain legal conditions must be met in order to warant actions against 
Microsoft.  The Department of Justice asserts that Microsoft's marketing 
agreements violate Section 2 of the Sherman Act.  Microsoft's response to 
these claims has been to deny any wrongdoing and to claim insufficient 
grounds for an antitrust action.  Even many individuals outside of 
Microsoft that are familiar with the Personal Computer industry fail to 
see the basis for any action against Microsoft.<br>
<br>
Section 2 of the Sherman Act "prohibits monopolists from acquiring or 
maintaining power by blatantly illegal or uncompetitive acts."  This 
means that the market power a company develops must be the result of 
natural growth and that power cannot be used improperly to restrain 
competition.  In order for a company to be seenn as using its market 
power improperly, the Department of Justice must show that Microsoft has 
the willful intent to monopolize and the power to do so.  The problem 
with this is that there is no clear definition of monopoly power in 
Microsoft's case because the market structure has been blurred by the 
Department of Justice's establishment of numerous software segments (i.e. 
operating systems, applications, etc.)  Furthermore  any monopoly power 
that Microsoft might have could be argued as being the result of the 
insight of Bill Gates and the ability of his company to produce 
technologically superior products.  The lack of clarity in PC software 
market share also weakens the Department of Justice ability to show 
intent through leveraging, because it would require that the Department 
of Justice have strong evidence of high market share. <br>
<br>
Microsoft has complained that this action by the Department of Justice is 
aimed at taking away the success of an innovative company.  Cponcerning 
the "per processor" agreements with the OEMs, executives at Microsoft 
have insisted that these are optional bulk discounts and that Microsoft 
does not force OEMs to enter into these agreements.  Also Microsoft 
executives point out that consumers have equal access to competing 
products on the market as they do with Microsoft products.<br>
<br>
<h2> The Final Settlement </h2><br>
 On August 19, 1994, the Department of Justice and the Microsoft 
Corporation submitted a <a href 
="http://gopher.usdoj.gov/atr/microcis.html"> 
settlement agreement </a>to Federal Judge Stanley 
Sporkin for approval.  In the settlement agreement, the Microsoft 
Corporation agreed to change the 'per processor' agreements in to 'per 
system' agreements and reduce the length of its contracts to terms of one 
year.  Finally, the company agreed to limit the use of non-disclosure 
agreements for developers of its operating system products and permit 
computer manufacturers to renegotiate contract terms if they pleased.<br>
<br>
<h2> Why He Said No.. </h2><br>
Federal Judge Stanley Sporkin refused to approve the settlement agreement 
between the Department of Justice and the Microsoft Corporation for a 
number of reasons.  First, Judge Sporkin found that the Department of 
Justice did not provide the court with enough information for it to make 
a proper public interest determination.  Second, he found the scope of 
the settlement to be too narrow.  Third, he found that both the 
Department of Justice and the Microsoft Corporation have been unwilling 
to adequately address certain anticompetitive practices, and finally he 
found the settlement to be ineffective as a remedy for the complaint in 
that the mechanisms incorporated in the settlement for enforcement and 
compliance were unsatisfactory.<br>
