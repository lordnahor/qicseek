		<description><![CDATA[Dear Ramesh, 

This idea of building a large-scale ontology is fascinating.
A paper from A.Hauptmann at CIVR 2004 was talking about this idea for broadcast videos: &quot;Towards a Large Scale Concept Ontology for Broadcast Video&quot;. I know that some important work currently done at IBM  goes in the same direction as well. 
Do you know how far are these people from getting this large-scale ontology ?

There are several issues:
Building the ontology (i.e. getting the ontological commitment from people) itself is tough.
Getting the associated concept detectors working properly is even more difficult.
Another issue is to share the whole thing. Ontologies are designed to be shared aren&#039;t they?
If shared, should everybody be able to improve the detectors? 
If it is the case, incremental machine learning techniques should be very useful. 

If you have a look at my web-page (www.nicolas-maillot.net), you will understand that I have a particular interest in the notion of visual concept.
I am very interested in having your definition of a visual concept and of a visual object.
With my colleagues, we have defined visual concepts as independant from any domain kowledge.
They are used to describe the visual appearance (i.e. texture, color, shape, spatial relations) of high-level concepts (e.g. car, building)
From a computer vision point of view, visual concepts link high-level knowledge and image processing. They contribute to reduce the semantic gap.

regards, 

Nicolas]]></description>
