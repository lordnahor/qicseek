We here at CTNNCA want to extend a sincere "welcome".  Located in the west
wing of CTNN Medical Center is the CTNNCA.  CTNNCA is a business association
dedicated to the overall health and well-being of the tribal members and
anyone that seeks our services.  The Association was founded in July 1997 by
Dr. Earlroy Pride M.F.C.C., and Dr. Miguel Hernandez M.F.C.C. to provide
assistance and professional services to the Net Native community.
As licensed professional counselors they saw a need to help their tribal
members deal with life's stresses. Some life stresses include death, divorce,
low or poor self esteem, family or relationship difficulties, anger, and
depression.  While only physicians can prescribe medication, counselors often
work with pediatricians and psychiatrists when medication is needed.
