Three neat Web finds:

<li><A HREF="http://www.thomas.com/prod/geofind.html">Geofinder</a> Check 
out the images!  I thought that these were pretty cool myself.  
<li>Okay, if you are looking for a blast with the current President and 
his family, whether you love him or <B>don't like him</B> too much, check 
out the<A HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">Whitehouse 
Home Page</a> and get some interesting sounds, including Bill talking, 
and talking, and talking!
 <li>And Old School Trekkers just can not miss this display of classic 
stuff on the <A

be legal for anyone on a computer to have this much fun!

<LI><A NAME="QQ1"><H2>How can the Internet help me plan my winter 
vacation?</H2></A>
 Where would I really like to go on a winter vacation?  Perhaps I would 
be sick of the sun and I really want to go someplace where it is cold 
and you have to dig your car out of the snow every morning.  I'm 
browsing around the Internet and I find <A 
HREF="http://wings.buffalo.edu/world/">The Virtual Tourist World 
Map</A>.  I can narrow it down to the U.S. because of cost, and I look 
back on the east coast just because everyone knows that it is frigid 
there in the winter.  I think that I will look at Vermont, but only 
because not many people talk about Vermont, and it can't be that bad.  
I can find a place in the CyberMont directory about Vermont from the 
<A HREF="http://www.cybermalls.com/cymont/vermont/index.html">Departmemt 
of Travel and Tourism.</A> 
<p><IMG SRC="http://www.cybermalls.com/cymont/vermont/4skr001a.gif"> Now, 
I think that this looks like a pretty neat scene.  The travel bureau did 
a good job with this one.  Plus there are many more images and 
descriptions that can help with the decision on the vacation.  Coming 
soon to the page are different listings on vacation packages and other 
vital information when planning a trip.
<p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Let's return to the list of questions!</it></a> </p>
<LI><A NAME="QQ2"><H2>What can the Internet do for a 
heavy metal band?</H2>
<IMG SRC="http://bazaar.com/Megadeth/Gifs/caution.gif"> 
</A> This icon from the heavy metal group Megadeth is just part of that 
group's stab at a page on the WWW.  Their page(s) include all kinds of 
trivia, images, video, samples of their work in digital sound (of course), 
as well as the marketing of paraphanalia that some people might just 
buy.  the capabilities of such a system as a form of advertisement are 
only going to grow, and though possibly slightly twisted at times, 
Megadeth has overachieved in their attempt.  You can go to <A 
HREF=http://bazaar.com/Megadeth/megadeth.html>Megadeth Arizona</A> and 
see all of their techniques.  
<p> How can you go 
wrong with faces like <A HREF="http://bazaar.com/Megadeth/Gifs/group.jpg">
these? <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM 
SRC="http://bazaar.com/Megadeth/Gifs/group.gif"></A>  And you can even 
click on the picture to see their ugly faces a little bit larger!
<p> <A HREF="#Questions"><it>I 
want to return to the list of questions... now!</it></a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ3"><H2>What is the starting salary in investment 
banking for an analyst's position when one has a bachelors degree? 
(Economics)</H2>
</A> I start out looking on the EINet Galaxy search engine because I know 
there are many different subjects on that page.  My guess is that I will 
be heading for Business Administration studies in school, so I can follow 
that link.  And so I find the large heading <A 
HREF="http://galaxy.einet.net/galaxy/Business-and-Commerce/
Business-Administration/Financial-Aspects.html">Financial Aspects</A> and 
I decide that the financial aspects of my degree are what I am worrying 
about.  If it is one thing that I've learned, it's that looking around 
thoroughly on each separate page is very beneficial, so I look around and 
find the title <A 
HREF="http://www.cob.ohio-state.edu/dept/fin/osujobs.htm">Jobs in 
Finance</a> and I can look at something like <A 
HREF="http://www.cob.ohio-state.edu/dept/fin/ib.htm">Investment 
Banking</A> if I want, and I do.  When looking under the salaries link I 
find, <B>WOW</B>, that with only a bachelors degree the starting salaries 
range from $40,000 to $80,000 after bonus.  And I learn that the numbers 
just keep growing with each new degree and position.
 <p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Hey, 
let's go back to the list of questions.</it></a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ4"><H2>What is Australia's rank as a gold producer in 
the world? (Economics)</H2>
<IMG SRC="http://www.csu.edu.au/links/australia.gif">
</A> If I am interested in going where the surf is good, the beaches are 
nice and the gold is plentiful, where would I look?  Well, I've heard 
that the surf and the beaches in <B>Australia</B> are the ideal, but what 
about the gold situation?  As usual, there are many ways to get 
information, but I figured that an Australian University page, found at 
random, might 
be able to help.  It took a couple of tries to find one that might be 
suitable, but I finally found Charles Sturt University, though I figure 
that the same thing can be found on many other servers.  There is a link 
there for <A HREF="http://www.csu.edu.au/education/australia.html">Guide 
to Australia</A> where lots of information can be found, one of them 
being information on <A 
HREF="http://www.csu.edu.au/australia/defat/mining.html">mining</A>.  
There I find that Australia is the third largest gold producer after 
South Africa and the United States.  Thrilling, eh?
<p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to the list of questions, please.</it></a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ5"><H2>Since I live by the ocean now, I want to get 
a sailboat.  What is some information on Snark Boats, the company
that I have heard so much about?</H2>
</A> I found this server called CyberWharf, closely related to the 
Cybermall, which has a large listing of companies and much more 
information.  What I really want to see of all of this information is 
the <A HREF="http://www.cybermalls.com/cywharf/sailfl1.htm"> Sailboat 
Builders and Sailmakers</A>.  Of course, they have much information on 
the Company by the name of Snark that I want to find out about.  
<p><img border=1 hspace=5 vspace=5 align=left 
src="http://www.cybermalls.com/cywharf/snark/snrk001b.gif"><br>
Now these look like some pretty nice boats to me!  But that is not all 
that I can go by.  I think that I want to look at <A 
HREF="http://www.cybermalls.com/cywharf/snark/snarkdat.htm#Sunflower"> 
The Sunflower 3.3</A> in more detail.  Once I do all of this, I can make 
up my mind as to the right size boat. In this case, the boat is 11 feet 
long, can seat up to 2 people, and has a Sail Area of 55 sq. ft.  
This comes complete with sail, daggerboard, rudder, riggings and 
fitting.  Mast, spar and boom are aluminum and the wooden parts are 
marine varnished.  The wooden sail seat is optional.  I guess that I will 
have to go to a local dealer to get a quote on prices.<p><A
