<LI><A NAME="QQ1"><B>What is a protocol?</B></A><br>
<P>Well, when you're referring to computers (i.e., <A HREF=
"http://hyperg.tu-graz.ac.at:80/AD096B8F/T0x811be681_0x00005f5d">hacker 
jargon</A>) protocol refers to any set of rules that allow 
different machines or pieces of software to coordinate with each other 
without ambiguity.  But if you want to know the definition you would find in 
the <A HREF="http://c.gp.cs.cmu.edu:5103/prog/webster?protocol">Webster 
Dictionary</A>, then the answer is an original draft, minute, or record 
of  a document or transaction.  A transaction, hmm...that sounds kind of 
like what the jargon definition is referring to--exchanging data via an 
agreement <p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ2"><B>How do you pick a lock?</B></A><br>
Ah, you coniving little bugger.  I should have figured you'd ask something 
like that.  Well as a matter of fact there is a rather extensible document 
called the <A 
HREF="http://www.lysator.liu.se:7500/mit-guide/mit-guide.html">Guide to 
Lockpicking</A> that is accessible on the Web.  Naturally there is an 
accompanying document discussing the <A 
HREF="http://www.lysator.liu.se:7500/mit-guide/appendixB.html">legalities</A> 
involved in lock-picking.  I won't try to describe how to pick a lock 
in my own words because I'm sure I wouldn't do it justice, and the pictures 
included in the document are far more descriptive than I would be.

<LI><A NAME="QQ3"><B>How do I improve the security of my Web site?</B></A><br>
According to the <A HREF="http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~werdna/agtc.html">
Admin-Guide-to-Cracking-101</A> if you want to beat a <A 
HREF="http://hyperg.tu-graz.ac.at:80/940AD82F/T0x811be681_0x00005d82">hacker</A> 
you must first learn the ways of a hacker.  This document puts you 
through a typical scenario in which a person tries to gain illegal access to a 
system.  Then it tells you methods of defeating such attempts.  It is 
an extremely interesting document, as it actually takes you through the 
steps of how someone would hack into an account.

<LI><A NAME="QQ4"><B>What is fuzzy logic?</B></A><br>
<A HREF="http://www.quadralay.com/www/Fuzzy/FAQ/FAQ02.html">Fuzzy 
logic</A> is a method within Boolean logic whose purpose is to deal with 
the values that lie "between" completely true and completely false.  Let 
me explain.  In Boolean algebra, via a set of defined operators, a 
statement obtains a value of true or false.  Depending on the values used 
for the variables in the statement a statement may be true all of the 
time, some of the time, or never.  Fuzzy logic deals with the cases in 
which it is true some of the time.

<LI><A NAME="QQ5"><B>How do I write an HTML document?</B></A><br>
The letters HTML stand for HyperText Markup Language, so it makes sense 
that you create an <A 
HREF="http://www.pcweek.ziff.com/~eamonn/crash_course.html">HTML</A>  
document via markups, which are statements 
enclosed in &LT and &GT (less than and greater than brackets).  <A 
HREF="http://www.pcweek.ziff.com/~eamonn/crash_course.html">The purpose of 
HTML</A> is to specify the structure of the document, not the 
appearance.  <A 
HREF="http://www.pcweek.ziff.com/~eamonn/crash_course.html">Writing an 
HTML document</A> is similar to programming in that you use words and 
symbols with predefined meanings to stand for something else.
