My son-in-law forwarded me your e-mail with regard to the above David Langsam.
The only information I have about that name is the following:
My husband's father had a brother by the name of Mendel Benjamin Brashem who 
was married to Sarah Rosumny.  They had three daughters, the eldest Ruth 
married a Dave Langsam in 1939.  They had one son Martin born in 1945.  Ruth 
was blind and the family did not feel that she could take care of Martin and 
he was adopted by another sister by the name of Myrtle who was married to 
Lester Kirklin and they raised him.  I do not know if this is any relation to 
your David Langsam.

The information I sent you is all I have.  I did contact another relative and 
she stated the same information.  When he was adopted he no longer had any 
contact with the family and they have not heard from him since that time.  
Sorry I cannot give you any more information.
