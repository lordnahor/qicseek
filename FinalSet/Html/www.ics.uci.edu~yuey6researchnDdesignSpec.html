<h2> Draft Specification for <co>design</co> Variable in <co>networkDynamic</co> Objects </h2>
<p>Yue Yu</p>
<h5> Descriptions</h5>
<p>In order to have a consistent indication of how the missingness is introduced by different design of the survey, we plan to add a new variable <co> design </co> to the <co>networkDynamic</co> object. 
</p><p>
<br>
<co>design</co> can be treated as a parameter of the entire network - if the data is collected under the same survey design; or an attribute for each ego (should this be one for each ego, or one for each vertex in the network?), if the design of the survey changes over egos.
</p>
<p> Please see: <a href = "missingnessWriteUp.html">a write-up about how missingness is introduces by different designs</a> for more details.

<h5> Data Structure </h5>
<p>
<i> This is a tentative data structure. See "Question" section for other potential implementations</i>
<p> <u> If design varies over the survey</u>: the <co>design</co> is a list of length E, where E is the number of egos. Each element in <co> design</co>, <co>design[[i]]</co> for <co> i = 1, 2, ..., E</co> is a <co> designs</co> object. <co>designs</co> object is a list of the <co>design.specifications</co>.
</p>
<p> <u> If the design stays unchanged</u>: then <co> design</co> is a list of <co>design.parameters</co>. (same as <co>designs</co>)</p>
<p class = "verbatim">

<h5> design.specifications </h5>
<p> 
<table class = "parameters">
<tr>
<td> type </td>
<td> string variable that specifies the design type. The options are <co>"lastK", "intervalN", "snapshot"</co>  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> parameters</td>
<td> parameters for a specific design are store in the <co> parameter</co> variable. To make it clear, we list these specification under 3 categories: <co>lastK.parameters, intervalN.parameters, snapshot.parameters</co>. However, the category of the parameters does not need to be specified, as long as the parameter names are provided.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> lastK.parameters</td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>K </td>
<td>The number of most recent ties recorded. </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> end.point</td>
<td>This is a string variable that takes value <co>"onset"</co> or <co> "termini"</co>. </a>)  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> measurement.time</td>
<td> records the time the survey was taken</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> is.ID</td>
<td> indicate if the egos and alters are ID'ed. (NEEDTO: confirm with Carter.)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> SemultaneousEndpoint</td>
<td> (or <co>SemultaneousEndpointResolution</co>) if the Kth and (K+1)th egos happen to have the same endpoint, how do we choose from the two? This variable takes one of the two strings "pickAtRandom", "includeEveryThing". </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> intervalN.parameters</td>
<td> </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> N</td>
<td> the interval specified. If N is a scaler, then it is assumed to be N time unit before the survey time. If N is a vector of length 2, then N[1] is the start time and N[2] is the end time of the interval.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> censorship</td>
<td> a boolean scaler or vector indicates if the data is censored. If it is a boolean vector of length 2 then <co>censorship[1]</co> is the indication for left censorship and <co>censorship[2]</co> is for right censorship.  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>measurement.time</td>
<td> this is the same as the <co>measurement.time</co> in <co>"lastK"</co> design.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> </td>

<h5> Questions</h5>
<p><b>1. How to represent the design when it varies over the survey?</b>
<br> Assume : The number of egos is E, the number of all subjects(egos+alters) is V.

<br>(a)<br> <co>design</co> is a list of length E, or, 
<br> <co>design</co> is a list of length V
</p>
<p class ="ind">
The difference between these two is essentially, if it is possible/do we allow the survey type varies over a single ego's alters. My thoughts are, there might be conflicts when we allow the type to vary. 
</p><p class ="ind">
First question is that is this setting necessary? In what situation, and how often would this happen?
</p><p class ="ind">
Second question is, are there an easy way to incorporate this into the missingness model. Eg. Assume an ego has alters A and B, A is collected under the <co>lastK</co> assumption and B under the <co>intervalN</co> assumption. If A's tie does not over lap with the <co> intervalN</co>' interval, then this could introduce complexity in the missingness analysis.  
</p>
<p> 
<br> (b)<br> <co>design</co> is a list of <co>designs</co> objects corresponding to each ego/alter, each <co>designs</co> is a list of design specifications. Or,
<br> <co>design</co> is an integer vector stores the indices of the <co>designs</co> that are employed, and <co>design.collection</co> is a list of <co> designs</co> objects that are used in the dataset. 
</p><p class ="ind">
The latter implementation stores the designs in a "dictionary" and performs "look up"to retrieve information. In general it will reduce the amount of data we store in an network object. However it will introduce look up time and some storage overhead. If the dataset is small, or the type of survey varies a lot over the subject, it might not be wise to use the latter implementation. 
</p>

<p>(c)<br> Make <co> design</co> varies for each subject, or<br>
make <co>parameters</co> in <co>design</co> varies?</p>
<p class = "ind"> Instead of making <co>design</co> a list of length V, we can make <co> parameters</co> in <co> design</co> either a value, if the design is the same in this aspect or a vector of length V, if the design varies. 
<p>  
<p class = "ind"> The latter implementation saves us some storage space: when only a few parameters varies under <co> design</co>, we can store most parameters as scaler and a few as vectors. However, if almost all parameters are different for each subject, it would be wise to just assign different <co> design</co> object to each subject.
