Three neat Web finds:
<ol>
<li>It is very interesting seeing chinese words displayed in the World 
Wide Web.  The Web is capable of presenting chinese characters 
as inline <a 
href="http://galaxy.einet.net/galaxy/Engineering-and-Technology/Computer-Technology/Computer-Graphics-and-Art.html">graphics</a>, 
thereby making them presentable on 
any browser capable of displaying such graphics.<li>It is amazing how 
clicking on a word can provide links to so many other <a 
href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/www_faq.html">web</a> 
documents.  The capacity of exchanging information throughout the world is really 
powerful. <li>It is nice how extensively graphics are figuring in to web 
page design, especially in the entertainment sites.  I like the <a 
href="http://galaxy.einet.net/galaxy/Arts-and-Humanities/Visual-Arts.html">art</a> 
gallery home page in the web, it features a limited selection of works 
along with commentary and the inevitable links to other art sites on the 
web. </ol>

<LI><A NAME="QQ1"><B>What is the function of Add-ons and is it a client
or a server?</B></A><br>
In the design of web clients, they're usually designed to display HTML 
pages, and they display text files.  Some clients are capable of 
displaying more files than other, but for the most party they can 
handle an extremely limited variety.  To display other kinds of 
formatted files, or video, sound, and graphic files, you need a variety 
of external programs.  Typically these are called viewers, although 
players, tools, and add-ons are other names for them.  Essentially, the 
add-ons compensate for the <a 
href="http://www.prosci.uci.edu/ProSciDocs/WebBrowsers.html">browser's</a> 
limitations, offering users a 
means of fully accessing every link they find on the web.  Add-ons is a 
general term encompassing viewers, players, and other <a 
href="http://www.univ.trieste.it/mmwwwpc/mmwwwpc.html">multimedia</a> 
additions to web clients.<p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of

<LI><A NAME="QQ2"><B>What is HTML and how does this relate to the World Wide Web?</B></A><br>
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/sample.html">HTML</a> is a simplified 
derivation of SGML, or Standard Generalized 
Markup Language, which is a code used to make documents readable across a 
variety of platforms and software.  HTML operates through a series of 
codes placed within a text document and these codes are translated by a 
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/www.cacm.html">World Wide Web</a> client 
into specific kinds of formats to be displayed on 
the screen.  These items include links, lists, headings, titles, images, 
forms and maps.  The documents on the World Wide Web browsers are usually 
HTML documents.  HTML carefully defines the structure of a document so 
that any browser can read it and display it in a way that is best for 
that browser. <p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of

<LI><A NAME="QQ3"><B>Who is Adam Smith and what kind of theory did he propose about the study of economics?</B></A><br>
Adam Smith is known to be the father of economics.  He believes the 
"invisible hand" of self-interest leads individuals to promote the 
interests of others.  The theorem of the Invisible Hand states that given 
a number of ideal conditions, optimizing behavior on the part of 
individuals and firms under pure competition leads to an efficient 
outcome.  The art of <a 
href="http://www.socsci.uci.edu/econ/econ.html">economics</a> 
consisits in looking not merely at 
the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; making <a 
href="http://akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo/Economy/Markets_and_Investments/">
investment</a> 
consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely
 for one group but 
for all groups.<p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of

<LI><A NAME="QQ4"><B>What is microeconomic and macroeconomics?</B></A><br>
Microeconomic is the branch of <a 
href="http://c.gp.cs.cmu.edu:5103/prog/webster?economics">economics</a>
 that studies the 
decisions of individual households and firms.
  Microeconomics also studies the way in 
which individual markets work and the detailed way in which regulation 
and taxes affect the allocation of labor and of goods and services.  
Macroeconomics is the branch of economics that studies the economy as a 
whole.  It seeks to understand the big picture rather than the detailed 
individual choices.  In particular, it studies the determination of the 
overall level of economic activity -- of unemployment, aggregate income, 
average prices, and <a 
href="http://c.gp.cs.cmu.edu:5103/prog/webster?inflation">inflation.</a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ5"><B>Government try to raise wages through Minimum Wage Law, is this a good idea for the economy?</B></A><br>
<a href="http://wuecon.wustl.edu/other_www/EconFAQ/EconFAQ.html">Economist</a> agree that 
minimum wages hit the hardest on the 
unskilled.  The labor saving technology is constantly being invented, and as a result, 
the demand skilled types is decreasing.  The amount of hours of labor 
available at minimum wage exceed the labor demanded, which leads to 
unemployment.  Since there is a preponderance of unskilled workers among 
the young because they have less opportunity to obtain work experience 
and acquire skills; therefore, the minimum wage still cause more 
<a 
href="http://galaxy.einet.net/galaxy/Community/The-Workplace.html">umemployment</a> 
among young workers than older workers.  The 
law forces the payment of higher wage to the industry; however, that industry can then 
charge higher prices for its product, so that the burden of paying the 
higher wage is shifted to consumers. <p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to
