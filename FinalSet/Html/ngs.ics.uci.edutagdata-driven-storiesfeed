				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Given the status of technology today, it is very easy to capture experiential data, such as photos, for events and even organize them.  That means that one can now easily store experiential data and use it to tell stories.  This means that now that the stories can have more real data associated with them.  In this respect the art of storytelling is getting closer to reporting.  It may appear that we may lose some important features of stories in this process.  Stories based on captured experiences will definitely be different from those that were based on recreating experiences using only text.  For one thing, stories are becoming more data driven.  Just see popular websites like Facebook â€“ where many stories are being told by posting photos and Albums.  Or look at Pinterest where stories are being told by collecting appropriate pictures from different sources.  For small or micr stories, people are commonly using sites like FourSquare and Path where stories are being told by collecting different data â€“ photos, location, text, and audio &#8211;  about an event.  This shows that people realize that it is more important to describe (and share) more details of the event than just a textual description.  In place of saying that I am on gate 13 at Orange County airport, I can share the map based location, the name of the place (gate 13), and picture of the place  at that moment with almost the same effort (but of course with significantly more bits) as in only text.  And that is the difference that technology is making â€“ particularly smart phones have made.</p>
<p>This is OK to share micro stories.  But what will happen when you want to tell â€˜realâ€™ stories that unfold over time.  Say you want to share the experience about what happened in 2011, or how your relationship unfolded with Tom, or how dis you build the team and made your dreams real?</p>
<p>Well stories are made of micro stories.  There is â€˜glueâ€™ needed to put them together, but there are always â€˜momentsâ€™ that are pulled and then glued to make the complete story.  It is quite possible that you may be living those moments and not capture them using your phone, but ultimately all these stories really represent selecting those moments, making them concrete by using appropriate experiential data, and then providing all necessary glue.  Remember a beautiful building is made of raw material that is piled at some stage.  By selecting appropriate components from different piles and putting it together, an architect and a builder convert it to a beautiful and useful place.  A storyteller must select experiential data of all available moments and put it together to tell a story.  Just a collection of data for moments is only as much a story as putting together all photos from the year in random order are story of the year.  Even a simple organization, like putting them in time order, starts becoming more interesting â€“ then putting them on a timeline makes them more interesting.  If we start putting some meta data about each picture, we start providing more components of the story.</p>
<p>Effectively, technology has given us tools that allow us to collect all this data effortlessly.  We also have tools to store and organize this data so we can easily pull out what we need.  But the problem of selecting appropriate data from relevant moments is a difficult one.  And then rendering it in a compelling order is the art that storytelling is.  Current technology is changing the nature of stories â€“ by making them more data driven â€“ but it is not going to make everybody a Mark Twain or a Steven Spielberg â€“ it is only helping by reducing efforts in collecting experiences that were either not possible to collect or were very difficult and this in turn will result in making stories closer to facts than fiction.  The fiction component will be the â€˜glueâ€™ to make stories more interesting and compelling.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One form of story telling that is evolving rapidly due to the popularity of micro-blogs are micro-stories.  First came micro-blogs that made sharing your experience or opinion or activities almost spontaneous using short &#8216;blogs&#8217;.  These were still dominated by &#8216;text&#8217;.  The primary form of these stories was still text.  Since technology was evolving very rapidly, mobile phones started becoming a popular client on the internet.  And on mobile phones, some sensors became very common.  And these sensors started changing the nature of the story telling.</p>
<p>First sensor to revolutionize sharing of experiences in the form of micro-story telling was the camera.  SUddently visual stories started becoming popular.  Photo sharing became a major craze.  One can see rise in number of photos being uploaded to share events.  Rise of Instagram, Path, Tiny Review, erly, and numerous others &#8212; too many to mention &#8212; demonstrated that people like to share visual moments.  Video is not that popular &#8211; but is likely to become more popular as storage and bandwidth become further inexpensive.</p>
<p>The second sensor to bring a new dimension to story telling is GPS.  Many small companies have started and some major companies tried their hands in micro-story telling using GPS based location of a user.  FourSquare will let you capture your location and share it with your experiences as well as recommendations.  Despite expressed privacy and security concerns, the use of location-based check-in as well as services keeps increasing.</p>
<p>Here I will not discuss any other sensors &#8212; like the healthcare related one &#8212; but just point out an intriguing trend.  The first stage was micr-blogs, then came in photos, and then was the turn of location.  Experience sharing in these three steps has gone through a remarkable change.  In the first stage, we needed to deliberately type (or should we say tap) about 100 times on the mobile phone screen.  WHen cameras became a mechanism, much information was captured by the camera and only a few &#8212; say 10 &#8212; taps were required to share a story.  With location based stories, one went further because one can include photos also and still needs just a few taps &#8212; say 10 &#8212; to share the story.  So, now we can tell richer stories using an order of magnitude fewer taps.  This is what I call data revolution.  Data revolution results in capturing experiential data using sensors making shared experiences richer while effort involved to share these experiences significantly lesser.  And this trend is an interesting one.</p>
