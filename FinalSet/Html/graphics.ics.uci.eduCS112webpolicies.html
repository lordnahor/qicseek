    This page describes what will be expected of each student in this class, and how grades
    will be computed.  If any of these policies are unclear, or if you believe them
    to be unfair in any way, please contact the instructor,
    and include &quot;CS112&quot; somewhere in the subject line.
    Any changes in policy will be announced in class, and recorded on this page.

    <b>Attendance:</b> 
        Students are strongly encouraged to attend every lecture.  Although much
        of what is discussed in class will also be covered by supporting
        materials distributed in class and avaiable on the <a href="downloads.html">downloads</a> page,
        there will be important information that you will miss if you are
        not in class.  If you must miss a class for any reason, you are encouraged
        to obtain notes from a fellow student who attended the lecture.
        If that is impossible, please contact the TA or the instructor.
        You will be responsible for all the material covered in class, and it is <i>your</i> job
        to stay informed if you miss a class.

    <p>
    <img src="icons/greenball1.gif">
    <b>Homework and exams:</b>
        There will be approximately five homework assignments, a midterm exam, and a final exam.
        You will have between one and two weeks to complete each homework assignment,
        and each assignment will carry equal weight.
        Your work will be judged on correctness, completeness, and clarity.  Clarity includes,
        but is not limited to, easy-to-follow logical structure and documentation (commenting!) of programs,
        as well as legibility and adequacy of explanations that accompany proofs and other written portions.
        Even brilliant ideas have little value if they are not communicated clearly.
        Consequently, work that is hastily conceived and/or scribbled on ripped-out notebook pages will
        be unlikely to receive a high score.

    <p>
    <img src="icons/greenball1.gif">
    <b>Grades:</b>
        Grades will be based on the homeworks (65%), the midterm (15%) and the final exam (20%).
        Exceptions may be made in the
        case of students who perform exceptionally well on the homework or an exam.
        In this case, the instructor reserves the right to adjust the final
        score upward.  Other factors, such as attendance, participation in class, and extra credit work
        (see <i>bonus problems</i> below) may also favorably influence your grade.
        Final letter grades will be assigned using a &quot;curve&quot;; that is, the grade cutoffs will
        be based in part on the performance of the class as a whole.  Typically, passing grades begin at about
        60%, with the A-range beginning in the mid to high 80s.  However, these ranges vary from class to class.
        If you have concerns about how you are doing in the class, please contact the instructor.

    <p>
    <img src="icons/greenball1.gif">
    <b>Bonus problems:</b>
        On some assignments you will be given the opportunity to submit solutions to one or more
        <i>bonus problems</i>, which go beyond the required homework.  If you choose not to do the bonus problems, it
        will not affect your grade.  To ensure fairness, bonus work will be handled in the following manner:
        All credit that is earned through bonus problems will be tallied separately, and will not be
        taken into consideration until <i>all final grades have been tentatively assigned</i>.  As a final step
        in the grading process, those students who have earned a significant number of bonus points may
        have their grades adjusted upward by as much as a full letter grade (although &quot;half&quot; a grade
        is more typical).  Those students whose grades are on the borderline between two grades are most
        likely to benefit from having accumulated bonus points.

    <p>
    <img src="icons/greenball1.gif">
    <b>Submitting your homework:</b>
        Written homework should normally be submitted at the beginning of class on the day that it is due.
        If you submit late homework, you may drop it off at the TA's office.
    
        Programmming assignments should be submitted electronically using EEE, uploading them
        to the appropriate drop box.  When uploading electronic submissions, please submit only ONE file;
        a zipped folder containing all the files you wish to submit, which will typically include one or
        more source files, images, sample output, etc.  Please do NOT submit binary files, such as executables
        and project files unless explicitly requested to do so in the assignment.

    <b>Picking up your homework:</b>
        <!-- <img src="icons/updated.gif">&nbsp; -->
        Graded homeworks may be picked up from the TA's office.
        We recommend that you first check <a href="https://eee.uci.edu">EEE</a>; once the grade is posted, the homework should be
        available for pick-up.
<!---
        Graded homework may be picked up from the <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/distribution/">ICS distribution center</a>.
        This applies to homework that has been submitted electronically as well as homework submitted on paper.
        Your homework grades will also be available to
        you via <a href="https://eee.uci.edu">EEE</a>.
        We recommend that you first check <a href="https://eee.uci.edu">EEE</a>; once the grade is posted, the homework should be
        available at the distribution center for pick-up by the following business day.

    <b>Extensions and late homework:</b>
        Each student will automatically be granted an additional 48 hours on any
        graded item upon <i>written</i> request via email to a TA (<i>not the instructor!</i>), made <i>on or before</i>
        the due date, which is to
        include a one or two sentence
        explanation of the circumstances.  In particular, please state whether your request is a
        result of difficulties you are having with the material, or due to other
        circumstances (which you need not go into detail about).
        Note that the extension will <i>always</i> be granted, regardless of the reason, but only
        one such extension will be granted per homework.
        We ask that you supply a brief expalantion so that we might be alerted to
        problems that may warrant some corrective action on behalf of the entire class (e.g. a homework
        problem that should be explained more fully or worded differently).<br>
        <p>
        The automatic extension policy does <i>not</i> apply to exams.
        Medical exceptions are always honored, however.  Other exceptions
        may be made due to special circumstances upon request from the instructor.
        <p>
        Homeworks that are submitted late (which means after the extended date if an extension was requested)
        will be penalized at a rate of up to 10% per day late.  Please see the instructor if you are
        significantly behind, or have homework that is more than a week late.
        It is <i>always</i> advisable to submit homework, however, even if it
        is incomplete and/or very late.
        
    <p>
    <img src="icons/greenball1.gif">
    <b>Questions about grades:</b>
        If you have questions about the way your homework was graded, or feel that you deserve a
        higher score, <i>first</i> discuss the matter with the grader or the TA.  If you are unable
        to resolve the issue satisfactorily with the grader or the TA, <i>then</i> bring it to the
        attention of the instructor.
        <u>In all email correspondence with the instructor, TA, or grader, please be sure to include
        &quot;CS112&quot; somewhere in the subject line.</u>  Your email may be overlooked if you forget to do this.

   <p>
    <img src="icons/greenball1.gif">
    <b>Class participation:</b>
        Questions and comments during class are always welcomed.  If you are
        having difficulty following a discussion, you are likely not alone.
        Please ask for clarification or elaboration when necessary,
        or inject relevant comments and observations.
        While class participation is not explicity
        part of the grading for this class, the instructor reserves the
        right to reward students who regularly participate in class
        and thereby enrich the learning experience of others.
 
    <p>
    <img src="icons/greenball1.gif">
    <b>Collaboration:</b>
        You are strongly encouraged to collaborate with your peers on homeworks,
        as such communication is one of the most valuable opportunities
        for learning.  However, collaboration, as it is to be understood in this
        class, does <i>not</i> include copying the work of another, nor exchanging
        complete solutions verbally, in writing, or in any other form
        with another student in the class.
        (Please see the page on <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~arvo/honesty.html"><i>intellectual honesty</i></a>.)
        Collaboration implies exploring ideas together, not transfering completed
        work, or any portion thereof.
        The latter constitutes <i><b>plagiarism</b></i>, and will be dealt with harshly
        if it is discovered.  <u>Each act of plagiarism will be documented and reported to the dean,
        and will be sufficient grounds for failing every student involved, including
        those who knowingly <i>provided</i> the plagiarized material.</u>
        <p>
        In general, each student must write 
        homework solutions and programs entirely on their own, although the ideas leading up
        to those solutions and programs may have been developed or discovered in consultation
        with one or more class members.   Any exceptions will be noted in class and explained
        on the announcements portion of the
        <a href="https://eee.uci.edu/toolbox/noteboard/index.php?board=7520">discussion board</a>
        and/or in the homework itself.
        If you are unsure whether some activity falls within the boundaries
        of legitimate collaboration, please ask the instructor or the TA.

    <p>
    <img src="icons/greenball1.gif">
    <b>Courtesy toward others:</b>
        Beyond the narrow technical requirements of this class, each student will
        be expected to represent his/her work honestly, and to be fair and respectful
        toward others in the class.  As one minor example, please refrain from
        carrying on conversations with your neighbor in class once the class has begun,
        as even hushed voices can be heard throughout a classroom and can be a significant
        distraction.  Also, please try to arrive on time, as students who enter
        late tend to disrupt the class and are apt to miss announcements.

    <p>
    <img src="icons/greenball1.gif">
    <b>Feedback:</b>
        If you wish to receive feedback from us concerning your performance
        in the class, please make an appointment to speak with the TA or the instructor. 
        In addition, feedback <i>from you</i> is essential in keeping the level
        of the lectures and homework assignments tuned to the class.
        Please let us know in class, during office hours, via email
        to the instructor, or even via the discussion board
        if you are having unexpected difficulties in the class, or wish to share comments of any
        other nature.
        Above all, if you are falling behind, it is much easier to
        take corrective action if this is made known early on, rather than waiting
        until the end of the quarter.
