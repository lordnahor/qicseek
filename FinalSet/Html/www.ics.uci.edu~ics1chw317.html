Three neat Web finds:
<ol>
<li><A HREF="http://www.scubed.com:8001/caltrans/oc/oc_big_map.shtml">Caltrans Freeway Conditions</A> is great for
commuters who need to know the freeway conditions.
<li><A HREF="http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/duff/index.html">Fantasy Role-Playing Games</A>  contains information about
popular Fantasy Role-Playing Games.
<li><A HREF="http://gnn.com/cgi-bin/imagemap/HOME?330,346">GNN Sports Center</A> is great for the sports fan.  It
contains information on popular sporting events.

<LI><A NAME="QQ1"><H2>What is the World Wide Web?</H2></A>
My answer is... <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">The World Wide Web</A> is a matrix of
computer systems from around the world linked together to provide a wide variety of information.  One distinguishing
feature about the Web is that it uses the <A HREF="http://nearnet.gnn.com/gnn/wic/html.03.html">HTML</A> markup
language.  This allows information from a variety of documents to be linked together in a continuous format. This ease
of use is what makes the Web so popular, and the amount of information it is able to provide is growing at an
astonishing rate everyday. Despite the vast amount of computer systems,
<A HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Addressing/Addressing.html">Universal Resource Identifiers</A>, or URLs, 
allow users to link up to the various servers.  URIs are addresses of servers that provide specific information.  
<p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ2"><H2>With the vast amount of information available on the Web, how does one find a desired piece of
document?</H2></A>
My answer is... Like a library catalog, one can use different techniques to search for a piece of information.  The
first way is to search for a particular subject.  A comprehensive center is the
<A HREF="http.info.cern.ch/hypertext/DataSources/bySubject/Overview.html">CERN Virtual Library</A>.  Here one can
begin to search for subject-oriented information.  Another great center for subject-oriented search is the
<A HREF="http://www.einet.net/galaxy.html">Galaxy</A> developed by EINet.  As with any searches, having more resources
increases the chances of a successful find.  Another way to search for information on the Web is by using keywords.
To use this in the Web, one can access the
<A HREF="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/home/mcbryan/WWWW.html">World Wide Web Worm</A>.  To use the Worm, one has to type
an exact keyword pattern; the pattern, however, is case insensitive.  These two types of searches should allow the
user to find the desired piece of document.
<p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ3"><H2>What is QQ3?</H2></A>
My answer is... Tobacco smoke induces changes in the respiratory cell layers.  It has been found that tobacco smoke
contains a variety of tumorigenic agents, including several that can act as complete carcinogens by themselves.  In
addition, tumor initiators, promoters, and cocarcinogens have also been identified in smoke.  This leads to a broad
disease subject called <A HREF="http://cancer.med.upenn.edu/0/topics/smoking_1">Lung Cancer</A>.  One of the more
recent topics that have been identified with smoking in addition to promoting cancer is the topic of risks in
<A HREF="http://cancer.med.upenn.edu/0h/buhle/cancer_news/smoke_child.html">pregnant mothers smoking</A>.  Infants of
smoking mothers are small for their gestational age in weight, length, and head circumference, and they experience a
higher perinatal mortality.
<p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ4"><H2>What is Gopher and how does it differ from the Web and FTP?</H2></A>
My answer is... The Gopher system is like the
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">World Wide Web</A> in that it can access the same
information using various servers such as FTP, telnet, or WAIS.  However, the method of display in Gopher is very 
different from the World Wide Web.  Although the Gopher also uses
<A HREF="http://cuiwww.unige.ch/w3catalog/nsp.html">hyperlink</A> documents, it does not utilize the
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">hypertext</A> enviroment.  For example, if one connects 
to the <A HREF="http://nearnet.gnn.com/gnn/wic/netinfo.44.html">Gopher Jewels Server</A>, one would find a set of 
menus with links to other documents.  FTP, on the other hand, does not utilize any form of hyperlink technology.  
Rather, it is a protocol for directly transferring files.  A list of
<A HREF="http://nearnet.gnn.com/gnn/wic/netinfo.24.html">Anonymous FTP sites</A> contains sites for a broad range of
information.
<p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ5"><H2>How are pain and touch signals transmitted to the brain for processing?</H2></A>
My answer is... The most simple model of sensory information transmission can be found in the <A 
HREF="http://george.lbl.gov/ITG.hm.pg.docs/Whole.Frog/Whole.Frog.html">anatomy of a frog</A>.  The Free Nerve 
Endings and Meissner's Corpuscles detect pain, temperature, and light touch.  Each touch receptor is specialized 
for specific types of signals.  The touch receptors transform the signals into electrical neural signals which 
travel to special parts of the brain for processing.  This transformation of enviromental energy into electrical 
energy is called transduction, and this electrical energy travel through <A 
HREF="http://george.lbl.gov/ITG/Whole.Frog/frog/label4.jpg">cutnaeous nerves</A>, which line the deepest 
skin layers.  Thus, sensory information is transduced into electrical signals, which travel through nerves to the 
brain.
