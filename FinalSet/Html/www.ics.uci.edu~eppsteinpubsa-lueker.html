We define the min-min expectation selection problem (resp. max-min
expectation selection problem) to be that of selecting k out of n given
discrete probability distributions, to minimize (resp. maximize) the
expectation of the minimum value resulting when independent random
variables are drawn from the selected distributions. Such problems
can be viewed as a simple form of two-stage stochastic programming.
We show that if d,
the number of values in the support of the distributions, is a constant
greater than 2, the min-min expectation problem is NP-complete but
admits a fully polynomial time approximation scheme. For d an arbitrary
integer, it is NP-hard to approximate the min-min expectation problem
with any constant approximation factor. The max-min expectation problem
is polynomially solvable for constant d; we leave open its complexity
for variable d. We also show similar results for binary selection
problems in which we must choose one distribution from each of n pairs
of distributions.

We investigate several simplified models for k-anonymization in
databases, show them to be hard to solve exactly, and provide
approximation algorithms for them.
<p>
The min-max bin covering problem is
closely related to one of our models. An input to this problem consists
of a collection of items with sizes and a threshold size. The items must
be grouped into bins such that the total size within each bin is at
least the threshold, while keeping the maximum bin size as small as possible.
