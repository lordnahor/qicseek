Since orderings are properties of collections, it makes more sense to create them when the collection is created than incidentally when the first member is added or by PROPPATCH after creation of the collection.

Would an ordering still get created automatically if someone did PUT or ADDREF with Position on an unordered collection?
</UL><UL>
