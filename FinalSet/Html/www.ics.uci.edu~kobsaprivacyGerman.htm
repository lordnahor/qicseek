is not governed by Land legislation and in so far as they
<P>
a) execute federal law or

<P>
4. &quot;blocking&quot; means labelling stored personal data so
as to restrict their further processing or use,
<P>
5. &quot;erasure&quot; means the deletion of stored personal data.

<H3><A NAME="nr4">Section </A>4 Admissibility of data processing
and use</H3>

<P>
(1) The processing and use of personal data shall be admissible
only if this Act or any other legal provision permits or prescribes
them or if the data subject has consented.
<P>
<a name="sec4(2)"></a>
(2) When consent is obtained from the data subject, he shall be
informed of the purpose of storage and of any envisaged communication
of his data and, at his request, of the consequences of withholding

be deemed to exist where the defined purpose of research would
be impaired considerably if consent were obtained in writing.
In such case the information pursuant to the first sentence of
paragraph 2 above and the reasons from which considerable impairment
of the defined purpose of research would arise shall be recorded
in writing.
<H3><A NAME="nr5">Section </A>5 Confidentiality</H3>

<P>
Persons employed in data processing shall not process or use personal
data without authorization (confidentiality) . On taking up their
duties such persons, in so far as they work for private bodies,

which several bodies are entitled to store and if the data subject
is unable to ascertain the controller of the data file, he may
approach any of these bodies. Such body is obliged to forward
the request of the data subject to the controller of the data
file. The data subject shall be informed of the forwarding of
the request and of the controller of the data file. The bodies
listed in section 19 (3) of this Act, public prosecution and police
authorities as well as public finance authorities may, in so far
as they store personal data in performing their legal duties within
the area of application of the Fiscal Code for monitoring and
control purposes, inform the Federal Commissioner for Data Protection
instead of the data subject. In such case the further procedure
shall be as described in section 19 (6) of this Act.
<H3><A NAME="nr7">Section </A>7 Compensation by public bodies
</H3>

<P>
(1) Where a public body causes harm to the data subject through
automated processing of his personal data that is inadmissible
or incorrect under the provisions of this Act or other data protection
provisions, such body is obliged to compensate the data subject
for the harm thus caused, irrespective of any fault.
<P>
(2) In grave cases of violation of privacy, the data subject shall
receive adequate pecuniary compensation for the immaterial harm
caused.
<P>
(3) The claims under paragraphs 1 and 2 above shall be limited
to a total amount of DM 250,000. Where, due to the same occurrence,
compensation has to be paid to several persons and exceeds the
maximum amount of DM 250,000, the compensation paid to each of
them shall be reduced in proportion to the maximum amount.
<P>
(4) If, in the case of a data file, several bodies are entitled
to store the data and the injured person is unable to ascertain
the controller of the data file, each body shall be liable.
<P>
(5) Where several parties are responsible they shall be jointly
and severally liable.
<P>
(6) Sections 254 and 852 of the Civil Code shall apply mutatis
mutandis to contributory negligence on the part of the data subject
and to statutory limitation.
<P>
(7) Provisions according to which a party responsible is liable
to a greater extent than under this provision or according to
which another person is responsible for the harm shall remain
unaffected.
<P>
(8) Recourse may be had to ordinary courts of law.
<H3><A NAME="nr8">Section </A>8 Compensation by private bodies
</H3>

<P>
If a data subject asserts a claim against a private body for compensation
because of automated data processing that is inadmissible or incorrect
under this Act or other data protection provisions and if it is
disputed whether the harm caused results from a circumstance for
which the controller of the data file is responsible, the burden
of proof shall rest with the controller of the data file.
<H3><A NAME="nr9">Section </A>9 Technical and organizational measures
</H3>

<P>
Public and private bodies processing personal data either on their
own behalf or on behalf of others shall take the technical and
organizational measures necessary to ensure the implementation
of the provisions of this Act, in particular the requirements
set out in <A HREF="#an">the annex</A> to this Act. Measures shall
be required only if the effort involved is reasonable in relation
to the desired level of protection.
<H3><A NAME="nr10">Section </A>10 Establishment of automated retrieval
procedures</H3>

<P>
(1) An automated procedure for the retrieval of personal data
may be established in so far as such procedure is appropriate,
having due regard to the legitimate interests of the data subjects
and to the duties or business purposes of the bodies involved.
The provisions on the admissibility of retrieval in a particular
case shall remain unaffected.
<P>
(2) The bodies involved shall ensure that the admissibility of
the retrieval procedure can be monitored. <b> For such purpose they
shall specify in writing:</b>
<P>
1. the reason for and purpose of the retrieval procedure,
<P>
2. the data recipient,
<P>
3. the type of data to be communicated,
<P>
4. the technical and organizational measures required under section
9 of this Act.
<P>
In the public sector the supervisory authorities may lay down
such specifications.
<P>
(3) In cases where the bodies mentioned in section 12 (1) of this
Act are involved, the Federal Commissioner for Data Protection
shall be notified of the establishment of retrieval procedures
and of the specifications made under paragraph 2 above. The establishment
of retrieval procedures in which the bodies mentioned in sections
6 (2) and 19 (3) of this Act are involved shall be admissible
only if the federal or Land ministers responsible for the controller
of the data file and for the retrieving body or their representatives
have given their consent.
<P>
(4) Responsibility for the admissibility of retrieval in a particular
case shall rest with the recipient. The controller of the data
file shall examine the admissibility of retrieval only if there
is cause for such examination. The controller of the data file
shall ensure that the communication of personal data can be ascertained
and checked at least by means of suitable sampling procedures.
If all personal data are retrieved or communicated (batch processing),
it shall be sufficient to ensure that the admissibility of the
retrieval or communication of all data can be ascertained and
checked.
<P>
(5) Paragraphs 1 to 4 above shall not apply to the retrieval of
data that anybody may use either without or after special permission.
<H3><A NAME="nr11">Section </A>11 Commissioned processing or use
of personal data</H3>

<P>
(1) Where other bodies are commissioned to process or use personal
data, responsibility for compliance with the provisions of this
Act and with other data protection provisions shall rest with
the principal. The rights referred to in sections 6 to 8 of this
Act shall be asserted vis-&agrave;-vis the principal.
<P>
(2) The agent shall be carefully selected, with particular regard
for the suitability of the technical and organizational measures
taken by him. The commission shall be given in writing, specifying
the processing and use of the data, the technical and organizational
measures and any subcommissions. In the case of public bodies,
the commission may be given by the supervisory authority.
<P>
(3) The agent may process or use the data only as instructed by
the principal. If he thinks that an instruction of the principal
infringes this Act or other data protection provisions, he shall
point this out to the principal without delay.
<P>
(4) For the agent the only applicable provisions other than those
of sections 5, 9, 43 (1), (3) and (4) as well as sections 44 (1),
Nos. 2, 5, 6 and 7 and (2) of this Act shall be the provisions
on data protection control or supervision, namely for
<P>
1. a) public bodies,
<P>
b) private bodies where the public sector possesses the majority
of shares or votes and where the principal is a public body,
<P>
sections 18, 24 to 26 of this Act or the relevant data protection
laws of the L&auml;nder,
<P>
2. other private bodies in so far as they are commissioned to
process or use personal data in the normal course of business
as service enterprises, sections 32, 36 to 38 of this Act.
<H4>Part II Data processing by public bodies</H4>

<H4>Chapter I Legal basis for data processing</H4>

<H3><A NAME="nr12">Section </A>12 Scope</H3>

<P>
(1) The provisions of this Part shall apply to public bodies of
the Federation in so far as they do not participate in competition
as public-law enterprises.
<P>
(2) Where data protection is not governed by Land legislation,
sections 12 to 17, 19 and 20 of this Act shall also apply to public
bodies of the L&auml;nder in so far as they
<P>
1. execute federal law and do not participate in competition as
public-law enterprises or
<P>
2. act as bodies of the judicature and are not dealing with administrative
matters.
<P>
(3) Section 23 (4) of this Act shall apply mutatis mutandis to
Land commissioners for data protection.
<P>
(4) If personal data are processed or used for the purpose of
past, present or future service or employment contracts, section
28 (1) and (2), No. 1, as well as sections 33 to 35 of this Act
shall apply instead of sections 14 to 17, 19 and 20.
<H3><A NAME="nr13">Section </A>13 Collection of data</H3>

<P>
(1) The collection of personal data shall be admissible if knowledge
of them is needed to perform the duties of the bodies collecting
them.
<P>
(2) Personal data shall be collected from the data subject. They
may be collected without his participation only if
<P>
1. a legal provision prescribes or peremptorily presupposes such
collection or
<P>
2. a) the nature of the administrative duty to be performed necessitates
collection of the data from other persons or bodies or
<P>
b) collection of the data from the data subject would necessitate
disproportionate effort
<P>
and there are no indications that overriding legitimate interests
of the data subject are impaired.
<P>
(3) If personal data are collected from the data subject with
his knowledge, he shall be informed of the purpose of collection.
If they are collected from the data subject pursuant to a legal
provision which makes the supply of particulars obligatory or
if such supply is the prerequisite for the granting of legal benefits,
the data subject shall be informed that such supply is obligatory
or voluntary, as the case may be. At his request he shall be informed
of the legal provision and of the consequences of withholding
particulars.
<P>
(4) Where personal data are collected from a private body and
not from the data subject, such body shall be informed of the
legal provision requiring the supply of particulars or that such
supply is voluntary, as the case may be.
<H3><A NAME="nr14">Section </A>14 Storage, modification and use
of data</H3>

<P>
(1) The storage, modification or use of personal data shall be
admissible where it is necessary for the performance of the duties
of the controller of the data file and if it serves the purposes
for which the data were collected. If there has been no preceding
collection, the data may be modified or used only for the purposes
for which they were stored.
<P>
(2) Storage, modification or use for other purposes shall be admissible
only if
<P>
1. a legal provision prescribes or peremptorily presupposes this,
<P>
2. the data subject has consented,
<P>
3. it is evident that this is in the interest of the data subject
and there is no reason to assume that he would withhold consent
if he knew of such other purpose,
<P>
4. particulars supplied by the data subject have to be checked
because there are actual indications that they are incorrect,
<P>
5. the data can be taken from generally accessible sources or
the controller of the data file would be entitled to publish them,
unless the data subject clearly has an overriding legitimate interest
in excluding the change of purpose,
<P>
6. this is necessary to avert substantial detriment to the common
weal or any other immediate threat to public safety,
<P>
7. this is necessary to prosecute criminal or administrative offences,
to implement sentences or measures as defined in section 11 (1),
No. 8 of the Penal Code or reformatory or disciplinary measures
as defined in the Youth Courts Act, or to execute decisions imposing
administrative fines,
<P>
8. this is necessary to avert a grave infringement of another
person's rights or
<P>
9. this is necessary for the conduct of scientific research, scientific
interest in conduct of the research project substantially outweighs
the interest of the data subject in excluding the change of purpose,
and the research purpose cannot be attained by other means or
can be attained thus only with disproportionate effort.
<P>
(3) Processing or use for other purposes shall not be deemed to

1. stored data concerning him, including any reference in them
to their origin or recipient, and
<P>
2. the purpose of storage.
<P>
The request should specify the type of personal data on which
information is to be provided. If the personal data are stored
in records, information shall be provided only in so far as the
data subject supplies particulars making it possible to locate
the data and the effort needed to provide the information is not
out of proportion to the interest in such information expressed
by the data subject. The controller of the data file shall exercise
due discretion in determining the procedure for providing such
information and, in particular, the form in which it is provided.
<P>
(2) Paragraph 1 above shall not apply to personal data which are
stored merely because they may not be erased due to legal, statutory
or contractual provisions on their preservation or exclusively
serve purposes of data security or data protection control.
<P>
(3) If the provision of information relates to the communication
of personal data to authorities for the protection of the constitution,
to the Federal Intelligence Service, the Federal Armed Forces
Counterintelligence Office and, where the security of the Federation
is concerned, other authorities of the Federal Ministry of Defence,
it shall be admissible only with the consent of such bodies.
<P>
(4) Information shall not be provided if
<P>
1. this would be prejudicial to the proper performance of the
duties of the controller of the data file,
<P>
2. this would impair public safety or order or otherwise be detrimental
to the Federation or a Land or
<P>
3. the data or the fact that they are being stored must be kept
secret in accordance with a legal provision or by virtue of their
nature, in particular on account of an overriding justified interest
of a third party,
<P>
and for this reason the interest of the data subject in the provision
of information must be subordinated.
<P>
(5) Reasons need not be stated for the refusal to provide information
if the statement of the actual and legal reasons on which the
decision is based would jeopardize the purpose pursued by refusing
to provide information. In such case it shall be pointed out to
the data subject that he may appeal to the Federal Commissioner
for Data Protection.
<P>
(6) If no information is provided to the data subject, it shall
at his request be supplied to the Federal Commissioner for Data
Protection, unless the relevant supreme federal authority determines
in a particular case that this would jeopardize the security of
the Federation or a Land. The communication from the Federal Commissioner
to the data subject must not allow any conclusions to be drawn
as to the knowledge at the disposal of the controller of the data
file, unless the latter consents to more extensive information
being provided.
<P>
(7) Information shall be provided free of charge.
<H3><A NAME="nr20">Section </A>20 Correction, erasure and blocking

(3) Instead of erasure, personal data shall be blocked in so far
as
<P>
1. preservation periods prescribed by law, statutes or contracts
rule out any erasure,
<P>
2. there is reason to assume that erasure would impair legitimate
interests of the data subject or
<P>
3. erasure is not possible or is only possible With disproportionate
effort due to the specific type of storage.
<P>
(4) Personal data in data files shall also be blocked if the data
subject disputes that they are correct and it cannot be ascertained
whether they are correct or incorrect.
<P>
(5) Personal data in records shall be blocked if the authority
ascertains in the particular case that, without blocking, legitimate
interests of the data subject would be impaired and the data are
no longer required for the performance of the authority's duties.
<P>
(6) Blocked data may be communicated or used without the consent
of the data subject only if
<P>
1. this is indispensable for scientific purposes, for use as evidence
or for other reasons in the overriding interests of the controller
of the data file or a third party and
<P>
2. communication or use of the data for this purpose would be
admissible if they were not blocked.
<P>
(7) If necessary to protect legitimate interests of the data subject,
the correction of incorrect data, the blocking of disputed data
and the erasure or blocking of data due to inadmissible storage
shall be notified to the bodies to which these data are transmitted
