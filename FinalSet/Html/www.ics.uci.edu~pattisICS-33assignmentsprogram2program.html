This programming assignment is designed first to ensure that you know how to
  write a simple (numeric) class that overloads many of the standard Python
  operators by defining various double-underscore methods.
It also ensures that you know how to write a class that implements iterators,
  by defining both the <b>__iter__</b> and <b>__next__</b> methods.
Finally it ensure that you know how to write iterator decorators by using
  special generators (similar to functions, but using <b>yield</b> instead of
  <b>return</b>) in a module.
<p>
There are three separate parts to this assignment.
In the first part you will write a module defining a single, large numeric
  class that overloads many operators (including those performing arithmetic
  and relational comparisons).
In the second part you will write a medium-size class, which defines various
  methods, including some double-underscore methods and specifically the
  iterator protocol methods (<b>__iter__</b> and <b>__next__</b>).
In the third part you will write a module that defines various iterator
  decorators implemented by generators: each iterator decorator has argument(s)
  that are iterators and is itself used an iterator.
<p>
You should download the 
  <a href="program2.zip">program2</a> project folder and unzip it to produce
  an Eclipse project with three modules.
You will write classes in the first two modules, which can be tested in the
  standard driver using the batch self-check files I supplied; you will write
  generators in the third module, which can also be tested by a batch self-check
  I supplied, but can are tested by a special <b>generatordriver.py</b> module
  included in this project.
Eventually you will submit each of the three modules you write separately to
  Checkmate.
<p>
It is recommend that you work on this assignment in pairs, with someone in your
  lab section.
Try to find someone who lives near you, with similar programming skills,
  and work habits/schedule: e.g., talk about whether you prefer to work
  mornings, nights, or weekends; what kind of commitment you will make to submit
  program early.
<!---
If you believe that it is impossible for you to work with someone, because of
  some special reason(s), you should send me email stating them and asking for
  special permission to work alone (which I do grant, but not frequently).
--->
<p>
<b>Only one student should submit all parts of the the assignment</b>, but both
  student's names should appear in the comments at the top of
  <b>each submitted .py</b> file.
It should look something like
<pre><b>
# Romeo Montague, Lab 1
# Juliet Capulet, Lab 1
# We certify that we worked cooperatively on this programming
#   assignment, according to the rules for pair programming</b></pre>
If you do not know what the terms <b>cooperatively</b> and/or
  <b>rules for pair programming</b> mean, please read about
  <a href="../../../common/handouts/pairprogramming.html">Pair Programming</a> 
  before starting this assignment.
Please turn in each program <b>as you finish it</b>, so that I can accurately
  assess the progress of the class as a whole during this assignment.
<p>
Print this document and carefully read it, marking any parts that contain
  important detailed information that you find (for review before you turn in
  the files).
The code you write should be as compact and elegant as possible, using 
  appropriate Python idioms.

<td width ="80%">
<h3>Problem Summary:</h3>
Write a class that represents and defines operators for <b>Rational</b>
      numbers, which are represented by an <b>int</b> numerator and denominator.
    With this class we can write scripts manipulating this new numeric type,
      which unlike floats performs exact numeric calculations.
    For example
<b><pre>  x = 0
  for i in irange(1,10): x += 1/10
  print(x) # prints 0.9999999999999999

  x = Rational(0)
  for i in irange(1,10): x += Rational(1,10)
  print(x) # prints 1/1

  print(compute_e(100 ))                 # e ~ 1/0! + 1/1! + 1/2! + ... 1/100!
  print(compute_e(100).approximate(100)) # if you write approximate: extra credit

(which prints... look for the / as the 10th character on the 3rd line)

  3535475945713821785251664274</b></pre>
<h3>Details</h3>
<ul>
<li>Define a class named <b>Rational</b> in a module named <b>rational.py</b>
<p>
<li>Write the <b>_gcd</b> (greatest common divisor) algorithm in a class
      method and call it as needed in the <b>__init__</b> method.
    The algorithm for compuing the gcd of two positive integers x and y is:
<b><pre>  while y != 0:
      x, y = y, x%y</pre></b>
    Where the result (gcd of the original x and y) is stored as the final value
      of x after the loop terminates.
    Eclipse complains about all class methods (those without a <b>self</b>
      parameter), but ignore that error (and the script should still run if
      you wrote <b>_gcd</b> correctly).
    You can also annotate the method with <b>@staticmethod</b> to 
      stop Eclipse complaining about the error.
<p>
<li><b>__init__</b> has two parameters, the numerator then denominator of the
       rational number being constructed (use default values of <b>0</b> and
       <b>1</b> respectively, so just as <b>int()</b> is <b>0</b>,
       <b>Rational()</b> is <b>0/1</b> (this is how it will print with
       <b>__str__</b> method described below).
    This method sholuld raise <b>AssertionError</b>(s) if either parameter is
      not an <b>int</b> or if the denominator is <b>0</b>.
    All exceptions should be raised in the form <b>Class.method description</b>,
      where <b>description</b> includes the relevant values underlying the
     error.
    <p>
    Objects in the <b>Rational</b> class are immutable: the methods you will
       write should never bind any instance variables (except  <b>__init__</b>,
       which initializes them) but exclusively returns newly constructed
       <b>Rational</b> objects.
    I suggest using the instance variables <b>num</b> and <b>denom</b>.
    <p>
    The following <b>data invariants</b> should be implemented in
       <b>__init__</b> for representing rational numbers; you can use these
       invariants to help simplify the code in the methods you will write.
    <ol>
    <li>Zero is always represented by <b>0/1</b>
    <li>The denominator is always positive; rational numbers are negative or
           positive based on the sign of their numerator
    <li>The numerator and denominator are stored in the lowest possible terms:
          they have no factors in common (use <b>gcd</b> to establish this data
          invariant).
    </ol>
    <p>
    For example, <b>print(Rational(6,-8))</b> prints <b>-3/4</b> (see
       <b>__str__</b> below): the numerator is negative and the numerator and
       denominator have no common factors.
<p>
<li><b>__repr__</b> returns a string, which when passed to <b>eval</b> returns
         a newly constructed rational with the same value (<b>==</b>) to the
         object <b>__repr__</b> was called on.
    <b>__repr__(Rational(1,2))</b> returns <b>'Rational(1,2)'</b>.
<p>
<li><b>__str__</b> returns a string, with the (signed) numerator and the
      denominator (always positive) separated by a slash(/); see examples of
      of printing a <b>Rational</b> above.
<p>
<li>Write all the underscore methods needed to ensure the prefix +/- work
      correctly.
<p>
<li>Write all the underscore methods needed to ensure that the add, subtract,
      multiply, and true-divide (<b>/</b>) operators produce the correct
      answers when their operands are any combination of <b>Rational</b> and
      <b>int</b> values.
    Hint: When mixing types, convert the <b>int</b> to an equivalent
      <b>Rational</b> and then perform the operation: e.g., <b>5</b>
      converts to <b>Rational(5,1)</b>.
    If Python tries to apply an arithmetic operator to a <b>Rational</b> and
      any other type of value (besides <b>Rational</b> or <b>int</b>) raise the
      standard
      <b>TypeError</b> with the standard messsage about unsupported operand
      types: see what <b>1+'a'</b> produces.
    Hint: I wrote a class method (and annotationed it as a <b>@staticmethod</b>)
      to check and raise these kinds of exceptions.
<p>
<li>Write the underscore method that allows us to raise a <b>Rational</b> to any
       <b>int</b> power (positive or negative): e.g.,
       <b>print(Rational(1,2)**10)</b> prints  <b>1/1024</b> and
       <b>print(Rational(2,1)**-2)</b> prints <b>1/4</b>.
<p>
<li>Write all the underscore methods needed to ensure that we can compare two
       <b>Rational</b>s with the six standard relational operators, with any
       combination of <b>Rational</b> and <b>int</b> (as with the arithmetic
       operators).
    If Python tries to compare a <b>Rational</b> with any other type of value
      raise the standard <b>TypeError</b> with the standard messsage about 
      unorderable types.
    Hint: I wrote a class method (and annotationed it as a <b>@staticmethod</b>)
      to check and raise these kinds of exceptions.
<p>
<li>Python automatically provides meanings for <b>+=</b>, <b>-=</b>, 
      <b>*=</b>, <b>/=</b>, and <b>**=</b>; ensure they are correct or rewrite
      the needed underscore methods.
<p>
<li>Ensure that the <b>abs</b> function works on rationals and that the boolean
      intepretation of a rational is <b>0/1</b> is <b>False</b> and any non-zero
      value is <b>True</b>.
<li>Write the <b>__setattr__</b> method so that after the <b>num</b> and
       <b>denom</b> instances variables are set in <b>__init__</b> trying
       to change them will raise the <b>NameError</b> exception with an
       appropriate message about which instance variable was attempted to
       be changed.
<p>
<li><b>Extra credit</b>:
  <ul>
    <li>Write a method name <b>approximate</b> that returns a string showing the
          decimal approximation of the <b>Rational</b> to the specified
          number of decimal places.
        So, <b>Rational(1,123).approximate(10)</b> returns <b>'.0081300813'</b>.
        Hint: deal with the sign of the result, the integer part, and the
         decimal part separately (my code was 10 lines).
    <li>Write a class method named <b>best_approximation</b> whose argument
          an <b>int</b>. 
        Return a rational number closest to the one this method is called on,
          subject to the requirement that its numerator and denominator contain
          no more digits than the integer argument.
        For example <b>Rational(314159,100000).best_approximation(2)</b> returns
           <b>22/7</b> (the best approximation of &pi; using 2 digit numbers).
  </ul>
<p>
The <b>Rational</b> class I am asking you to write duplicates the functionality
  of the <b>Fraction</b> class currently available in Python.
<b>You may not use the Fraction class, nor the Decimal class in any of your
   code</b>


<h3>Testing</h3>
The <b>rational.py</b> module includes a script that calls
  <b>driver.driver()</b>.
The project folder contains a <b>bsc1.txt</b> file (examine it) to use for
   batch-self-checking your class.
These are rigorous but not exhaustive tests.
Incrementally write and test your class: for example, getting one arithmetic
  operator working correctly will create a pattern for the others.
<p>
Note that when exceptions are raised, they are printed by the driver but the 
  <b>Command:</b> prompt sometimes appears misplaced.
<p>
You can write other code at the bottom of your <b>rational.py</b>
  module to test the <b>Rational</b> class, or type code into the driver
  as illustrated below.
Notice the default for each command is the command previously entered.
<b><pre>  Driver started
  Command[!]: from rational import Rational as Rat
  Command[from rational import Rational as Rat]: x = Rat(1,2)
  Command[x = Rat(1,3)]: y = Rat(1,3)
  Command[y = Rat(1,3)]: print(x+y)
  5/6
  Command[print(x+y)]: print(-x)
  -1/2
  Command[print(-x)]: print(x+2*y)
  7/6
  Command[print(x+2*y)]: print(x > y)
  True
  Command[print(x > y)]: from Rational import compute_e
  Command[from Rational import compute_e]: print(compute_e(10))
  9864101/3628800
  Command[print(compute_e(10))]: print(x+1.)
  Traceback (most recent call last):

<td width ="80%">
<h3>Problem Summary:</h3>
Write a class that represents and defines methods, operators, and iterators
  for a <b>Bag</b> class.
Bags are similar to sets, and have similar operations (of which we will
  implement just the most important) but they can store multiple copies of
  items.
Fundamentally, we will store bags as dictionaries (use <b>defaultdict</b>)
   whose elements are keys and whose values are the number of times the key
   occurs in the bag.
<b>You must store Bags using this data type as specified</b>
<h3>Details</h3>
<ul>
<li>Define a class named <b>Bag</b> in a module named <b>bag.py</b>
<p>
<li>Define an <b>__init__</b> method that has one parameter, an iterable of
       values that initalize the bag.
    Writing <b>Bag()</b> constructs an empty bag.
    Writing <b>Bag(['d','a','b','d','c','b','d'])</b> construct a bag with
      one <b>'a'</b>, two <b>'b'</b>s, one <b>'c'</b>, and three <b>'d'</b>s.
<p>
<li>Define a <b>__repr__</b> method that returns a string, which when passed to
       <b>eval</b> returns a newly constructed bag with the same value
       (<b>==</b>) to the object <b>__repr__</b> was called on.
    For example, for the <b>Bag</b> in the discussion of <b>__init__</b> the
        <b>__repr__</b> method would print its result as
       <b>Bag(['a', 'c', 'b', 'b', 'd', 'd', 'd'])</b>.
    Bags like sets are not sorted, so these 7 values can appear in any order.
    We might require that information in the list is sorted, but not all values
      we might put in a bag may be ordered (and therefore not sortable).
<p>
<li>Define a <b>__str__</b> method that returns a string that more compactly
      shows a bag.
    For example, for the <b>Bag</b> in the discussion of <b>__init__</b> the
        <b>__str__</b> method would print its result as
       <b>Bag(a[1], c[1], b[2], d[3])</b>.
    Bags like sets are not sorted, so these 7 values can appear in any order.
<p>
<li>Define a <b>__len__</b> method that returns the total number of values in
      the <b>Bag</b>.
    For example, for the <b>Bag</b> in the discussion of <b>__init__</b> the
        <b>__len__</b> method would return <b>7</b>.
<p>
<li>Define a <b>unique</b> method that returns the number of different (unique)
       values in the <b>Bag</b>.
    For example, for the <b>Bag</b> in the discussion of <b>__init__</b> the
        <b>unique</b> method would return <b>4</b>, because there are four
        different values in the <b>Bag</b>; contrast this method with
        <b>__len__</b>.
<p>      
<li>Define a <b>__contains__</b> method that returns whether or not its
      argument is in the <b>Bag</b> (one or more times).
<p>
<li>Define a <b>count</b> method that returns the number of times its argument
      is in the <b>Bag</b>: <b>0</b> if the argument is not in the <b>Bag</b>.
<p>
<li>Define an <b>add</b> method that adds its argument to the <b>Bag</b>: if
      that value is already in the <b>Bag</b>, its count is incremented by
      <b>1</b>; if it is not already in the <b>Bag</b>, it is added to the
      <b>Bag</b> with a count of <b>1</b>.
<p>
<li><b>remove</b> removes its argument from the <b>Bag</b>: if that value is
        already in the <b>Bag</b>, its count is decremented by <b>1</b> (and if
        the count reduces to <b>0</b> it is removed from the <b>dict</b>; if it
        is not in the <b>Bag</b>, raise a <b>ValueError</b> exception, with an
        appropriate message that includes the value that could not be removed.
<p>
<li>Define <b>__eq__</b>/<b>__ne__</b> methods that return whether one
      <b>Bag</b> is equal/not equal to another: contains the same values the
      same number of times.
    Comparing a <b>Bag</b> for equality to a non-<b>Bag</b> should raise a
       <b>TypeError</b>.
    Be careful and ensure that this method does not change either <b>Bag</b>.
<p>
<li>Define an <b>__iter__</b> method that that returns an object on which
      <b>next</b> can be called to produce every value in the <b>Bag</b>: all
      <b>len</b> of them.
    For example, for the <b>Bag</b> in the discussion of <b>__init__</b>, 
      the following code
<b><pre>  for i in x:
      print(i,end='')</pre></b>
would print
<b><pre>  acbbddd</pre></b>
    Bags like sets are not sorted, so these 7 values can appear in any order.
<p>
Ensure that the iterator produces those values in the <b>Bag</b> at the time
      the iterator starts executing; so mutating the <b>Bag</b> during
      iteration will <b>not</b> affect what values it produces.
<p>
   Hint: I defined a generator as a class method to do this job.
</ul>
I have shown only examples of <b>Bag</b>s storing strings, because they are
  convenient to write.
But bags can store any type of data.
The <b>__repr__</b>, <b>__str__</b>, and <b>__iter__/__next__</b> methods must
  be written independently: neither should call the other to get things done.
<p>
<h3>Testing</h3>
The <b>bag.py</b> module includes a script that calls <b>driver.driver()</b>.
The project folder contains a <b>bsc2.txt</b> file (examine it) to use for
   batch-self-checking your class.
These are rigorous but not exhaustive tests.
Incrementally write and test your class; check each method as you write it.
<p>
Note that when exceptions are raised, they are printed by the driver but the 
  <b>Command:</b> prompt sometimes appears misplaced.
<p>
You can write other code at the bottom of your <b>bag.py</b> module to test the
  <b>Bag</b> class, or type code into the driver as illustrated below.
Notice the default for each command is the command previously entered.
<b><pre>  Driver started
  Command[!]: from bag import Bag
  Command[from bag import Bag]: b = Bag(['d','a','b','d','c','b','d'])
  Command[b = Bag(['d','a','b','d','c','b','d'])]: print(b)
  Bag(a[1], b[2], c[1], d[3])
  Command[len(b)]: print(len(b))
  7
  Command[print(len(b))]: print(b.count('d'))
  3
  Command[print(b.count('d'))]: quit
  Driver stopped</pre></b>

<td width ="80%">
<h3>Problem Summary:</h3>
Write the following iterator decorators (iterators that operate on iterators)
  using Python generators.
Write each function to be self contained, not calling any other functions or
  generators and do not use  <b>itertools.py</b> module (or any other module
  that would trivialize this code); you may also not call the <b>zip</b>
  function.
Note that the argument passed to these generators can be anything that we can
  iterate: that includes strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and other
  generators: so, you cannot compute the <b>len</b> of the parameter because
  although strings, lists, tuples, and dictionariess have simple to compute
  lengths, generators don't.
<ul>
<li><b>transform</b> takes any iterable and any function whose domain includes
      all the iterated values: it produces transformed (by the function)
      values. For example
<b><pre>  for i in transform('abCdeFg',str.upper):
      print(i,end='')</pre></b>
   produces the values <b>'A'</b>, <b>'B'</b>, <b>'C'</b>, <b>'D'</b>,
     <b>'E'</b>, <b>'F'</b>, and <b>'G'</b>.
<p>
<li><b>running_count</b> takes any iterable and any predicate function
      (taking one argument and returning a <b>bool</b> value): it produces a
      running count of how many values up to (and including) the one just
      iterated over, satisfied the predicate. For example
<b><pre>  for i in count('bananastand', lambda x : x in 'aeiou'): # is vowel
    print(i,end=' ')</pre></b>
   produces the values <b>0</b>, <b>1</b>, <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>2</b>,
      <b>3</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>4</b>, and <b>4</b>.
<p>
<li><b>n_with_pad</b> takes any iterable, an int <b>n</b> and a <b>pad</b> 
      (whose default value is <b>None</b>): it produces the first <b>n</b>
      values from the iterable, padded by <b>pad</b> if there are fewer than
     <b>n</b> values in the iterable.
<b><pre>  for i n_with_pad('abcdefg',3):
    print(i,end=' ')</pre></b>
   produces the values <b>'a'</b>, <b>'b'</b> and <b>'c'</b>
<b><pre>  for i n_with_pad('abcdefg',10,'?'):
    print(i,end=' ')</pre></b>
   produces the values <b>'a'</b>, <b>'b'</b>, <b>'c'</b>, <b>'d'</b>,
   <b>'e'</b>, <b>'f'</b>, <b>'g'</b>, <b>'?'</b>, <b>'?'</b> and <b>'?'</b>.
   Hint: use a <b>for</b> loop with a <b>try/catch</b> and explicit calls to
   <b>iter</b> and <b>next</b>.
<p>
<li><b>sequence</b> takes any number of iterables as parameters: it produces
     all the values in the first iterable, followed by all in the second, ... ,
     all values in the last iterable. For example
<b><pre>  for i in sequence('abcd','ef','ghij'):
      print(i,end='')</pre></b>
     produces the values <b>'a'</b>, <b>'b'</b>, <b>'c'</b>, <b>'d'</b>,
     <b>'e'</b>, <b>'f'</b>, <b>'g'</b>, <b>'h'</b>, <b>'i'</b>, and <b>'j'</b>.
<p>
<li><b>alternate</b> takes any number of iterables as parameters: it produces
     the first value from the first parameter, then the first value from the
     the second parameter, ..., then the first value from the last parameter;
     then the second value from the first parameter, then the second value from
     the the second parameter, ..., then the second value from the last
     parameter; etc. If an iteratable produces no more values, it disappears
     from the alternation, and the process continues until there are no more
     iterables left.
<b><pre>  for i in alternate('abcde','fg','hijk'):
      print(i,end='')</pre></b>
     produces the values <b>'a'</b>, <b>'f'</b>, <b>'h'</b>, <b>'b'</b>,
     <b>'g'</b>, <b>'i'</b>, <b>'c'</b>, <b>'j'</b>, <b>'d'</b>, <b>k</b>, and
     <b>'e'</b>.
   Hint: use a <b>for</b> loop nested in <b>while</b> loop with a
     <b>try/catch</b> and explicit calls to <b>iter</b> and <b>next</b>, along
     with a list of still active iteratables.
<p>
<li><b>Extra credit</b>:
  <ul>
    <li>Write a method name <b>flatten</b> that returns every value nested in
          any iterable data type (except for string: return strings as
          themselves, not their individual characters.
        When iterating through a dictionary, iterated through just its keys.
        For example
<b><pre>  for i in flatten([1,2,[3,4,(5,6,7,{'abc':1,'xyz':2}),8,9],10]):
    print(i,end=' ')</pre></b>
    Prints as: <b>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 xyz abc 8 9 10</b>
    <p>
    Note that this iterator does not control the order that <b>sets</b> or keys
       of <b>dicts</b> are iterated through (we could if we used <b>sorted</b>),
        although iteration through lists and tuples is always sequential.
    Hint: use iteration and recursion and one use of <b>type</b> to check for
      strings.
</ul>
<h3>Testing</h3>
The <b>generator.py</b> module includes a script that calls
  <b>driver.driver()</b>.
The project folder contains a <b>bsc3.txt</b> file (examine it) to use for
   batch-self-checking your class.
These are rigorous but not exhaustive tests.
Incrementally write and test your class; check each function as you write it.
<p>
I have also provided the <b>generatordriver.py</b> module, which has the same
  tests as <b>bsc3.txt</b> but in a form more amenable for debugging these
  generators.
