<P>My name is LaVoyce Loudner, I'm a Lakota Sioux from the Crow Creek Sioux
Reservation in Ft. Thompson South Dakota. I was born in Wesington Springs
SD, on October 10, 1966, I'm the second child of twins, I have a twin brother,
his name is Royce, he is 7 minutes older than me. Besides Royce and I ,
I have two other brothers the first one is Todd Loudner, and Seth Whiting
Jr. I have one sister her name is Dawn Whiting.

<P>I was raised on the Crow
Creek Sioux Reservation all my life. I attended school at Ft. Thompson
Elementary, where I went through grades K-5, my 6th grade year I went to
St. Joesph Indian School in Chamberlain SD, 7th grade I attended at Bismarck
ND, 8th grade at Chamberlain, my freshman year I went to an all girls school
in Springfield SD, 10-12th grades I finished and graduated from Flandreau
Indian School, Flandreau SD. 

<P>Upon finishing high school I got a job working with the JTPA in Ft. Thompson where I worked for a couple of years, and
then thought I would try college, but as luck would have it I had the first
of three children, my oldest Kyle James Loudner is now 11 yrs old, my
second is Kevin Lee St. John he is 10 yrs old, and my baby
her name is Mariah LaRae St. John she is 5 yrs old, they are all awsome
kids and I wouldn't trade them for the world!
<p> When Mariah was 2 yrs old,
Iwas then having a bad relationship and knew my life was headed no
where fast so I decided to go back to college, that was three years ago
I did my first two years at SIPI in Albuquerque NM, where I received my
certificate in Computer Science in May 26, 1996. I then transferred to
United Tribes Technical College in Bismarck ND, where I have finished a
year, and still have a year left before I finish my AAS degrees in Office
Technology and Small Business Management. 
<p> Upon finishing college at Bismarck,
I plan to move to Aberdeen SD and work with the BIA and finish my Bachelors
degree at Northern State University. </P>
