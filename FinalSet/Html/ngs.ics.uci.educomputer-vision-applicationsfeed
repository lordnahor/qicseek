		<description><![CDATA[It is important to achieve success in this area -- it has been &#039;round the corner&#039; way too long.

I do hope that research community becomes less &#039;pure&#039; in their approach and starts paying some attention to applications.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It would be great to see some success in this area.  Like you said, the story certainly does look familiar, but the market today is different than that faced by previous efforts.  Maybe now is the time? Dunno.

Also, the &quot;home and small business&quot; focus they have on their &quot;Product Overview&quot; page is a bit surprising, but maybe it&#039;s  just a vehicle to get start the discussion (seems like there are much higher value markets to pursue).

Definitely something to track going forward ... and it&#039;s nice to see a commercial app that uses Numeta&#039;s HTM technology]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ramesh,

Good to see you back. 

Two things come across my mind with regards to this kind of technology: 

1. I could imagine that media analysis for competitive intelligence purposes could be useful. 

2. Another application could be in the field of sports analysis. 

However, it will take some time until these technology could be used practically.]]></description>
