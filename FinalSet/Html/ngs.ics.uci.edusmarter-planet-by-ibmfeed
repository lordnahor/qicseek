		<description><![CDATA[We are definitely connected more than ever and I think it&#039;s causing more problems than it&#039;s helping, especially in economical/job issues. Everyone used to be able to support themselves by raising their own food, sewing their own clothing, everything. There wasn&#039;t big industry, so thousands of people didn&#039;t lose their jobs at once, and those that did lose a &quot;job&quot; could still move into something else easily while supporting themselves. Today we are so specialized and dependent on others that it&#039;s a disaster if one part of the system breaks down, we don&#039;t have the skills to move on as fast. I think we need to focus more on the people rather than the processes to create a world that is more balanced. We are producing more than we need while there is still hunger, and that&#039;s only one issue we have to deal with.]]></description>
