      I work there as a computer operator assistance
      during school hours and Mr Dodge Chatto right hand. I file paper work,
      and file the videos so they could be easier for him trace. Well he wanted
      me or organize his videos because the teachers are always asking him
      question about the videos now I was doing just about everything for him
      if he had his own personal asssistance working with him.

      I am current a royality member of my community
      as Miss Ramah Navajo. So far I travel all over Western New Mexico. I have
      to show that I am always a leader among my community otherwise they think
      that I was disrespetful while I was representing them. With the title I
      have see many people whom I would keep I touch with because there many
      opportunties out there in the world and such a limited time to focus on.

      Travel to Washinton D.C. Arizona for representing
      my community althouth the former royalities don't think that coming her
      will help me and my community. But in my point of view I think it's a
      great idea so let the world know about out little community outside the
      Navajo Nation itself, we are located on the southeastern side of the
      Navajo Nation.  My interest are running, cooking, and improving my
      education.. So I am looking for a job that will allow me to pursue my
      interests as I continue to improve my writing and computer skills orally
      and verbally.
