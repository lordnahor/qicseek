		<description><![CDATA[Saurav,
If you like to experiment with our system, you can first play a bit with www.seraja.com -- it is still on the web -- and then I can connect you with some people in my group who are working on a open source version of the software.

I would love to see you work with the software. 
Of course, i would love to hear about your research interests in this area -- lets take that on e-mail.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed your talk and the presentation here at the CJ symposium. I could see lots of challenging research opportunities in your talk as a PhD student here at Georgia Tech. There are so many different but related perspectives of the similar problem for creating the grand intelligent semantic web that we all envision.
I look forward to experimenting with the EventWeb system.

Saurav]]></description>
