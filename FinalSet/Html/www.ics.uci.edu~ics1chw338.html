<LI><A NAME="QQ1"><B>If I want to finance my own business, wher 
can I get help in financing the equipment?</B></A><br>

Being an <a 
href="http://akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo/Computers/Internet/Business_and_Economics/">
economics</a> major, starting my own business is something 
that I want to do.  Using Yahoo, I was able to find global leasing
services.  They help finance equipment anywhere in the range of $25,000
to $10 million.  The WWW is very useful in the <a 
href="http://akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo/Business/Business_Schools/> 
business</a> world because it
offers a good supply of resources.  Being well informed and knowing all
your options is key to succeeding in the business world.  It would also
be a good plan to market your company via the WWW because of the amount
of customers you could reach.

<LI><A NAME="QQ2"><B>Where can I get a good pair of deckhand 
boots?</B></A><br>
Izorline International Inc. offers a shorty 100% rubber boot that they
say is perfect for the southern California angler.  A good pair of
deckhand boots are essential when fishing on an <a 
href="http://kingfish.ssp.nmfs.gov/olo.html">ocean</a>.
 <a 
href="http://www.cybermalls.com/cywharf/regal/index."> boat</a> because
keeping dry as well as maintaining good footing is important.  Izorline
also offers many other fishing and boating accessories, and it would be
cool to order things from a computer via mosaic.

<LI><A NAME="QQ3"><B>What is Lynx?</B></A><br>
<A 
href="http://www.cc.ukans.edu/lynx_help/Lynx_users_guide.html">Lynx</a>is 
a browser that is used on the World Wide Web. It is a user friendly 
hypertext interface for users on unix and vms platforms.  It can run 
gopher, HTTP, WAIS, FTP, or NNTP.  Lynx is also a client program.  
Browsers are important for the user to "surf the Web".Other examples of 
browsers such as Lynx are Mosaic and Cello.  We always use Mosaic, but 
why not Lynx?<p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of

<LI><A NAME="QQ4"><B>How many people are affiliated with the 
University of Grenada in Spain?</B></A><br>
There are approximately sixty thousand faculy, students, and staff that 
are currently involved with the <A href=http://www.ugr.es/ugr_es2.htm#HDR 
2 13">University of Grenada</a>.  The university has a rich history, 
being part of the Roman, Islamic, and Nazi empires.  The university also 
has an Economics department, which focuses on the economic situation of 
Europe. This is of interest to me because I would be intersted in going 
to <a href="http://info.swan.ac.uk/ebms/pro0.html">school </a>in Spain. I 
found the university by looking up <a 
href="http://www.uji.es">Spain</a> and 
universities in Yahoo Search.

<LI><A NAME="QQ5"><B>Where could I go to pan for gold in Alaska?</B></A><br>
<a href="http://www.alaska.net/~online/akgold/akgold.html">Adventure</a> 
awaits you in the north.  You could fulfill a fantasy by panning for gold 
in the wilderness by taking the 1995 Alaska Gold Prospecting Adventure. 
By calling the 1-800 number provided, you will see that there is a great 
deal offered.  With all supplies furnished, you not only are guaranteed 
to find gold, but also get to see Alaska and get free fishing lessons!  I 
want to spend my summer in <a href="http://www.alaska.net/">Alaska</a>, 
so I surfed the web and looked for an area of interst.
