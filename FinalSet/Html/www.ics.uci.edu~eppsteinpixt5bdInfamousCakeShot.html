So, I had to shoot the party on manual exposure and a lot of my guesses were pretty far from what they should have been... Camera has gone to the shop and I hope they can fix it.<h5>Taken Friday, February 27, 2004, 10:33:03pm.&nbsp; Original image size: 3072x2048, 7.1Mb<br>Technical details: Canon EOS D60, 2/5s @ F2.8, ISO 100, 28mm/F2.8 (45mm equiv)<br>PS7 CRW 2700:7, 0.15:5:55:65:3:25:0, Crop, USM 30:5</h5></div></body></html>
