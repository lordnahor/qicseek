<LI><A NAME="QQ1"><B>Does the Internet allow me to find 
infomation about Amateur Radio Operators and a directory of 
their calls signs??</B></A><br> My answer is... Of coarse it does!  As I 
was exploring the El Galaxy, I looked under leisure items and found 
Amateur Radio.  From there I ended up getting the low down on everything 
I could want to know about Ham operators.  First I decided to few the 
general heading on <A HREF="http://www.acs.ncsu.edu:80/HamRadio">Amateur 
Radio Information</a>.  This area is a good place to start. From there I 
went to the Amateur Radio Callbook Server and then to MIT's North 
American Call book server which led me to the area where I could <a 
HREF="http:://www.mit.edu:8001/callsign">look up call signs</a>.  So 
naturally I typed in mine first to see how it worked.  I pushed in N6YZZ 
and it pulled up my address, phone number and old call sign.  I checked 
and the rest of my family was in there too.  When I have more time I 
will search into it more indebth.

<LI><A NAME="QQ2"><B>I am going to New York over spring break, can I find 
out what Broadway shows
   will be playing while I am there?</B></A><br>
I am leaving for Rodchester, New York for spring break in March.  My 
answer starts with a story, I am 
saving up money to hopefully go to a Broadway show while I am there.  I 
didn't quite know where I should start so I started on my UCI homepage 
and went down and clicked on to the anchored World Wide Web that was in 
purple.  From there I went to the WWW -The Virtual Tourist which led me 
to a great map of the world that allows me to pick anything to see.  I 
clicked on City Net and on the next screen I was able to pick the region, 
being North America, then US, <A 
HREF="http://www.city.net/countries/united_states/">New York</a> 
and then more specifically between 
Rodchester and downtown.  The Reference Info. puts me right to everything 
I could possibly want to do.  Under Theatres, I found my list of 
theatres and one said <A 
HREF="http://emall.com/ExploreNY/Broadway/Bway1.html">Broadway the Great 
White Way</a>.   
This was only possible through many interesting stops along the 
way. <p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ3"><B>Can I find out some history on my next quarters 
teachers in the area of Social
   Sciences? </B></A><br>
My answer is...start with the home page because it relays 
you to all the useful resources that UC Irvine has to offer.  To find out 
about one's particular field of study I went to the Academic programming 
and research and all of the majors popped up on the screen.  I went 
straight to Social Sciences where I had the choice of choosing between 
information on my specific department of study, graduate studies, info on 
particular areas of study, links to many areas of the school as well as 
faculty and staff information.  <A 
HREF="http://www.socsci.uci.edu/faculty.html">Faculty</a> tells me briefly 
about 
the background or place of study for each individual professor in this 
field.  As I understand it some profesors have chose to enter their 
picture, infromation about themselves and works, and it includes their 
Email and school telephone number.  A good example of a neat profile is 
that of <A 
HREF="http://www.socsci.uci.edu/cogsci/personnel/batchelder/batchelder.html">William 
Batchelder</a>.  I could get lucky and find lots of info on 
my next quarter teachers or Email them if I need to ask any questions. <p><A 
HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ4"><B>Can I find out more about what classes I need to minor in Spanish which is in
   the school of Humanities?</B></A><br>
My answer is...start at home again.  The <a 
HREF="http://www.uci.edu/academic_programs.html">Academic Programs and 
Research</a> is the key area to be at for informations relating to 
information on majors or 
minors.  Going to Humanities then sends me to a gopher menu where I 
choose to look at the <A 
HREF="gopher://uniedit.cwis.uci.edu:7026/00/new.cat/hum/spanish">Spanish 
and Portuguese</a> department.  Once the text 
comes up it doesn't look that exciting but the key point is that in the 
humanities one does not know who the staff is or their backgrounds in 
the lower devision areas.  In the higher levels there are descriptions 
about the classes to take, requirements needed, visting profesors and 
many of the politics.  It basically is an updated version of the UCI 
catalog of background with extra add ons.<p><A

<LI><A NAME="QQ5"><B>I would like to know if there is a way 
that I can find a list of servers, and if so is there one in 
Mexico at the UNAM where my best friend is going to study next 
year?</B></A><br>
My answer is...Yes there is!  First place I started was under Navigate 
and starting points and then to Web Overview with led me to Places to 
start exploring.  Next thing I knew there was a <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/htypertext/DataSources/WWW/Servers.html">lists of 
Servers</a> from around the world.  I naturally clicked to Latin America, 
Mexico and then UNAM the University in which she will be studying.  <a 
HREF="gopher://noc.noc.unam.mx/oo/este_goph">UNAM</a> is a very popular 
University in Mexico and what the server does is hooks me up to a gopher 
that tells me about the school.  Although this is were I do have to bring 
my Spanish skills into action.  I am excited to have found this.  Mosaic, 
known as a browser or server pulls up many wonderful things that I can 
explore. <p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>
