<p>Bren School faculty, students and research initiatives are some of the most well regarded successes on the UC Irvine campus. We are pleased to announce the following noteworthy achievements for 2006.</p>
<p>Awards, grants and other honors can be sent to <a href="mailto: ic%73%6ee%77%73@ics.%75ci%2e%65d%75 ">icsnews@ics.uci.edu </a> to be considered for publication. </p>

                        <strong>Sim</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Assistant professor of informatics <strong>Susan Elliot Sim</strong> has been awarded $5,000 from the Ted and Janice Smith Faculty Seed Fund for her project entitled <i>Maintaining Traceability Links in Extreme Programming</i>.</p>
<p>Traceability is the problem of establishing relationships between products of the development process, for example, predecessor-successor or master-subordinate relationships between requirements and source code. </p>
<p>Currently, associate links between User Stories and code are created during check-in to a revision control system. However, these links are not properly maintained and synchronized as User Stories, test cases, and source code change over time. </p>
<p>Sim has implemented a prototype Eclipse plug-in, STITCH (STory Integration and Tracking for CompreHension) to support traceability under Extreme Programming (XP), an agile software development model that emphasized the ability to adapt to change, by associating User Stories with test cases and source code.</p>
<p>The proposed research project will address this shortcoming by implementing a mechanism to maintain traceability links as the artifacts on either end of the relation evolve.</p>
<p>The competitive Faculty Seed Fund awards provide seed funding for Bren School faculty projects and was made possible through the generous donation of local philanthropists Ted and Janice Smith. </p>

</div>
<p>California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger  announced the appointment of Bren School Dean <strong>Debra J. Richardson</strong> and Calit2 Director Larry Smarr, and   19 other experts to a newly-created, bipartisan Broadband Task Force.		        </p>
<p>The Broadband Task Force will bring together public and private stakeholders to remove barriers to broadband access, identify opportunities for increased broadband adoption and enable the creation and deployment of new advanced communication technologies.  </p>
<p>In October, the Governor signed an Executive Order to clear the government red tape for expanding broadband networks and to create the Broadband Task Force, which was expanded to 21 members earlier this month.		        </p>
<p>"California is number one in so many different things, whether it is biotechnology, stem cell research, protecting our environment, creating jobs or our university system. The Golden State must remain competitive in the telecommunication revolution so that we can continue to attract the best, the brightest and the most creative workforce in the world," said Governor Schwarzenegger.  "Broadband will help build California so we can grow our economy, create great jobs and stay ahead in the global marketplace."
		        </p>
<p>Dean Richardson, 52, came to UCI in 1987 and was appointed chair of the then-department of ICS in July 2000. </p>
<p>Under her leadership, the department was promoted to the first computer science school in University of California history in December 2002. She was named the Ted and Janice Smith Dean of the new school in January 2003. </p>

</div>
<p>Love Singhal, a Ph.D. candidate in computer science, and professor of computer science <strong>Eli Bozorgzadeh</strong> received the Best Paper Award at the 2006 IEEE International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL'06) that took place in Madrid, Spain, August 28-30 2006. </p>
<p>The awarded paper is titled "Multi-layer Floorplanning on a Sequence of Reconfigurable Designs".</p>
<p>The dynamic partial reconfigurability of programmable devices such as FPGAs is characterized by their ability to reconfigure subsets of their logic and routing resources at runtime. </p>
<p>This intrinsic dynamic reconfiguration results in accommodation of complex and dense designs, on-fly adaptivity, and design modification.</p>
<p>In this paper, a new multi-layer sequence-pair-based floorplanner is proposed for a given sequence of reconfigurable designs. In the experiments, compared to a traditional sequential floorplanner, the new floorplanner removes infeasibility in many designs, and provide faster timing closure.</p>
<p>FPL is the largest conference on programmable logic which encompasses a wide range of research area on FPGAs, including applications, novel system architectures and CAD tools, embedded processors, dynamic reconfiguration, etc. </p>
<p>The acceptance rate in FPL 2006 was 28 percent, out of 307 submissions.		        </p>

</div>
<p>Associate professor <strong>Cristina Lopes</strong> recently led Ubicomp 2006, the Eighth International Conference of Ubiquitous Computing, as conference chair. </p>
<p>Ubicomp, hosted by UC Irvine and the Bren School was held September 17-21 at the Newport Beach Marriott.</p>
<p>Ubicomp is the premier international forum for research in ubiquitous computing, bringing together designers, computer scientists, social scientists, and artists, to discuss recent developments and future advance. </p>
<p>Bruce Sterling, a contributing editor of WIRED magazine gave a keynote speech titled Reifying the Fantastic. Sterling is best known for his eight science fiction novels and his nonfiction work including The Hacker Crackdown: Law and Disorder on the Electronic Frontier.  </p>
<p>His keynote address can be <a href="http://luci.ics.uci.edu/blog/archives/2006/09/ubicomp_2006_br_1.html">podcast online</a>. </p>
<p>The ubiquitous computing conference featured high-quality research contributions including: tools and techniques for designing, implementing, and evaluating ubiquitous computing systems;  mobile, wireless, and ad hoc networking infrastructures for ubiquitous computing; laboratory and in situ studies of ubiquitous computing technologies in use; location-aware and context-based systems for ubiquitous computing; and privacy, security, and trust in ubiquitous and pervasive systems. </p>
<p>UbiComp&#8217;s workshop program allowed for small groups to gather for intensive discussion around focused topics of interest. </p>
<p>The goal of workshops was to share understandings and experiences, to foster research communities, to learn from each other and to envision future directions. </p>
<p>Professor <strong>Paul Dourish</strong> and Assistant Professor <strong>Don Patterson</strong> served as Program Chair and Local Arrangements Chair, respectively. </p>
<p>Lopes' research is related to languages and communication systems. The ultimate goal of her research is to deepen the knowledge about communication, in particular in systems that involve humans and machines. </p>
<p>Dourish's primary research interests are in the areas of Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, Human-Computer Interaction, and Ubiquitous Computing. </p>
<p>He is especially interested in the foundational relationships between social scientific analysis and technological design. </p>
<p>Patterson's areas of research interest lie at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Ubiquitous computing and he has applied this work to transportation and activity assistance. </p>

                  Yang</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Xiaowei Yang</strong>, assistant professor of computer science, is the recipient of two NSF awards to study ways to improve Internet architecutre.</p>
<p>The first award, provides $300,000 to NeTS FIND: An Internet Architecture For User Controlled Routes. The project will attempt to develop an Internet architecture that enables users or their end-systems to select the paths their packets take through the network.                </p>
<p>Such user-controlled routes are desirable for both economic and technical reasons.  </p>
<p>Economically, user-controlled routes are a key factor in maintaining the competitiveness of the ISP marketplace, just as long-distance carrier selection has had a lasting impact on telephony.  </p>
<p>Technically, user-controlled routes provide a fundamental means for improving the performance and reliability of network communications. </p>
<p>The second project, awarded $200,000 and entitled a CT-ER: A DoS-Resistant Internet Architecture, funds research to design and evaluate an Internet architecture that is resistant to Denial-of-Service (DoS) flooding attacks of any scale.                </p>
<p>DoS attacks have become an increasing threat to the reliability of the Internet. These attacks are capable of knocking any user, site, and server right off the Internet. </p>
<p>This research targets the root cause of the DoS flooding problem: the network's inability to intelligently handle overload.When DoS attacks occur, the network drops legitimate traffic and attack traffic alike, leading to heavy losses of legitimate traffic. </p>
<p>Yang's research area is in networked and distributed systems, with an emphasis on protocol and architecture design, performance analysis, modeling, and measurement.</p>

                      Alspaugh</p>
</div>
<p>Professors <strong>Thomas A. Alspaugh</strong>, <strong>Cristina V. Lopes</strong> and <strong>Richard Taylor</strong> were recently awarded IBM's Eclipse Innovation Award.  </p>
<p>The Bren School faculty are among 43 recipients of the 2006 award worldwide -- the largest number of honorees of any university.    This brings the total number of Eclipse award winners at UC Irvine to eight, which is also the most of any university worldwide. </p>
<p>The IBM Eclipse Innovation Award program is an international award competition designed to encourage the use of open source and open standards-based tools for academic curricula and research. Qualified faculty and researchers submit proposals for work with applications in teaching, research or community building around Eclipse. </p>
<p>Eclipse is an open universal platform for tool integration - an open extensible Integrated Development Environment (IDE), and an open source community. </p>
<p>The Eclipse community creates royalty-free technology as a universal platform for tools integration. Eclipse-based tools give developers freedom of choice in a multi-language, multi-platform, multi-vendor supported environment supported by multiple vendors. </p>
<p>The operating system platforms that Eclipse has been targeted to includes Windows, Linux, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX, and Mac OS. In addition, Eclipse provides a unique environment for members of the academic community to build new tools for teaching, research, and further growth of the Eclipse community. </p>
<p>Alspaugh's research is in the area of requirements engineering. He is interested in how we can describe and reason about software, especially at points when code has not yet been written or will be re-written, and while the software's specification is still incomplete and its requirements are in flux. His recent work has investigated the use of scenarios to specify the behavior of a system. </p>
<p>Lopes' research is related to languages and communication systems. The ultimate goal of her research is to deepen the knowledge about communication, in particular in systems that involve humans and machines. </p>
<p>Taylor's research is focused on design -- the issues, techniques, and agents involved in creating and evolving software artifacts and processes. Specific emphases include software architecture and architecture-based software development environments. </p>
<p>Past Eclipse award recipients from the Bren School include David Redmiles (2005), Susan Sim (2004, 2005) and Andr&#233; van der Hoek (2004, 2005). </p>

<p>&#8220;This award demonstrates how great the faculty is at the Bren School.&#8221;  Said Gabriela Marcu, a sophomore Informatics major, INSA president and founders.  &#8220;Our faculty help us in our efforts to meet our goals, and always provide advice and support. This is why their involvement has earned them this recognition.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Professor van der Hoek's research lies in the fields of configuration management and software architecture, focusing on two research questions: (1) how to better coordinate the activities of multiple, geographically distributed developers and (2) how to better leverage higher levels of abstraction in designing and implementing software systems. </p>
<p>Van der Hoek also explores how simulation can aid students in learning more about the software engineering process.  </p>
<p>David Kay is a lecturer in computer law, programming languages, social analysis of computerization, human-computer interaction, and communications skills for computer science. </p>
