<H2>CompSci 260 - Fundamentals of the Design and Analysis of Algorithms - Winter, 2013 (Dillencourt)</H2>

<p><b>Note to students who have already taken this course and want to take the
CompSci 260 portion of the masters exam:</b>
In accordance with rules that have been in place since 
Fall 2011, the CompSci 260 portion of the Masters Exam will be integrated 
with the Final Exam.  
<ul>
<li>To read exactly how this will work, click
<a href="mastersfinal.html">here</a>.  
<li>
You must sign up for this exam before the end of the fifth week of classes.
The mechanism and exact deadline for signing up will be posted
<a href="mastersfinalsignup.html">here</a> when it is finalized.
</ul>
<p><b>Course Information:</b></p> 
<UL> 
<LI> Course Instructor: 
<UL> 
<LI> Professor Michael Dillencourt
<LI> Email: dillenco at ics dot uci dot edu
<LI> Office Hours: <a href="../officehrs/">Click here</a>.
I am also available after discussion section for questions.
<LI> Office: DBH 4086
</UL>
<LI> Class meetings:
<UL>
<LI> M W, 5:00PM, ICS 174 (see below for more details)
<LI> The first class meeting will be Monday, January 7.
<LI> There will be no class on the following University holiday:
<UL>
<LI> Monday, January 21 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Day)) 
<LI> Monday, February 18 (Presidents' Day)) 
</UL>
<LI> <b>Note:</b> You are <b>required</b> to enroll in the discussion section 
as well as the lecture.  
<p>Nominally, the class is scheduled to be a 2.5 hour lecture 
followed by a 1-hour discussion.  
This means that the classroom is reserved for 3.5 hours on
Mondays and Wednesdays, until 8:30.  However, you can plan
on the class being done by 7:30, sometimes earlier.  For more details,
read on.</p>
<p>Generally, the plan will be 80 minutes of lecture, followed
by a short break and a discussion.  But this is only
a general plan.  On occasion the lecture may be longer than usual.  
On occasion I may give an additional lecture during the discussion period,
either to make up for a missed lecture or to ensure that we cover the
entire course syllabus.  Quizzes may be given during either the lecture
or the discussion section.</p>  
<p>I do not plan to have any lectures run past 7:30.
The quizzes will be such that they can be
completed by 7:30.
If there is spirited discussion of homework or quiz problems, those could
conceivably run past 7:30.</p>  
<p>While we may not always run until 7:30, if you have even a partial conflict 
with the period from 5-7:30 on Monday and Wednesday you should not take
this course this quarter.
Any request that special allowances be made because a student has such
a conflict will not receive a sympathetic response.</p>
</UL>
<LI> Quizzes: There will be two in-class quizzes, to be held during normal
class time on the following two dates:
<UL>
<LI> Quiz 1:  <b>Wednesday, January 30</b>.  
<LI> Quiz 2:  <b>Wednesday, February 27</b>.

extraordinary circumstances, and they must be approved by the Associate
Dean for Graduate Studies.  
</UL>
<LI> Grading:

<LI> Final exam: 50% 
</UL>
<LI> The policy for assigning grades will be as follows:
<UL>

<LI> Poor performance in the course may result in a grade of C or lower.
<LI> The standard for passing the CompSci 260 portion of the Masters Exam
will be performing at an excellent or superior level (i.e., A- or better)
on the final exam.
<LI> Under certain circumstances, upon request, I may give a grade of 
S or U (Satisfactory of Unsatisfactory) rather than a letter grade.  
Such a grade will be assigned only if you request it and 
I approve your request.  
I will only approve such a request if you have not already taken this class 
in a previous offering.
If you think you might want be assigned an S/U grade instead of a letter
grade, you should talk to me.

<LI> Homework problems
<UL>
<LI> Homework will not be collected and will not be graded.  
<LI> We will discuss the solutions to the homework problems in the 
discussion sections.

</UL>
<LI> Course textbook:
<UL>
<LI> Kleinberg and Tardos, <em>Algorithm Design</em>, Addison Wesley, 2006.
</UL>
The course will cover the first eight chapters of this book, along with a
small number of supplementary readings.
<LI> If you send me email about the course, please do the following
<OL>
<LI>
Please include the string "CompSci 260:" at the start of the subject line 
(to ensure that it gets
past my spam filter). 
<LI>
Please include your name and student number in the message.
<LI>
If you are not writing me from your official UCI email address, please
cc your official UCI email address.
</OL>
(The reason for the first request is self-explanatory.  The second and the
third are because I occasionally get email from non-UCI-students asking for
help on problems, and I want to weed them out.)

<LI>Course announcements will be sent via email to all students enrolled
in the class.
If for some reason you are not receiving these announcements, you can

<LI> Course notes, in the form of transparencies used for the lectures,
will be available on line.  Note that you are responsible for all material
covered in lecture, discussion, and the relevant portions of the textbook,
even if it does not appear in the lecture notes.
