<h3><u><b> P53 Cancer Rescue Project</u></b></h3><br><br>
<img src="imges/p53-2.png" width="800" height="344" alt="demo" />
<p>I'm part of a large collaborative project which spans four Schools at the University of California, Irvine and one School at the University of California, San Diego. Scientists with backgrounds in bioinformatics, biophysics, chemistry, genetics, molecular biology, NMR and structural biology work on this project.</p>

<p>The goal of this collaborative work is providing new therapeutic strategies for those human cancers that carry mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53. p53 is the central tumor suppressor protein. It is estimated that up to 50% of human cancers show evidence of having this protein inactivated due to p53 gene mutations. As a result, restoring function to the inactive mutant p53 protein is a new, powerful therapeutic approach. Small molecules that stabilize the core domain and thus restore function to p53 would have an enormous impact on how successfully cancers with such mutations can be treated.</p> 

<p>Toward this goal, the structural basis of the rescue mechanism(s) is currently being studied. We employ computational methods for molecular modeling and dynamics, computational docking studies using existing compound libraries, and machine learning techniques to predict the p53 protein function with both genetic mutantions and small molecules attached based on p53 protein structural features. We are also exploiting computational modeling studies to identify surface regions of the p53 core domain that are ideal for the binding of small ligands able to stabilize the core domain. These computational studies guide genetic mutation libraries through yeast and human cell assays, screens, and selections, to generate and identify p53 reactivation mutants.</p> 
<p>All source codes and data sets were archived at the open source repository, SourceForge, under the name "p53 Cancer Rescue Project" and uploaded to UCI Machine Learning Archive under the name "P53 Cancer Rescue Structural Data".</p>
<p>The p53 cancer rescue project receives major funding from the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health. Other administrative and financial support comes from the Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics, the Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Institute for Clinical and Translational Science, the Center for Biomembrane Systems, and the Office of Research and Graduate Studies, all at the University of California at Irvine.</p>

<h3><u><b> Computational Analysis of Next Generation Sequencing</u></b></h3>
<p>In this project I'm developing a new computational technique for detecting minor variations in genetically heterogeneous cell populations from next generation sequencing data. Next generation sequencing (NGS) is a developing research area with an extensive growth of applications. NGS has been traditionally used to discover single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In this study NGS data is being used for a potential novel application. </p>
