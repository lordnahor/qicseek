						<p> This term we will be using Piazza for class
						discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you
						help quickly and efficiently from classmates, the TA, and
						myself. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching
						staff, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza.
						If you have any problems or feedback for the developers,
						email team@piazza.com.
						</p>

						<p>Find our Piazza class page at: <a href="https://piazza.com/uci/winter2014/inf141cs121/home">https://piazza.com/uci/winter2014/inf141cs121/home </a>

						<p>A welcome post is up on Piazza.  If you don't see it,
						please investigate the problem so that you do not miss
						required information.</p>
				
						<p>Some announcements will be emailed to your UCI Net ID
						/ Login through the EEE system. Please make sure it is
						set up properly and being forwarded to whichever account
						you normally read email from. Make sure it is not on
						your spam list or being filtered as junk mail.</p>
				
						<p>Many other announcements will be made in class as well.</p>

				<p>Every quarter I fail students for cheating.  Will it be you this quarter?  I hope not.</p>

				<p>Here's my take on academic honesty:  This is not a job.  This is a class.  Someone is paying me to
				make sure that you learn the course material.  When I give you
				assignments, it isn't because I want to know the answer.  I know
				the answer.  I want you to do the hard work of finding out the
				answer in a particular way.  This is how you learn new things.  
				You can give me a "correct" answer that you obtained in an
				incorrect way.  That isn't the goal.  Because, let me say it
				again, I know the
				answer.  Your grade is about you learning.  Academic Honesty is
				about getting the answers in the right way so that you
				actually learn.  Some of the things you do in this class will
				therefore be inefficient and difficult. </p>
 
				<p>You may never use anyone else's work without
				clearly acknowledging the source. This includes code you find on
				the web, text from books, and answers from friends.
				Doing so is called plagiarism.</p>
 
				<p>Plagiarism is any work that you use that you did not create
				and do not credit.  
				If you plagiarize another work without crediting the
				source, you will receive a failing grade for the entire course
				at the discretion of the instructor.  It takes 2 seconds to cite your source. If you want to be
				intellectually lazy, do something else with your life. If you
				forget to do an assignment, consider the trade-off between a zero on
				the assignment (which you didn't turn in) and a zero for the
				whole course (when you turn in a plagiarised piece of work).</p>

				<p>If an assignment specifically requires you to do the work yourself, and you copy
				work from another source, but acknowledge it, then you did not fulfill the
				requirements of the assignment.  It's not plagiarism but it's
				still not doing the assignment correctly.  This is also grounds for
				failing an assignment.</p>
 
				<p>This has happened in my courses before, it has happened in
				conferences that I have chaired and I have sat in conferences in
				which others have presented my work verbatim. In each of these
				cases I took the strongest possible recourse available to me at
				the time. Our global academic system relies on properly
				crediting sources for everything to function. Plus it bugs me.</p>
				
				<p>My colleagues and I have kicked students out of UCI for cheating in our courses.
<a href="http://honesty.uci.edu/blotter.html">Here</a> is a
				list of cheating incidents at UCI that were dealt with at the
				university level.</p>

				<p>Please familiarize yourself with the latest UCI academic
				honesty policy: <a
				href="http://www.editor.uci.edu/catalogue/appx/appx.2.htm">http://www.editor.uci.edu/catalogue/appx/appx.2.htm</a>.</p>
				<p> Please read a more detailed definition of plagiarism defined
				by the ACM: 
				<a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy">http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy</a>. 

				<p> Please <a href="http://youtu.be/1UDZFC9IiLk">watch a tutorial</a> on Academic Honesty at UCI.</p>
