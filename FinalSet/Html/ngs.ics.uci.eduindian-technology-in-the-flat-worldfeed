		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ramesh,
I&#039;m a 35 year old technology worker from Canada working for an ISV. I read a few blogs like yours (link from Rajesh Jain).  I like all  technology in general, and especially intersted in the opportunties (challenges at this point, I believe) of environmental sustainability and what I call &#039;new age energy&#039;.

It would be very interesting to me to understand the implications of low-cost, renewable, on-site power generation. 

As much as cheap computing power and the Internet are enabling Indians to overcome the historic and natural barriers of being a part of the global economy, I actually think that green energy, particular electricity generation, will be a catalyst for growth.

Ive never been to india, but from what I gather, one of the challenges is cheap, reliable power. With so much effort and focus on green technologies for energy production and storage, it&#039;s only a matter of time before the same opportunties that exist in Mumbai can exist anywhere in India.

To compete with me, you need to be able to communicate with my customers, have the same knowledge (education and training), the same tools and infrastructure and access to my customers.

For the past 100 years+ (a guess, sorry, I should have researched that)  you can speak my customer&#039;s language, and for perhaps longer, you have had a culture that prizes education and knowledge. What you lacked was tools and infrastructure (cheap computing and Internet) and access to my customers. 

No other nation that I can think of has all of these necessary ingredients, even China.

Assuming that technologies like photovoltaics, bio-fuels and so on  become affordable, the very last barrier to growth is lifted.]]></description>
