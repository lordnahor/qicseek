Moishe,  i was trying to forward a very long missive from Jehoshua 
"Oscar" Langsam who seems to live in Israel.  He had an interesting take 
on Pesach.  His family lore has it that Pesach is a direct descendant of 
Issachar, son of Jacob.  Though he states that his family is connected 
to Pesach Langsam, he does not say how. What he does know is that his 
grandparents were Hersch and Ruchel Langsam from Blazowa.
     
His father, Aaron, their son, was able to get on an illegal ship from 
Danzig to Palestine with about 1300 others.  The boat was captured and 
detained in Yugoslavia and all were shot by the Nazis.  After the war, 
the bodies were exhumed from their mass grave in Sabac, Yugo. and 
reburied in a Jewish cemetery in Belgrade.
     
His mother, Esther and her two sons waited in Danzig for opportunities 
to flee.  They left with 500 others, the last to successfully leave, on 
a train to Bratislava where they picked up a series of boats.  After 3 
months they arrived in Haifa.  They were detained.  The 3 year boy died 
of typhoid.  Esther and Oscar were exiled to Mauritius until August 
1945.  Esther remarried and had two more children. 
     
Oscar sent a tree but I couldn't read it.  I've asked him to mail it to 
me since we've had such difficulty communicating.
     
I've asked him if he knows more about how his grandfather might have 
been connected to Pesach Langsam's children. As far as I know, his 
family is not in the book. 
     
Suzan

Oscar has a changing site and this is the <a href="oscrsite.htm">link</a> to the basic information he has posted as I downloaded it. Forgive me, but the images do not load. I did not copy them.
