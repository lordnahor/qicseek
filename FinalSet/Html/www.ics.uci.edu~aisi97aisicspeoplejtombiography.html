Hello.  My name is Joycelyn Cheryleen Tom and I am 20 years old.  My
parents' names are Jimmy and Loretta Tom.  My dad works with the Bureau
of Indian Affairs.  He has been with them for over 25 years.  He is
planning on retiring in about 3 more years.  My mom, who has been in
Law Enforcement for 22 years, is now a retired mother.  I am glad she
stays home with us now.  I have one older brother and his name is Rory
Ryan Knight.  He works with the (EMS) Emergency Medical Service. I used
to have an older sister but I lost her in a car accident.  This was
back in November '94. Her name was Penelope Cheryl Tom. She was 20 years
old at the time.  Right now, I have a younger sister.  Her name is
Melody Heather Tom, and she is going to be in junior high school this
coming school year.
