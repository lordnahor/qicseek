<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=7><P>Wiyot Tribal History</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>I am <I>Yurok Indian</I>, however I am in the
<U>Wiyot Tribe</U> because the Yurok and Wiyot tribes joined
(Humbolt county).  The indian in me comes from my dads side of the family.
My grandmother is full-blooded indian and my dad is half.  I never lived on a
reservation, however we have lived near reservations.  I remember living in
Susanville, CA when I was in elementaryf school and needed assistance, or
tutoring, an indian woman would come and help me.  She was very nice and
always went over my work thoroughly with me.  I also remember attending pow
wows at my elementary school.  But we moved to Sacramento, CA when I was in
the 5<SUP>th</SUP> grade and there they didn�t have pow wows at school or
any nearby reservations.</P>
<P>
<B><P>The Wiyot territory</B> is in the Humbolt county area, which starts at
Little River and continues down the coast to Bear River, then inland to the
first set of mountains.  Towns that are within the traditional Wiyot
territory are McKinleyville, Blue Lake, Arcata, Eureka, Kneeland, Loleta,
Fortuna, Ferndale, and Rohnerville.  Rivers within the territory are
Mad River (Batwat), Elk River, Eel River and the Van Duzen River.</P>
<P>
<B><P>Pre 1860 there were approximately 1500 to 2000 Wiyot people living
within this area.</B>  After 1860 there were an estimated population of
200 people left. By 1910 there was an estimate of less than 100 full blood
Wiyot people living within Wiyot territory. This rapid decline in population
was due to disease, slavery, target practice, "protection", and being herded
from place to place, and of course, massacres. </P>
<P>
<B><P>Indian Island</B> was and is the <I>center of Wiyot world</I>. On the
island a ceremonial dance would be held to start the new year. The ceremony
may have been called the World Renewal ceremony. All people were welcomed,
no one was turned away. The ceremony would continue for at least seven to
ten days. It was held at the village site of Tutulwat on the northern part
of the island. Traditionally the men would leave the island and return the
next day with the day�s supplies. The elders, women and children were left
to rest on the island along with a few men.</P>
<P>
<B><P>A massacre took place at such a ceremony in 1860</B>. The leader of the
Humboldt Bay Wiyots was a man named Captain Jim. He was the man who would
organize and lead the ceremony to start a new year.  Captain Jim welcomed all
people, Indian and non-Indian alike.  <I>On February 26, 1860</I>, several
Eureka mean came to the island in the early morning after the ceremony was
completed for the evening. They were armed with hatchets, clubs and knives.
They left their guns behind so the noise would not be as great. This was not
the only massacre that took place that night. Two other village sites were
raided. One on the Eel River and another on the South Spit. Eighty to one
hundred people or more were slain that night. A child, Jerry James (Captain
Jim's son), survived.  (Jerry�s son lives at Table Bluff reservation
today).  For their protection, the Wiyot people were corralled at
Fort Humboldt. This was another California case of the Army protecting
Indians from the violent and barbaric citizens...Then later some were herded
to other Indian centers within California. However, they would keep returning
to their homeland (the above info. was taken from the
