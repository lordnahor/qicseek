The hospital is based around American Indian culture.
Organizations such as Tribal Natives have donated artifacts.
All of the Native American tribes have a template placed hanging on the wall.
Each one is a representitive of their tribe. For example, I am from the
Cherokee tribe so their would be a template of the history of my tribe.
Individualized templates are placed for recognition and to pay a respect to
our ancestors. <br></font>
