<LI>if the member is deleted or moved, the collection typically does not get updated
<UL>
<LI>if the moved/deleted resource and collections containing it as an external member are on the same server, an intelligent server could update collections it controls
<LI>in the general case where the moved/deleted resource and the collection are on different servers, nothing can be done without a server-to-server protocol (out of scope for WebDAV)</UL></UL></UL></P>
