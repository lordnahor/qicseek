<H2>Biconnnected components</H2>

If deleting vertex <I>a</I> from graph G splits the graph
then <I>a</I> is called an <I>articulation point</I> of G.
<P>
This can be formalized by defining: &nbsp;
<I>a</I> is an articulation point of graph G
if and only if there exists vertices <I>v,w</I> such that
<I>v, w, a</I> are distinct and every path from <I>v</I> to <I>w</I>
contains <I>a</I>.
<P>
G is <I>biconnected</I> if and only if there are no articulation
points. &nbsp; That is, it requires deletion of at least 2 vertices
to disconnect G.
<P>
A maximal subgraph of G that is biconnected is called a
<I>biconnected component</I> of G.
<P>
Note that all the edges in a cycle will be in the same
biconnected component. &nbsp;
We can define an equivalence relation on the edges
<I>e</I><sub>1</sub> is equivalent to <I>e</I><sub>2</sub>
if either <I>e</I><sub>1</sub> = <I>e</I><sub>2</sub>
or there exists a cycle including
both <I>e</I><sub>1</sub> and <I>e</I><sub>2</sub>. &nbsp;
This equivalence relation partitions the set of edges into
equivalence classes, where two edges belong to the same equivalence
class if and only if they are equivalent.
<P>
If E is an equivalence class (of edges) and V is the set of
vertices appearing as endpoints of the edges in E
then it will be the case that
the graph (V,E) is a biconnected component of G.
<P>
<B>Lemma</B>. &nbsp; For any connected graph G:<BR>
<OL>
<LI> Any 2 distinct biconnected components have
     at most one vertex in common.
<LI> <I>a</I> is an articulation point of G if and only if
     <I>a</I> is common to more than one of the biconnected components of G.
</OL>
<P>
We will use DFS to find the biconnected components of a graph. &nbsp;
A DFS tree has no cross-edges. &nbsp;
That is, if <I>v</I> is neither an ancestor nor a descendent
of <I>w</I> then there is no edge (<I>v,w</I>).
<P>
If <I>a</I> is an articulation point of graph G then removing <I>a</I>
will split G into two or more parts. &nbsp;
One of these parts will consist of a son of <I>a</I>, <I>s</I>,
together with all of <I>s</I>'s descendents in the DFS tree. &nbsp;
This is summarized in the next lemma.
<P>
<B>Lemma</B>. &nbsp; <I>a</I> is an articulation point of G
if and only if either<BR>
1. <I>a</I> is the root and has more than one son, or<BR>
2. <I>a</I> is not the root, and there exists a son <I>s</I> of <I>a</I>
such that there is no backedge between any descendent of <I>s</I>
(including <I>s</I>) and a proper ancestor of <I>a</I>.
<P>
Define LOW(<I>v</I>) to be the most remote ancestor of <I>v</I>
that can be reached from <I>v</I> if we are allowed to go down the
tree from <I>v</I> and then go up at most one backedge.
<P>
By the lemma, if the vertices are numbered by DFS numbers then:<BR>
if <I>a</I> is not the root then <I>a</I> is an articulation point
if and only if <I>a</I> has a son <I>s</I> such that
LOW(<I>s</I>) &ge; DFN[<I>a</I>].
<P>
We will embed in the DFS algorithm the calculation of LOW,
using the following recurrence.
<P>
LOW(<I>v</I>) = minimum <I>x</I> such that
<table>
<tr><td>either</td>
    <td>1. <I>x</I> = DFN[<I>v</I>]</td>
    <td>(no backedge taken)</td>
<tr><td>or</td>
    <td>2. <I>x</I> = LOW(<I>s</I>), where <I>s</I> is a son of <I>v</I></td>
    <td>(backedge from a proper descendent of <I>v</I>)</td>
<tr><td>or</td>
    <td>3. <I>x</I> = DFN[<I>w</I>], where (<I>v,w</I>) is a backedge</td>
    <td>(backedge from <I>v</I>)</td>
</table>

             T := T union {(v,w)}
             FATHER[w] := v
             SEARCHB(w)
             <B>if</B> LOW[w] &ge; DFN[v] <B>then</B>
                v is an articulation point
                <font color=red>and the next biconnected component is
                the set of edges popped from STACK up to and including (v,w)</font>
2:           LOW[v] := min{ LOW[v], LOW[w] }
          <B>else if</B> w &ne; FATHER[v] <B>then</B>
3:           LOW[v] := min{ LOW[v], DFN[w] }
</PRE>
<P>
The time complexity is <I>O</I>(<I>n</I> + <I>e</I>) because the
changes from simple DFS are LOW computation and STACK manipulations,
each of which takes time <I>O</I>(<I>e</I>).
<P>
One can prove by induction on the number of biconnected components of G
that, when SEARCHB(<I>w</I>) is completed,
if LOW[<I>w</I>] &ge; DFN[<I>v</I>]
then the set of edges above (<I>v,w</I>) on the stack
constitutes the biconnected component containing edge (<I>v,w</I>).
