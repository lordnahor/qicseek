</FONT><FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=4><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Personal data 
laws are becoming increasingly a tool for the overall protection of 
fundamental human rights, thereby adding significantly to the 
conventional privacy framework. The recent Italian Data Protection 
Act (no. 675 of 31.12.1996) regards privacy protection as a part of a 
larger whole-taking also account of guidelines already included in 
the European Directive of 1995: indeed, personal data are to be 
processed "by respecting the rights, fundamental freedoms and dignity 
of natural persons, in particular with regard to privacy and personal 
identity". Thus, privacy becomes a fundamental component of the 
"electronic citizenship" which will be a basic features of the next 
millennium.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This ambitious target cannot be achieved solely 
through an Act ensuring a high level of protection to citizens: 
powerful social legitimation is also required.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The level of protection ensured by the Italian Act 
is considerable. This is partly due to the fact that Parliament chose 
to include, from the very beginning, significant provisions of the EU 
Directive into domestic legislation; hence, the protection of 
personal data processed in Italy is, at least currently, in many 
instances greater than that ensured by countries in which this is 
long-standing practice.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Social legitimation also results from the fact 
that the supervisory authority is direct, exclusive expression of 
Parliamentary activity. The four members of the Supervisory Authority 
(i.e., the "Garante") for Personal Data Protection are elected by 
both Houses, and the chairman is, in turn, elected by the members. 
This means that no undue pressure 1s exercised by Government, which 
obviously enhances the independence of the authority. Further, being 
directly linked to popular sovereignty - through the election by 
Parliament - the authority is especially qualified to carry out 
activities which are aimed, firstly and above all, at protecting 
values and fundamental rights to which all citizens are entitled.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thus, the Garante is not entrusted exclusively 
with the task of monitoring or auditing data hanks: in fact, it has 
considerable power of action, including data hanks to which no 
supervision usually applies (see Article 4). This is the case, for 
instance, of intelligence services, which may not dismiss the 
requests made by the Garante on grounds of State secrecy - as is 
often the case in respect of similar requests made by judicial 
authorities.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Garante is also committed the difficult task 
of striking a balance between diverging interests. This is apparent 
as regards the relationships between privacy and freedom of the 
press, hut also applies to other matters - such as sensitive data; 
processing of such data is allowed only with the data subject's 
consent <U>and</U> with the authorization by the Garante.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Act no. 675 is accompanied by another Act (no. 
676) which provides flexibility and can be said to be a gateway to 
the future. Self-amendment arrangements are provided for: based on 
the experience gained in the implementation of the Act, the 
Government may issue decrees supplementing and/or amending the Act so 
as to bring the latter fully into line with actual requirements. Two 
such decrees have already been issued. Furthermore, the Government 
was enabled to issue, by the end of 1998, a number of decrees which 
should allow supplementing the existing legislation in especially 
complex areas or in sectors showing innovations due to the 
development of information and communication technology. This entails 
the commitment towards laying down provisions applying to the whole 
issue of telematics networks by the term stated - which will prevent 
leaving out the very sectors in which the protection of fundamental 
human rights is especially necessary and involves a greater 
effort.</P>
