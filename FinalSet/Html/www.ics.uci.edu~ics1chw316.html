<LI><A NAME="QQ1"><H2>Who are the champions in wrestling?</H2></A>
Well, that would depend on what type of champions you're talking about.  
Pro wrestling is a pretty diverse &quot;sport&quot; (ha ha), and as a 
result, is 
infamous for having more champions than challengers.  Basically, there 
are two main federations nowadays.  The biggest (and most profitable) 
is the WWF, or the World Wrestling Federation.  The WWF has a history 
dating back to the 1960's where it has crowned several World Champions! 
You can even see a list of these 
<A HREF="http://www.luc.edu/~mlong/wwf.world.titles.html">monsters of 
mayhem!</A> Interestingly enough, the WWF has what it calls an 
&quot;Intercontinental Title&quot; as well.  This holder of this title 
has always served as the number one contender to the World Champ.  
There's also a comprehensive list of all the WWF's <A 
HREF="http://www.luc.edu/~mlong/wwf.interc.titles.html">Intercontinental 
Champs.</A>  The second most-profitable wrestling organization is the 
WCW, or World Championship Wrestling.  This one is owned by the world's 
&quot;most stable&quot; billionaire extraordinaire, Ted Turner.  Like the 
WWF, the WCW has a wide variety of champions.  However, the WCW saw its 
beginnings in the early part of the 20th Century.  You can see this long 
list of <A HREF="http://www.luc.edu/~mlong/nwawcw.world.titles.html">WCW 
World Champions.</a>  The list of <A 
HREF="http://www.luc.edu/~mlong/nwawcw.us.titles.html">United States 
Title Holders</a> (which is really the equivalent to the WWF 
Intercontinental Championship) can be found as well.

<p><LI><A NAME="QQ2"><H2>Who are on the legislative committees in the 
South Dakota state legislature?</H2></A> The answer to this question 
depends on what branch of the legislature you mean.  In South Dakota (as 
in most states), the legislature is bicameral.  This means there are two 
separate &quot;houses&quot;--the state senate and the state assembly.  Both 
houses have a number of special committees, which help fulfill their 
ultimate goal in getting legislation passed through the legislature. 
Such committees deal with South Dakota 
issues on both the state and local levels.  You can see a listing of the 
members, the political parties they belong to, and the committee names of 
either the South Dakota <A 
HREF="http://www.state.sd.us/state/legis/lrc/hscmtes.htm">House 
Standing Committees</A> or the South Dakota <A 
HREF="http://www.state.sd.us/state/legis/lrc/sscmtes.htm">Senate Standing 
Committees.</A>

<p><LI><A NAME="QQ3"><H2>What are the functions of the US State 
Department and Department of Health and Human Services?</H2></A> Let's start 
with the 
State Department.  Basically, the State Department is the &quot;eyes and 
ears&quot; of America's foreign policy.  Among other things, it sets out 
to establish relations with the rest of the world.  There are several 
areas which the State Department handles.  You can read more about these 
<A 
HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov/White_House/Cabinet/html/Department_of_State.html">State Department roles.</A>
The Department of Health and Human Services wants to keep all of America 
well.  In a nutshell, this wing of the Executive Branch is responsible 
for overseeing a wide variety of programs dealing with the health and 
well-being of all segments of America.  You can find out more about the

<p><LI><A NAME="QQ4"><H2>What is HTML, and how does it work?</H2></A>
HTML stands for &quot;Hyper Text Markup Language.&quot;  Simply put, HTML 
is a language by which one can go about creating documents to be viewed 
on a browser (such as Mosaic or Netscape). HTML helps make it possible 
for plain text to be "marked up".  As John December and Neil Randall say 
in "The World Wide Web Unleashed", the current version of HTML is 2.0.  
While this version allows more features (such as graphics), the two note 
that it still has a ways to go.  For instance, they say, HTML 2.0 is not 
yet equipped to do some specific, useful functions (such as desktop 
publishing).  The two also note that HTML allows for &quot;links&quot; to 
other sites on the web.  Thus, instead of being limited to a single web 
page, one can click on a link (if there is one on that page) and receive 
more information on the subject.  HTML, they say, has made this possible. 
There is much more information available on <A 
HREF="http://melmac.harris-atd.com/about_html.html">what HTML is.</a>  If 
you were interested in finding out ways of <A 
HREF="http://www.willamette.edu/html-composition/strict-html.html">programming in HTML</a>, you could do that as well. <p><A

<p><LI><A NAME="QQ5"><H2>What is new on Mosaic?</H2></A>
In order to tell you what's new on Mosaic, perhaps it's best to describe 
what Mosaic is.  Mosaic is a browser which allows a user to view a 
document/file in HTML format. Before Mosaic, information could only be 
presented in text form.  With Mosaic, however, someone can look at 
accompanying images.  Unfortunately, Mosaic is unable to display certain 
types of files currently (it needs the help of an add-on 
program) In addition, there are other limitations with Mosaic (one of 
which is its inability to incorporate other internet functions). Other 
than these limitations, Mosaic has proven to be a beneficial way of 
displaying information. The program operates 
on a few different terminal types.  For our purposes, we can see <A 
HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/XMosaic/d2-intro.html">how 
Mosaic operates on X terminals.</a>  Mosaic is also constantly updated.
