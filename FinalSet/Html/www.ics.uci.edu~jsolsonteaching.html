<p>I like to teach Human Centered Computing in a variety of forms.  I often like to give students the tools and the judgment necessary to use the tools well and in the right situations.</p>

<h2><a href="#" name="inf151">ICS:  Informatics 151  Project Management.</a></h2>
<p> I teach students how to plan a project in details including the component tasks, who will do each task, how long it will take, the dependencies among them and the costs and risks involved.  These are all part of standard project management training.  But in addition, I teach them how to manage people, to select people for a team, motivate them to do good work, give and receive feedback, etc.</p> 

<h2><a href="#" name="inf163">ICS:  Informatics 163  Project in Social Implications of Computing.</a></h2>
<p>  Students work in groups to identify the needs of an office, service, a team.  This year we experimented using Contextual Design, with students doing deep interviews of tasks, culture, resources, communication, etc. resulting in notes that are organized by theme, leading to recommendations.</p>

<h2><a href="#" name="inf191a">ICS:  Informatics 191A  Senior Design Project.</a></h2>
<p>Students in Informatics are required to cap their undergraduate experience with a 3-quarter design project.  I am co-teaching this with Hadar Ziv, who has taught this course for a number of years.  It is my role this year to infuse the course with more usability engineering in the software design process, including interviewing potential users, developing personals and scenarios leading to use cases, etc. </p>
