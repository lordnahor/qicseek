<font FACE="Times New Roman">
<p ALIGN="LEFT">The idea of Ubiquitous Computing (<i>ubicomp</i>) has been 
challenging the dominant desktop computing paradigm in many ways. In a world 
where several small computing devices communicate with each other and with 
humans in a context-aware manner, the need for short-range, localized 
communications emerges as a critical issue. Devices that are nearby must take 
advantage of the proximity, rather than overloading the links for long-distance 
communication. Short-range communication cannot be properly addressed by simply 
scaling down the existing communication networks. Efforts such as IrDA and 
Bluetooth attest to that. We argue that sound will also play an important role 
in this new computing world.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">This article revisits acoustic modems in the context of <i>
ubicomp </i>applications. In particular, it focuses on modems specifically 
designed for short-range, low bandwidth communications in air. The objectives of 
the article are three-fold. First, we identify a class of applications within 
the <i>ubicomp </i>paradigm that greatly benefit from such communication system, 
and identify human factors that the design of these modems must account for. 
Second, we show how standard modulation techniques can be used to produce 
communication systems that account for those human factors, <i>i.e.</i>, in 
which the messages are musical and other familiar sounds. Finally, we 
demonstrate the feasibility of our aerial acoustic modems with illustrative 
examples.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">This work lays out the ground work for an interdisciplinary 
collaboration seldom seen in the desktop world: one where communications 
engineers and sound artists will work together. The modems described here are 
only a hint of what can come next.</p>
