    <h3>Variance and Standard Deviation of the Sample Mean: Exponential
      Data<br>
    </h3>
    We know from Theorem 6.2.3 that the variance of the sample mean is
    the variance of the population divided by the sample size. The
    variance of an Exponential distribution with rate parameter 4 is
    1/(4<sup>2</sup>) = 0.0625. Thus, the variance of the sample mean
    for a sample size of 10,000 is 0.0625/10000 = 6.25 x 10<sup>-6</sup>,
    and the standard deviation is<br>
    <pre>&gt; sqrt(.0625/10000)</pre>
    <pre>[1] 0.0025</pre>
