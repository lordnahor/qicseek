		<description><![CDATA[Hah!  I prescribe a daily glass of red wine, a game of chess, and 30 minutes bowling.  Won&#039;t affect the impatience quotient in the slightest, but impatience isn&#039;t the problem here, is it.

		<description><![CDATA[Where do you think the saying &quot;grumpy old man&quot; comes from?  I think it&#039;s definitely part of aging-you don&#039;t feel the need to be nice and polite all the time.  I knew you were becoming a grumpy old man!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think it&#039;s a symptom of the culture we live in today - advances in technology mean that we no longer have to wait for things we once did. I think in many ways it&#039;s a shame, but I too find myself getting agitated if a process takes longer than usual, whether that&#039;s loading a web page or a train running later than scheduled. I&#039;m not sure that things will improve in the near future either.]]></description>
