<li><A Name="Question1"><H2>What is the World Wide Web?</H2></A>
<br>
In March of 1989, Tim Berners-Lee stated in his proposal,<a 
href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">
<I>WorldWideWeb: Proposal for a Hypertext Project<I></a>,<&quot>a way 
which
 allows a user to follow links pointing from one piece of information to 
 another one.<&quot> These hypertext links were originally developed by
 Geneva's European Particle Physics Laboratory, or <a 
href="http://www1.cern.ch/">CERN</a>,
 as an easier way for researchers to share their information. It took 
over
 a year to get off the ground, but the World Wide Web has expanded many
 times over since 1993.

<br>
<li><A Name="Question2"><H2>Is there a way to discuss upcoming 
performances and other relevant info about theatre and film on the 
Internet?</H2></a>
<br>
Although one would think at first that drama has little to do with
 computing, there are indeed many places on the Web where one can 
discuss
 all aspects of theatre. For example, <a 
href="http://www.mit.edu:8001/people/quijote/theatre-central.html">
<I>The Theatre Central Web Page<I></a> contains links to many other 
theatre
 pages all around the world. As for information about upcoming events 
and
 exciting new techniques in the theatre industry, much can be discovered
 within the various <a href="http:www.mit.edu:8001/people/quijote/news">
 drama newsgroups</a> which can be found on the Internet.

<br>
<li><A Name="Question3"><H2>Where can I begin my search for information 
within the World Wide Web?</H2></A>
<br>
At over one million computers and growing, the Internet is the world's
 largest computer newtwork. Sifting through, and finding information on 
the
 World Wide Web can be overwhelming, to say the least.  There are many
 places to start on a search for Web information, but I have found two
 particularly helpful ones to begin with. The first is called the <a 
href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/home/mcbryan/WWWW.html">
 <I>World Wide Web Worm<I></a>. The Worm is located on the WWW server of 
the University 
 of Colorado homepage. Its function is to search throughout the Web for 
home
 pages. The user enters in one or more keywords and the Worm takes over.
 Another great place to start searching is the <a 
href="http://galaxy.einet.net/galaxy.html>
<I>EINET Galaxy Index<I></a>. The Index contains information organized 
by
 topic. This is a much easier, but less specific searcher than the Worm.

<BR>
<li><A Name="Question4"><H2>What tools can I use to search for 
information on the Internet?</H2></A>
<br>
There are two main tools to guide a user through the Internet: Gopher 
and
 the World Wide Web. Gopher provides a menu listing of subjects. When 
one
 selects an item on a Gopher menu, another menu of related items is, 
 in turn, displayed.  This proceedure is repeated until the user finds 
the
 information he/she is looking for. The World Wide Web gives the user a 
 graphical interface from which to make their selections, making it a 
more
 user-friendly environment.      
<br>
Search <a 
href="http://galaxy.einet.net/gopher/gopher.html><i>Gopher<i></a>
here.
<br>
Search the <a href="http://galaxy.einet.net/www/www.html><i>World Wide 
Web<i></a>
here.

<li><A Name="Question3"><H2>How can the World Wide Web benefit me as a 
drama major?</h2></A>
<br>
The World Wide Web has much to offer a drama student, whether it be 
through
 the online magazine <a 
href="http://www.webcom.com/~broadway/welcome.html">
<I>Broadway World Wide<I></a>, or <a 
href="http://www.ee.pdx.edu:80/depts/fpa/">
<i>Portland State University's<i> academic program. <I>Broadway World 
Wide<I>
 offers theatre listings  for both Broadway and off-Broadway shows, a 
help
 wanted link which displays jobs currently available in the New York 
theatre
 community, and also up to date news about the world of the stage.  All 
of
 these things benefit me by keeping me abreast of what is going on 
inside
 and outside of the university setting, enabling me to establish 
contacts
 for my future career in theatre.  Portland University's site gives a 
guided
 tour through the college and its theatre program, including some facts 
 
 about the state of Oregon. This is very helpful, as I am planning on 
moving
 there in the near future.
