<h2>Partnerships and Related Efforts</h2>

<h3>Expanding Computing Education Pathways</h3>
<p>ACCESS participates in a national collaboration, <a href="http://expandingcomputing.cs.umass.edu" target="_blank">Expanding Computing Education Pathways</a> (<a href="http://expandingcomputing.cs.umass.edu" target="_blank">ECEP</a>), a Broadening Participation in Computing Alliance funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), whose primary goal is to increase the number and diversity of students in the pipeline to computing and computing-intensive degrees. ACCESS joins the Commonwealth Alliance for Information Technology Education (CAITE) in Massachusetts, Georgia Computes! and South Carolina to share strategies and best practices to expand quality computing education pathways in California. </p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Code.org</h3>
<p></p>
<p>
<a href="http://code.org" target="_blank">Code.org</a> is a non-profit dedicated to growing computer science education by making it available in more schools, and increasing participation by women and underrepresented students of color. Code.org's vision is that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer programming and that computer science should be part of the core curriculum in education, alongside other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses. To this end, Code.org advocates and lobbys for CS as a college preparatory, core credit (Math or Science) at the state and district levels.  ACCESS collaborates with Code.org on this advocacy throughout California.</p>

<h3>Computer Science Teachers Association</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.csta.acm.org" target="_blank">Computer Science Teachers Association</a> (<a href="http://www.csta.acm.org" target="_blank">CSTA</a>) is a membership organization that supports and promotes the teaching of computer science and other computing disciplines. CSTA provides opportunities for Kâ€“12 teachers and students to better understand the computing disciplines and to more successfully prepare themselves to teach and learn. CSTA has been supporting ACCESS since its inception, in exploring and informing issues in credentialing and professional development for computer science teachers in California.</p>
<h3>Computing in the Core</h3>
<p></p>
<p><a href="http://www.computinginthecore.org" target="_blank">Computing in the Core</a> (<a href="http://www.computinginthecore.org" target="_blank">CinC</a>) is a non-partisan advocacy coalition of associations, corporations, scientific societies, and other non-profits to elevate computer science education to a core academic subject in K-12 education, giving young people the college- and career-readiness knowledge and skills necessary in a technology-focused society. CinC encourages awareness building activities, policy changes and research at national, state, and local levels to build a strong foundation for the future of computer science instruction. It will engage federal and state policy makers, educators, the public, and the media to meet these goals. ACCESS works with Computing in the Core in advocating for policy changes with respect to computer science education in California.</p>
<h3>Exploring Computer Science</h3>
<p></p>
 <p><a href="http://www.exploringcs.org" target="_blank">Exploring Computer Science</a> (<a href="http://www.exploringcs.org" target="_blank">ECS</a>) is a K-12/University partnership committed to democratizing computer science by creating a model curriculum, professional development for teachers and a repository of best practices that can be scaled up nationwide.  ECS was developed in California via a partnership with UCLA, the Computer Science Teachers Association, and the National Science Foundation.  ECS is currently being taught in high schools in Los Angeles and Silicon Valley, as well as schools in major urban cities throughout the nation.</p>
<h3>Computer Science: Principles</h3>
 <p><a href="http://www.csprinciples.org" target="_blank">Computer Science: Principles</a> is a new rigorous college-preparatory AP course under development, which intends to foster wider appeal for computing, simultaneously seeking to broaden participation in the computer science discipline and to better prepare a pipeline of STEM majors. Development is being led by a team of computer science educators organized by the College Board and the National Science Foundation. Within California, CS:Principles has been piloted at UC Berkeley and UC San Diego and is offered at more than 30 high schools throughout the state.</p>
