				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Along with Sara Hendren (Harvard), Geof will be a speaker in the PROGRAM series at NYU organized by the departments of <a href="http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/mcc/">Media, Culture and Communication</a>, <a href="http://english.fas.nyu.edu/page/home">English</a>, and <a href="http://complit.as.nyu.edu/page/home">Comparative Literature</a>. More event details can be found <a href="http://www.programseries.com/events/values-in-technological-design/">here</a>. </p>
<p><strong><em>Values in Technological Design</em></strong><br />
Abstract:<br />
The goal for many designers of technology is to produce objects that are useful, but whose use is not dictated by the object design itself. Computers in particular are flexible technologies, and can be programmed to suit a wide variety of functions and needs. Yet despite these goals of technological neutrality, the design of technical objects often shapes their use, and can have far-reaching political, social, and cultural consequences. This event investigates the ways in which values become embodied in technological design and what efforts we might make to address such structures.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Geof will be speaking as part of the <a href="http://www.si.umich.edu/newsandevents/event/yahoo-lecture-series-geoffrey-bowker">Yahoo! Lecture Series</a> at the <a href="http://www.si.umich.edu/">University of Michigan&#8217;s School of Information</a> on April 10, 2013. </p>
<p><strong><em>The End of the Article</em></strong><br />
Abstract:<br />
In this talk, I analyze the development of the scientific article as the coin of the realm for the transmission of knowledge.  I argue that the database, over the past 200 years, has grown into a form of transmission and exploration which has been largely under-recognized.  I then discuss examples of new forms of knowledge expression which both deploy databases more effectively and move from a largely logocentric model to one engaging a wider set of senses.  Finally, I explore the possibilities for developing these new forms within the academy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While Facebook is an active, fast-paced site of social engagement for roughly one billion people, it also constitutes a staggering archive – the database of all posts, pictures, likes, friendships and associations, and interactions. The interface design of Facebook gives but a small peek into the workings of the complex databases beneath, and the lives they reference; however, the exponentially growing archive underneath is approaching a new scale of encyclopedic social knowledge.</p>
<p>The FB project presents a kaleidoscopic view of Facebook’s representations and underlying databases drawing upon Jacques Derrida, John Bender, Sigmund Freud, and Denis Diderot. The provocation is designed to engage users with notions of spectrality, domesticity, inscription, temporality, and violence, each existing on a flexible plane at the heart of Derrida’s “Archive Fever.” These Derridian Facebook imaginaries are presented through an interactive digital diagram inspired by plates found in the encyclopedia of Diderot and the recent analytical work of John Bender.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The research project Knowledge Infrastructure Policy: From Shrinking Cities to Sustainable Cities revolves around a STEM collaboration with teenaged students from Orange County high schools. Bringing together STEM learning and participatory design, the project has a sharp focus on the reclamation of urban space as a community activity. The goal is not only to learn how to use. Design thinking – re-thinking complex social problems – can open onto STEM engagement through creative modeling that enables analytic diagnosis for design ideation, concept generation and prototyping solutions that become pilot projects in school and community contexts. Throughout this project, we will teach ‘design thinking’ (eco-system, contextual user research, systems analysis, design strategy and planning), informatics, and data analysis towards the question: How can we expand access to resources for students and teachers to learn 21rst Century computer science, informatics, technology and design sciences for knowledge infrastructure policy leadership?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This project will enliven everyday life on campus. As with many campuses, the design of public space at UCI has been motivated by values of efficiency (getting cars parked, getting students to classes) and security (keeping it safe) and are seen by many as “sociofugal” &#8211;unfriendly and uninspiring &#8212; spaces.  Our challenge is to take such a ‘dead’ space (a parking garage, unused open space) on campus and develop a redesign based around the values of hesitation and presence.  By hesitation and presence, we mean creating spaces where people will stop, become aware of the area and people around themselves, and engage in meditation or reflection in ways that take them outside of the constant drive to get to the next class or meeting &#8212; thereby both permitting and encouraging enriched relationships with their physical environments. To get there, we will use ideas and principles from the fields of design, architecture, social ecology and computer science.</p>

<p>Take part in an intensive one-week workshop on values in the design of information systems and technology. Doctoral students at any stage from a variety of disciplines are invited to attend, including – but not restricted to – informatics, computer science, science and technology studies, design, social computing, visual arts and social entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>The workshop will be restricted to twenty (20) students. The program will include a broad mix of readings and exercises from the fields above. Students will work in interdisciplinary groups to design and prototype a pilot project incorporating social values at the center of information systems and technology.</p>
<p>The workshop will feature guest lectures from thought leaders in the design, STS, HCI and maker/DIY communities throughout the week. The workshop will culminate in project presentations to a panel of scholars, designers and entrepreneurs. We will offer support for ideas that continue on to working prototypes, sustainable collaborations and project launch.</p>
<p>To apply, please send a current CV, a 1000-word statement of your research interest in the VID program and a letter of recommendation.</p>
<p>Details from last summer&#8217;s workshop, including project descriptions, can be found <a href="http://evoke.ics.uci.edu/values-in-design/">here</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Applications are due by April 15, 2013 at <a href="mailto:vid2013@ics.uci.edu">vid2013@ics.uci.edu</a></strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We host an annual workshop which brings together graduate students and faculty from a wide-ranging array of fields with the purpose of creating a shared theoretical basis and practice for values-centered design.The Values in Design Doctoral Workshop is a week-long, intensive event sponsored by the Values in Design Program through the Department of Informatics in the Donald Bren School of Information &amp; Computer Sciences at University of California, Irvine.</p>
<p>We bring together a group of exceptional doctoral students from a wide range of backgrounds to study and address issues of how human and social values are embedded, built into, influence, and otherwise instantiate themselves in information systems and technologies. By working across the intersections of computer science and engineering, social studies of science and technology, anthropology, policy and law, business, social entrepreneurship, art, design, and information science, the group delves into the theories contributing to (and arising out of) sociotechnical design, in addition to spending the week designing and building original information systems and technologies that materialize a set of social values.</p>
<p>If you would like to know more about the workshop, or more generally about the work being done in the Values in Design Program, please send an email to vid@ics.uci.edu.</p>
