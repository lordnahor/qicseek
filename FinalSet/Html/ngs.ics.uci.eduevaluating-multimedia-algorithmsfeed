		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ramesh,
 I noticed that you also do a fair amount reasearch in the computer vision space.  My company places engineers/scientists with R&amp;D/DOD clients.    I have a research client in need of a 2009 PHD grad with a background in object tracking/recogntion, activity tracking and machine learning.  Job is located in the Northeast.  if you have any students who may be interested they can contact me at 603-898-8777 or jt@slidebrook.com(  PS  I&#039;m redoing my website and it&#039;s really &quot;under construction&quot;)

Thank You!!
