<h3 align=center><font size=+1><b>Catalina</b></font></h3>
<p>
Catalina is the most optimum fishing spot as far as variety compared to cost,
compared distance from port.  Catalina is good for perch, bonito, rockfish,
bass, barracudas, and sharks.  Party boat trip prices for the full day run
about $37 or $40 with a pole rental.  The three-quarter day Catalina trip
goes for about $27, $30 with a pole rental.</p>

<h3 align=center><font size=+1><b>San Clemente</b></font></h3>
<p>
San Clemente is offered only in day and a half trips, because of its distance
from port, better than twice that of Catalina.  You catch most of the same
fish as catalina, with the addition of the more tropical fish, occasional
yellowfin tuna, and yellowtail.  These trips go to about $52 or $59 with rod
rental.</p>

<h3 align=center><font size=+1><b>14 Mile Bank</b></font></h3>

<P>
The 14 Mile bank is basically our one-half to three-quarter day trip.  By far
the most economical trip, the fishing isn't bad, roughly the same variety as
Catalina, except you may get overcrowding problems.  Priced at $19 or $25
with rod rental.</p>
