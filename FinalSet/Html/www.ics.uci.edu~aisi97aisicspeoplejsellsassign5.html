<P><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Navajo are the largest
Indian tribe in the United States. They live on the largest reservation
in the U.S. which covers over three states on 17 million acres in the Four
Corners area of the southwest. The states include Arizona, New Mexico,
Utah and a small part of Colorado. The current population is at least 160,000
and projected to grow to a quarter of a million by the year 2000. Growth
in commerce on the reservation promises to make the Navajo one of the wealthiest
tribes in the country, but it does not seem that way. Like the other 
Athapascan-speaking people in the southwest, the Apaches, they arrived 
later than most tribes in the region. Archaeological evidence indicates that 
the Navajos migrated from the north about A.D. 1025 and the earliest Apache 
bands arrived about A.D. 825.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Spanish began calling
the Navajos by the name Apache de Navajo to distinguish them from the Apaches.
The word Navajo, or Navaho (pronounced NAH-vuh-ho), is not Athapascan however,
it is a Pueblo Indian word of a stretch of land in the Southwest. In their
own tongue they identify themselves as the Dine, or &quot;the people&quot;
and call their homeland Dinetah. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Navajos reside in
shelters called hogans. Their hogans were shaped as conicals and later
into hexagons and octagons. They used logs and poles for the framework
and built the walls of earth and bark, and eventually, into stone and adobe.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Navajos acquired
sheep and goats from the Spaniards. Unlike the Apache they did not consume
all of their meat supply. In contrast, they allowed their flocks to increase,
which they kept for a meat, milk, and wool source. Therefore, animal husbandry,
especially sheepherding became an economic resource to the Navajo. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Apache and Navajo
were feared by Indian, Spanish, Mexican, and American inhabitants of the
region. They earned their vicious reputation from the time they first arrived
in the Southwest by launching raids on the agricultural Pueblo Indians
for food, property, women, and slaves. Gradually through contact with the
native tribes of the area they began to adopt new cultural traits. They
learned to farm, weave and sand paint, as well as mold pottery and new
basket weaving techniques. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode"><FONT SIZE=-1>Art and religion, for
the Navajos, as for all Indians, are intimately related. Art served as
a bridge between the natural and supernatural worlds and a way to relate
to spirit beings. It was also a medium to contact their ancestors and influence
the spirits to bring good weather or cure the ill.</FONT></FONT></P>

&amp; BIOLOGY OF THE NAVAJO NATION</FONT></FONT></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode">The Navajo Nation
is located on the Colorado Plateau and covers over 25,000 square miles
in northeast Arizona, northwest New Mexico, and southeast Utah. It is bordered
by two major rivers-the Colorado on the west and the San Juan on the north.
Other major geographic features within its borders include the Little Colorado
River, Navajo Mountain, Rainbow Bridge, Black Mesa, Monument Valley, Canyon
de Chelly, Chuska Mountains, Carrizo Mountains, and Ship Rock. Elevations
range from 10,388 feet to 2,722 feet, and biotic communities range from
subalpine conifer forests to desert scrub. Thirteen federally endangered,
threatened or proposed species reside on the Navajo Nation. Six species
or subspecies of plants and animals are found only on the Navajo Nation.</FONT></FONT></P>
