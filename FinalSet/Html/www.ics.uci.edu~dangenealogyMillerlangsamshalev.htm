Dear Moishe,


I came across Suzan Wynne through another branch of family. Regarding other
Langsams in Israel, interestingly enough the head of Yad Vashem, Avner
Shalev, is really a Langsam. You will note that Shalev is the Hebraicized
translation of the name Langsam. I don't think, however, that he is into
the family tree thing.


Best regards,


Dov Rubin

Good morning,
As promised, I talked to Avner Shalev about your web site. He is very
interested in your work, but says that due to his heavy workload at Yad
Vashem, he neglected dealing with his own family history. He will do his
best to find some time to answer you in detail. Meanwhile he wishes you all
the best and congratulates you on the work you have done so far. 
Best regards, 
Irena Steinfeldt

Dear Director, 

Thank you for your warm words and kind support. Perhaps you can
assist me in a somewhat selfish request. Dr. Avner Shalav is a
LANGSAM descendant, that was his family name. I have contacted 
him and his secretary (Irena Steinfeldt) countless times, but can
not seem to get any information. Does Dr. Shalav have any siblings
or relatives I can speak to instead? I do not need to find this out
from him. Like Yad >Vashem, I have the desire to perpetuate my
family, especially those that perished in the Holocaust. I can not
understand why someone in his position would not share a similar
attitude. As someone devoted to commemorating our heritage, perhaps
you can prevail upon him to answer three short questions: 
  * father's name 
  * his grandfather's name 
  * what city his grandfather was from  

Thanks again, 
Moishe Miller
