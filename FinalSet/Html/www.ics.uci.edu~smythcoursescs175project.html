<h3>Instructions for Final Project Reports</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Please submit your final project report to EEE, plus supporting
code</li>
  <li> Reports should be a minimum of 5 pages and a maximum of 10 pages
in length in Word or PDF format, called<span style="font-weight: bold;">
finalreport.doc </span>or <span style="font-weight: bold;">finalreport.pdf</span>.</li>
  <li>Please also upload all of the code you developed for
the final project (as a Zip file called <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">code.zip</span>), including a <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">README</span> file that briefly explains
the functionality of each function that you wrote or use. Your code
should be clearly documented, to the extent that
someone
such as the TA or a professor can understand from the documentation how
to run your code, e.g., what types of input images to provide, what
output
to expect, etc. Include any MATLAB functions are not part of the basic
MATLAB toolbox, but that are called by your project functions, e.g.,
function
modules that you developed for earlier assignments.</li>
  <li>Your code should also include a single MATLAB file called <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">demoscript.m </span>that provides an
example of how your code runs, e.g., reads in a test image, extracts
features in real-time, and uses a classification model or face
detection algorithm, etc) that was already learned by your algorithm
"offline" to classify or process this test image, and then displays the
results. IMPORTANT: <br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>your script should run without requiring any input - so define
some variables at the top of the script that define your classifier
(e.g., stored in a .mat file to be read in) and your test data. <br>
    </li>
    <li>Also, your demo_script should not take any longer than 1 minute
to run!</li>
  </ul>
  <li>If you are using the "default" data sets, you do not need to
upload any data. If you are using a non-standard data set, please
upload your data (in MATLAB format if possible) in an additional Zip
file called <span style="font-weight: bold;">data.zip</span>.&nbsp; If
youe data file is too large to upload, please make the data available
somewhere on a Web page and upload a text file called "<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">README_data</span>" that points to the
location of the data.</li>
  <li>The total size of whatever you upload in total (after compression with Zip) can be as large as 50Mbytes (but no larger). </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4><font size="+1">What your Project Report must contain:</font></h4>
Your proposal must contain the following sections.<br>
<ol>
  <li><b>Task Description</b>: A brief description of the specific
classification
or recognition task you addressed.<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Data Sets:&nbsp;</span> A brief
description of what data sets you used in your project. Clearly
indicate number of images, resolution, and any other relevant aspects.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Feature Calculation:</b> The specific image representation
(features)
you investigated for solving this problem, e.g., provide descriptions
of
how the features were calculated (if its complicated, you can put
pseudocode
in an Appendix, for example) and provide examples (e.g., sample images,
graphs, etc) if possible.. It should be clear from your description how
your features are defined and how they were used for in classification
(e.g., if you use templates as features, be very clear on how the
template
results are used as features for classification).</li>
  <li><b>Classification Algorithms</b>: Describe briefly the
classification
algorithms you used, and in particular any settings that you used
(e.g.,
how was k chosen for kNN?) or any modifications you made to the basic
algorithm.</li>
  <li><b>Experimental&nbsp; Setup:</b> A description of how your
experiments
were conducted. Clearly describe how you ran your experiments so that a
reader could repeat the general method you used if they wanted to..<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Experimental Results: </b>Tables, graphs, figures, that
present your
experimental results. Again there should be enough detail here that a
reader
can evaluate your project, but avoid having pages and pages of numbers,
i.e., the reader should be able to easily see your main results. <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Assessment and Evaluation: </b>Provide a discussion
on your
evaluation and assessment of the results, e.g., having completed the
project
do you think the task was difficult or easy for a computer algorithm to
try to solve? what were the limitations of your approach? what were the
successes? how might you build a better system if you had more time?
what
aspects of the data set limited your results? And so forth. Be honest
in
your assessment of your results, e.g., if your accuracies were low you
should honestly and objectively discuss why the accuracy may be low.
Similarly
if the accuracy is high, you should explain why if possible. You can
full
points if you write a well-written comprehensive report, even if your
results
are not very accurate: conversely you will get a low score if you write
a poor report, even if you have very accurate results.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Appendix: Software.</span>&nbsp;
List the main MATLAB functions (plus code in any other languages) that
you wrote for the project. Clearly indicate whether each function is
either</li>
  <ul>
    <li>written entirely from "scratch" by you for the project</li>
    <li>a modified version of a function you wrote earlier for an
assignment</li>
    <li>a copy of a function provided by the instructor (or a modified
version of the instructor's code)</li>
    <li>code obtained from the Web or some other similar source.</li>
  </ul>
</ol>
<br>
<h3>Grading of the Final Report<br>
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The final project report is worth 35% of
your
total grade. So please
make
sure to allow enough time to write a good final project report!&nbsp;
You should write this with a general reader in mind, e.g., another
computer scientist who did not take this class - so the report should
be fully self-contained and clearly explain where the data came from,
what functions you used (whether you wrote them or someone else) and so
forth.</li>
  <li>Reports will be graded on</li>
  <ul>
    <li>clear writing style: is the report clear and easy to follow?</li>
    <li>is the report systematic and thorough?<br>
    </li>
    <li>use of figures, graphs, tables, etc, to illustrate the results.
Feel free to use color in your figures if it helps explain or clarify a
particular point.<br>
    </li>
    <li>technical correctness - e.g., is it clear that you understand
the techniques you are using, and are you able to draw appropriate
conclusions from your results.<br>
    </li>
    <li>degree of difficulty of the project attempted</li>
    <li>Note: it is most important that you write a clear report and
document objectively what methods you implemented and
the experimental results you obtained. How well the method worked is
not nearly as important as clearly documenting what you did and what
you learned from your project.<br>
    </li>
