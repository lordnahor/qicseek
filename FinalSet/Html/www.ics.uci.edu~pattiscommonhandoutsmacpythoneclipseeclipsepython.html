<b>Install Python before installing Eclipse.</b>
<p>
You may want to print these instructions before proceeding, so that you can
 refer to them while downloading and installing Eclipse.
Or, just keep this document in your browser.
You should read each step completely before performing the action that it
 describes.
This document shows downloading and installing Eclipse on Mac OS X in Fall 2013.
<p>

<h2>Eclipse: Version 4.3 (Kepler)</h2>
<p>

The Eclipse download requires about 196 MB of disk space; keep it on your
 machine, in case you need to re-install Eclipse.
When installed, Eclipse requires about an additional 200 MB of disk space.
<p>

<h3>Downloading</h3>
<ol>
<li>Click
   <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/index.php" target="_blank">Eclipse</a><p>
   You following page will appear in your browser.
   In this handout we will download <b>Eclipse Standard 4.3</b> for
     Mac OS X; if the text next to the "green arrows" does not say Mac OS X, then
       look above the column of "green arrows" for the label
       <b>Eclipse Standard (4.3) Packages for</b>
       and in the pull-down list to its right, choose
       <b>Mac OS X (Cocoa)</b> and then continue below.
   <p>
   <img src="images/eclipse/mac/eclipsedownloadpage.png">
   <p>

<p>
<li>Click the <b>32 Bit</b> Operating System for your machine
     (even if you know your Operating System is 64 Bits and even if you
     downloaded the 64 Bit version of Python), under the heading
     <b>Eclipse Standard 4.3</b> (the first icon from the top).
   <p>
   You will see the following page (don't worry about the name of the
     institution to the right of the big downward pointing arrow).
   <p>
   <img src="images/eclipse/mac/mirror.png">   

<p>
<li>Click the big downward pointing arrow underneath the
     <b>Download eclipse-standard-kepler-R-macosx-cocoa.tar.gz from:</b>
   The site named here, in purple to the right of the arrow:
     <b>[United States] The Pennsylvania State University (http)</b> is the
     random one chosen by the download page this time.
   <p>
   This file should start downloading in your standard download folder.
   This file is about 196 MB so it might take a while to download fully if you
     are on a slow internet connection (it took me about 6 minutes over a
     cable modem).
   Don't worry about the exact time as long as the download continues to make
     steady progress.
   <p>
   The file should appear as
   <p>
   <img src="images/eclipse/mac/downloadfile.png">
   <p>
   Terminate the window browsing the Eclipse download.

<p>
<li>Move this file to a more permanent location, so that you can install Eclipse
     (and reinstall it later, if necessary).
<p>
<li>Start the <b>Installing</b> instructions directly below.
</ol>

<p>

<h3>Installing (for Python)</h3>

<b>Python should be installed before installing Eclipse</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Unzip <b>eclipse-standard-kepler-R-macosx-cocoa.tar.gz</b>, the file that you just
    downloaded and moved.
   <br>
   To do this just Double-Click on the file.
   </ul>
   <p>
   Unzipping this file creates a folder named <b>eclipse</b> (located in the same directory as the tar.gz file by default).
   <p>
   You can leave this folder here or move it elsewhere on your hard disk.
   I recommend putting the downloaded file and resulting folder in the
      <b>Applications</b> folder.

<p>
<li>Create a shortcut on your dock (where all of the shortcuts to your applications are) to the <b>Eclipse</b> file in
     this <b>eclipse</b> folder: <img src="images/eclipse/eclipseapp.png">
   <br>
   On most Mac computers, you can
   <ul>
   <li>Click and hold the file <b>eclipse</b>
   <li>Drag it to the dock.
   <li>Release the mouse button.
   </ul>
   <p>
   Now you are ready to perform a <b>one-time only</b> setup of Eclipse on
     your machine.

<p>
<li>Click the shortcut to Eclipse that you just created above.
   <p>
   The following splash screen will appear
   <p>
   <img src="images/eclipse/mac/splash.png">
   <p>
   and then a <b>Workspace Launcher</b> pop-up window will appear.
   <p>
   <img src="images/eclipse/mac/workspacelauncher.png">
   <p>
   In the <b>Workspace</b> text box, your login name should appear between
     <b>/Users/</b> and <b>/Documents/workspace</b>, instead of <b>Mike</b>.
   <p>
   Leave <b>unchecked</b> the 
     <b>Use this as the default and do not ask again</b> box.
   Although you will use this same workspace for the entire quarter (checking
     projects in and out of it), it is best to see this
     <b>Workspace Launcher</b> pop-up window each time you start Eclipse, to
     remind you where your workspace is located.

<li>Click <b>OK</b>.
   <p>
   Progress bars will appear as Eclipse loads.
   <p>
   Eventually the Eclipse workbench will appear with a <b>Welcome</b> tab
     covering it.
   <p>
   <img src="images/eclipse/mac/welcome.png">

     first time.

      module files (ending in <b>.py</b>).

      module files into this <b>courselib</b> folder; these modules will be
