  <ul>
    <li>Goals: The  purpose of this assignment is:
      <ul>
        <li>to interpret your evaluation fair data</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Instructions
      <ul>
        <li>This is a group project, submit information as a group        </li>
      
      <li>Turn in a report on paper to my office ICS 214 by Tuesday June 13th at 10am (this is the final exam slot for our class). Forget the electronic drop box. </li>
      <li>The report should contain
        <ul>
          <li>Your original hand drawn proposals juxtaposed against the final website and mobile design (if applicable)
            <ul>
              <li>I would like an analysis of why there are differences between the two. That may include: </li>
              <li>What differences are the result of technological limitations both in the fundamental technology and in your knowledge of how to implement it ? </li>
              <li>What differences are the result of design choices made after the hand-drawn proposal?</li>
              <li>What other reasons/ rationale caused a difference?</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>A presentation of the results collected in the evaluation fair
            <ul>
              <li>Each test that you performed coupled with the results of the test presented in a way that effectively communicates what you discovered. (graph, selected comments, table, etc.)</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>An interpretation of the results from the evaluation fair
            <ul>
              <li>Why did you get the results you did? Are they surprising? Are they useful? </li>
              <li>Would you pick different evaluation metrics in the future? What would they be? </li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>A proposed way forward
            <ul>
              <li>Given your results and your interpretation, what is an appropriate design response to the website that you have created?</li>
              <li>How would you change the interaction patterns?</li>
              <li>How would you change the functionality?</li>
              <li>What usage patterns would you choose to abandon and what new patterns would you choose to support?</li>
              <li>Would you add new pages to the interaction? Would you add new features? Which ones    ?</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>A technology laundry list
            <ul>
              <li>What technologies, languages, libraries,  techniques and software did you use to implement your design?</li>
              <li>Where can one find more information on those technologies?</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>A URL
            <ul>
              <li>A url where your application can be found. Once the admin is finished, I am going to publish a list of the projects that were done in this class and hopefully get a small press release out. If you want to be linked into this endeavor, give me one website URL that you want me to publish your work under. If you have a mobile phone component you should add a link to that software on your website. You may also want to include a link to your C.V.</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Depending on how you format your report, something that is 5 - 10 pages of double-space text plus additional pages for images is the target length. Competent analysis is more important than length. </li>
      </ul></li>
  </ul>
