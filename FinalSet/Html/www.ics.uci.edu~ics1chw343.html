Three neat Web finds:
<ol>
<li><P>
With the Web one can find information about a specific country without 
having to stress.  If you are 
planning to travel or just inquire about a country the Virtual Tourist 
(by Brandon Plewe) is the place to 
visit.   It serves as a visual interface into the geographic distribution 
of the WWW servers.  It gathers 
tourism, geographical and cultural information about a specific region.  
All you have to do is click on a 
symbol or boxed region within the Mosaic page.  <A 
href="http://wings.buffalo.edu/world"><b>click here to 
view!</b></A> the available page.</P>

<li><P>
Traveling trough the world may be to exhausting for some.  Maybe a more 
specific search is needed.  The 
Web is the place to do it.  The Yellow pages may sometimes lack the 
specific information we need about a 
particualr business.  The list of Comercial Services on the Web and (Net) 
is available with lots of more  
detail.  On this page dozzens of links to businesses, business service 
and nonprofit organizations are 
availabel.  Take a look to see what you can find.  <A 
href="http://www.directory.net"><b>click here!</b></A></p>
<p>Here you can browse through the businesses you are 
interested in, get detail information and even order.  For example, when 
click on the above, the page asks 
you to enter a search, you could enter the word flower and a list of 
florist will appear you may choose 
one or several and even  order what you like.</P>
 <li><P>Businesses still have lot's of improvements comming up.  There is 
a lot to look forward in the future.  
For example in the future we may be able to do our banking in our home 
computer.  Bank of America has a 
home page that promises lot's of potential.  All your transactions can be 
taken care of by clicking a few 
icons.  Imagine no more waiting in line or dealing with tellers who are 
slow and don't know much. View <A 
href="http://www.bankamerica.com".<b>Bank of America!</b></A>
<P>
We may be able to have it all.  Now we can travel form our computers and 
learn about the different 
countries and specific reagions without spending money.  In the future we 
may be able to do it all.  From 
our  banking need to shopping for groceries.  Computers will become as 
necessary as a car.

<LI><A NAME="QQ1"><B>What is the importance of the World Wide Web?</B></A>
<P>Before this class I had no idea the web existed.  Now I realize how much 
time I could have saved if I had known about it before.  You can do 
research and get lots of updated information in less time than doing 
library research.  But is not just beneficial for students, the web is 
fun for any user since you can explore items world wide.  Most of the 
browsers are easy to use.  A popular one is Mosaic, since it includes 
graphics is fun to work with.  If one is interested in animal then you could 
access this <A 
href="http://www.umanitoba.ca/arrs/index.html"><b> 
article </b> </A>.  This particular example is found in the Animal Rights Resource Site 
but it 
could also be from your next door neighbor since any one can create a document in 
the Web.  The most amazing aspects of the Web is the ability to conect to 
computers around the world.  I recently connected to 
<A href="http://www.sunet.se:80/stockholm/"><b>Stockholm, Sweden</b></A> and looked at the 
information they have on museums and the water festival.  The most amazing graphics are 
available to view.</P>

<LI><A NAME="QQ2"><B>What kind of information about Spain is available in the Web?</B></A>
<P>Through the Web we could get a grasp about the culture in Spain.  It tells us what 
Spain offers us as tourists and as students.  In the Web we can learn what a great 
cultural center Spain is, especilly in literature a nd paintings.  Men like 
Velazquez, Goya, Quevedo and Cervantes got their inspiration in this country.  Books 
mainly talk about the history and that is sometimes boring. In the Web I learned that 
looking things up can be fun because most of the information is current and 
interactive.  By clicking on a map of Spain you could get information on a specific 
region.  For example <A href="http://www.uji.es/Spain-www.html"><b>Spain</b></A> the 
home page offers you different e-mail addresses to establish correspondance with 
someone in the universities there.  What a better way to get hands on information 
about the style of life the Spaniards live.  Furthermore as students, university 
information is available and it tells you the different  programs they are offering 
in the different regions.  What I enjoyed more about being able to answer this 
question was looking at the tourist information they have available.  Take a look at 
the <A href="http://www.eunet.es/hotels/index.html"><b>Guia turistica de 
Espana!.</b></A> Here you have access to information such as a brief version of the 
history, places to visit and information about the food.  Unfortunatelly the only 
provice available is Madrid, but I'm sure soon enough more information will be 
available.</p>

<LI><A NAME="QQ3"><B>How can you find interesting information within the field of social sciences? </B></A>
Is easy to find information in the field of Social Sciences, is a matter of going into 
the web's virtual library in <A 
href="http://coombs.anu.edu.au/WWWVL-SocSci.html"><b>Social Sciences</b></A> and you 
have more information there than in any other source I have worked with.  Social 
Sciences is a very general field covering anything from Asian Studies and Museums to 
issues from the United Nations.  A topic I was interested in exploring was the United 
Nations so I linked to the Virtual library <A
href="http://www.undcp.or.at/unlinks.html"><b>United Nations</b></A> and read about 
the Red Cross, the Childrens fund in Singapore and trading points.</p>

HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ4"><B>How can one create a page to view in Mosaic?</B></A>
Is a simple thing to do.  You need to create your document by using HTML (HyperText 
Markup Language).  This is the language the computer will use to interpret what you 
are telling it.  It requires you to follow specific rules to "tag" or "mark" parts in 
the document.  It may at times be frustrating to follow these rules, one missing tag 
could distort the document but once you learn them, is easy.  Another advantage to 
usng the HTML form is that it is compatible with any browser so anyone can have 
access to you file being able to retrieve it from any browser not only Mosaic.  To 
learn how to create a HTML document you can access the James Pollell introduction to 
<A href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/html-jpowell/"><b>HTML.</b></A> Once you 
read it and learn how to creat the document then you are ready to make your own home 
page and access it through Mosaic.  a demo document for <A 
href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/demo.html"><b>Mosaic!</b></A>is available.  
Once you create a document using the web is twice as fun.</p>

<LI><A NAME="QQ5"><B>Where can you find sources in Spanish to practice reading as well as learn about other places where the official language is spanish?</B></A>
I have found that most of the sources that you find in the web from another country are 
in the language of the country that is  being presented.  I turned my attention in 
the home page for <A href="http://lanic.utexas.edu/las.html"><b>Latin American 
Studies</b></A> her you find a list of different countries that you can explore.  For 
example <A href="http://lanic.utexas.edu/la/Argentina"><b> Argentina!</b></a> detailed 
information can be found about the history, geography, government and currency.  Is 
also possible to find out about the current events in the country of choice.  For 
example <a href="http://www.igc.apc.org/nacla/mexico.html"><b>Mexico</b></a> in this 
article you  find the different issues Mexico is currently involved in.  For example 
the presidential elections that just passed.  This page provides a picture of the 
candidates as well as an abstract of the issues.  Keeping up with current events is 
hard but keeping up with current events from another country is double the trouble 
and the web makes it easy.</P>
