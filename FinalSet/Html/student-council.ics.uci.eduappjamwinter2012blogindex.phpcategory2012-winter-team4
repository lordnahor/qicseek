<p><strong>Current Status of the Project<br />
</strong>I am happy to report that our app is fully functional, seemingly bug free, and has been optimized for speed.  We also implemented some features last minute that we didn&#8217;t believe we would have time to complete.  We are currently thoroughly testing our app to ensure that it is bug free. Looking forward to presenting our app tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Today:</strong></p>
<p>We made some major progress today including debugging issues that were left over from last night, adding multiple extra features that were on our &#8220;if we have time&#8221; list.  We had several bugs pop up throughout the day, but they have all seemingly been corrected.  Our app was also taking long periods of time to load data (20-30 seconds initially) and sometimes even cause the app to stop responding.  We spent some time today figuring out how to optimize our apps performance and drastically reduce those loading times.  We also made some last minute changes to our database tables to allow for new functionality to be added.  Overall today was really intense, but also really fun and exciting as we passed our initial expectations and gone above and beyond what we thought possible (I&#8217;m jealous I don&#8217;t have an android to run this app myself).<br />
We also finished our poster, power point presentation, and app documentation.</p>
<p>We also enjoyed not one, but TWO visits from Peter the photographer today. He was present during the extremely intense final moments as we scrambled to get our documents together and submitted with 5 minutes to go before midnight. I&#8217;m sure he got some fun pictures.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<p>Limitations with the database required changes. Serious loading times presented us with a dilemma, should we spend time optimizing our app for a speedy performance or work on adding additional features? We were fortunately able to accomplish both. We also had some last minutes bugs that sent us into a minor panic, but it looks like we&#8217;ve worked them all out.</p>

<p><strong>Current Status of the Project<br />
</strong>Our app is currently at 80% complete. We got a bulk of the work done today.   We met up today at 1pm today and have stayed together until midnight.  We&#8217;re not having as many challenges as we expected, so today&#8217;s workflow was extremely efficient.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Today:</strong><br />
<em>Android (Client Side ):</em></p>
<p><em></em>The majority of the app&#8217;s functionality was implemented. Aesthetics were tremendously updated. Added almost all of the necessary connections with the database.</p>
<p><em>Server/Database:<br />
</em>We have completed our database.</p>
<p><em>Design/UI:</em><br />
We got our design at 100%.   We finished all of our icons and artwork.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<p>Limitations with the database required us to change how we handled several aspects of the app.  Issues with figuring out how do certain things with the android code were frustrating, but we figured them out after plenty of time spent debugging.</p>

<div class="content">
<p><strong>Current Project Status:</strong></p>
<p>The app is in a working, functional state and has been tested on our Android devices. Though working, it is still lacking much of the functionality we would like to implement by Monday, including being able to make certain changes to information in the database as well as implementing certain social aspects of our app. We have a good sized to-do list for the next couple days, but given the progress we were able to make today we should be able to finish at least most of what we hope to by the deadline.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Today:</strong></p>
<p><em></em>The majority of today was spent writing the java code to manage the data from the database locally, writing the php code to connect to the java to the database, displaying the information in the correct activities, and modifying the formatting of our UI to make it more aesthetically pleasing. We also worked on creating an icon/logo for our app as well as our Power Point Presentation and Group Poster.</p>
<p>We also enjoyed a pleasant visit from Adam More today who patiently took candid photographs of us despite horrible lighting conditions (the sun was shining straight through the window and blindingly reflecting off of everything).<br />
<strong><br />
Challenges:</strong></p>
<p>Figuring out how to manage the data after retrieving it from the database was a learning experience for most of us, and after quite a bit of debugging we finally have it working. We have also had some issues with version control, mainly with issues with the project properties and R.java files that don&#8217;t seem to update correctly every time, but it hasn&#8217;t been too much of an issue overall.</p>

<p><strong>Current Project Status:<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Today, I&#8217;m happy to report, we have made some steady progress.  We are almost finished creating the Activities for the app, though there is still work to be done with the UI itself. We&#8217;ve begun connecting the client-side to the database, which will allow us to begin implementing the actual functionality of our app and finish the UI as we go along.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Today:</strong></p>
<p><em>Android (Client Side):</em></p>
<p>Major progress compared to the past few days. Breakthroughs made at the end of last night made it easy to build more today. Most of the Activities have been created, and several have been implemented.  The primary navigation aspect of our UI is about 90% complete, only needing to add aspects we haven&#8217;t fully decided on yet. Right now our app can be run on an android device and the UI can be navigated, and modified locally, though few or no database connections have yet been established and implemented.</p>
<p><em>DataBase/Server:</em></p>
<p>Database is up and running.  Our login/registration is just about complete and connected to the client-side UI. Integration with the client-side code has begun, though slight changes in design may require some minor reworkings of the database structure.</p>
<p><em>Design:<br />
</em></p>
<p>Upon further consideration, our previous design seemed a bit out of scope for this project, as well as a bit broad in terms of overall functionality.  We brainstormed ideas that will make the app simpler while also bringing the purpose of the app into better focus for the user. We have many ideas for our app that we would like to implement after the competition, but are not realistic given our deadline.<br />
<strong><br />
Challenges:</strong></p>
<p>The study room we were planning on using well into the night closed much earlier than we were planning so we had to improvise and relocate.  3/5 members were able to meet when originally planned, but the other 2 were unable to join up until a few hours later.  Fortunately we were all able to get together and really start to bring the project together.  However, the process of trying to combine the different pieces of the project wasn&#8217;t quite as smooth as we had hoped, but we worked on it and everything appears to be functioning correctly. We have high hopes for the weekend and are excited to see what we can accomplish.</p>

<p><strong>Current Project Status:<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Today, most of us (4 out of 5) met up from 6:30pm until exhaustion.  We have assigned responsibilities (design, client side, and back-end) to every person, so we all immediately began our individual work.  The back-end side of our project is only being worked on by one person, but he has been able to catch up to the rest of the teams.  Our communication has been excellent, and we have all been comfortable discussing our project in an effective and orderly manner.  We are using a google document to record our status, to-do lists, and design.   We are still in the early stages in our client side, but we have reached a complete and tangible design which we will be implementing in the next few days.  The rush is building, and we are all excited for what is to come as our last few days approach us.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Today:</strong></p>
<p><em>Android (Client Side):</em></p>
<p>We worked through a ton of issues with running SDK on everyone&#8217;s computer.  We finally started making progress on the client side. We have coded a barebones design of our project and have got it to run on our android devices.  The next few days will be when this section will be picking up.</p>
<p><em>DataBase/Server:</em></p>
<p>Created and completed a fully functional login/registration screen. We also worked on the validation of the logins. We are preparing our database to handle the kind of data our design will be needing.  We also worked on the android-to-database connection.</p>
<p><em>Design:<br />
</em></p>
<p>The design concept of our project has been completed. We planned out a realistic design of our project&#8211;in regards to time constraints.  We also planned a more detailed and complete design if time permits.   Our design has been documented and we are now in the progress of drawing out each individual screen in order to leave the client side of the project with little questions on the design.<br />
<strong><br />
Challenges:</strong></p>
<p>As with other teams, time availability for our members have been a problem.  Today, only one member could not make it to our meeting.  One of our biggest problems have still been with SDK, and solving technical problems with everyone&#8217;s computers.  We also had trouble with simplifying our project so that our design is realistic with the time constraints that we have.</p>

<p>Current Project Status:  Design is essentially finished, with room to be flexible as development progresses. We are ready to start programming tomorrow which is our first heavy work day.</p>
<p>Progress Today:  Today was full of schedule conflicts/work/projects/etc. so our group did not meet today. We had decided ahead of time that we would most likely not meet today so that we could use any extra time we had today to focus on other school work we needed to get done this week so that we could better focus on App Jam on Thursday when our schedules lined up much better. (Essentially today was &#8220;if you have anything you need to do tomorrow, do it today so tomorrow is free&#8221;).</p>
<p>Challenges: Schedule conflicts led to solution above.</p>

Meeting times have been difficult to coordinate for the first few days of the competition, but we have solid meetings for the latter half of the competition and will have on-the-spot meetings whenever possible until then.</p>
