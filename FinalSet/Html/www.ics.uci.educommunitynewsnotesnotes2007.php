<p><strong><a name="academicanalytics"></a>Networked Systems program ranked #1 by Academic Analytics </strong></p>
<p>The Bren School's computer science program in Networked Systems has been ranked number one in new study by Academic Analytics, a for-profit company that partners with the State University of New York.</p>
<p>Also, in this year's study, Information Science/Studies at the UC Irvine's Bren School ranks fourth. </p>
<p><strong>About Networked Systems<br/>
		        </strong>The Networked Systems program at the Bren School provides education and research opportunities to graduate students in the areas of computer networks and telecommunication networks.</p>
<p>Networked Systems include telephone networks, cable TV networks, cellular phone networks, and the Internet, as well as other emerging networks.</p>
<p>Networked Systems are inherently interdisciplinary. By their design, they connect devices such as computer and phones using communications methods. Networked Systems therefore must address the combination of software, hardware, and communications.</p>
<p>As a result, the Networked Systems area spans traditional departmental boundaries. At a minimum, the area draws heavily from Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Electrical Engineering.</p>
<p>At UCI, these areas are housed in two departments, ICS and EECS. The Networked Systems program unites the strengths of these two departments and provides more integrated M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in this area.</p>
<p><strong>About Informatics (Information Science)</strong><br/>
		        Informatics is the interdisciplinary study of the design, application, use, and impact of information technology. It goes beyond technical design to focus on the relationship between information system design and use in real-world settings.</p>
<p>These investigations lead to new forms of system architecture, new approaches to system design and development, new means of information system implementation and deployment, and new models of interaction between technology and social, cultural, and organizational settings.</p>
<p>In the Bren School, Informatics is concerned with software architecture, software development, design and analysis, programming languages, ubiquitous computing, information retrieval and management, human-computer interaction, computer-supported cooperative work, and other topics that lie at the relationship between information technology design and use in social and organizational settings</p>
<p>Academic Analytics bases their ranking of doctoral programs on publications, citations of journal publications, federal research funding, and awards and honors.</p>

                      Kay</strong></p>
</div>
<p>On November 16 and 17, 2007, Senior Lecturer <strong>David G. Kay</strong> served as Chief Justice in three rounds of the National Entertainment Law Moot Court Competition.</p>
<p>Law students from across the country competed by making Supreme Court arguments in a hypothetical case involving copyright and trademark infringement on the World-Wide Web.  </p>
<p>One party in the case hosted a web site with videos posted by users; a user posted a copyrighted video and the copyright owner wanted to hold the web site host responsible for the infringement.  </p>
<p>Another issue was the use of a competitor's domain name in a metatag, and whether that constituted trademark infringement by diverting users away from the competitor.  </p>
<p>Kay, who is a lawyer as well as a computer scientist, said, "Internet issues come up frequently in the entertainment industry, and those issues often have novel legal implications.  It's useful for computer scientists to have an understanding of the legal system because increasingly, technologists and lawyers need to work together in the development of new products and services."  </p>
<p>The Bren School has a long history of addressing these issues in its curriculum. </p>
<p>Informatics 131, Social Analysis of Computerization, and Informatics 269, Computer Law, are two courses on this theme.  A general education course on technical issues in public policy is also planned for the 2008-09 academic year.</p>

<p><strong>Charlotte P. Lee</strong>, a research scientist in the Department of Informatics, has been awarded a $449,000 grant from the National Science foundation to study collaboration in the development of cyberinfrastructure. </p>
<p>Recent years have seen the rise of new forms of cyberinfrastructure which are large-scale distributed scientific enterprises supported primarily through advanced technological infrastructure such as supercomputers and high speed networks. </p>
<p>One of the primary goals of cyberinfrastructure is to transform scientific and engineering practice, yet the nature of these transformations are poorly understood.</p>
<p>Lee's research will systematically study the transformations that cyberinfrastructure is created to engender. </p>
<p>Using ethnographic methods, she will investigate: </p>
<ul>
<li>existing scientific and engineering practices</li>
<li>how scientific and engineering practices are collaboratively transformed in the creation of cyberinfrastructure</li>
<li>patterns of collaboration (e.g. social networks, communication strategies, management strategies) and relate those patterns to organizational and scientific outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p>This research will make empirical and conceptual contributions to ongoing research in areas such as computer supported cooperative work and science and technology studies. </p>
<p>Furthermore, this research will stimulate and support the development of future cyberinfrastructures.</p>

<p><strong><a name="grads_ibm"></a>Graduate students place first in IBM competition</strong> </p>
<p>Bren School graduate students <strong>Jayram Moorkanikara Nageswaran</strong> and <strong>Jeff Furlong</strong> and their counterparts Ashok Chandrashekar and Andrew Felch from the Dartmouth College have placed first in the first annual Cell Broadband Engine (Cell/B.E.) </p>
<p>Processor University Challenge sponsored by IBM.  The competition was a part of the 2007 Power Architecture Conference held in Austin, TX.</p>
<p>In the winning project, a cluster of Sony PlayStation3's was used for large-scale modeling of the human brain. </p>
<p>Using the same technology that runs in today's video games, the team created a low-cost cluster able to support the complex algorithms used in brain research. </p>
<p>This study addressed issues of known difficulty in visual processing; for example, using standard processors, the complex computations needed to emulate the human brain's ability to rapidly and effortlessly recognize objects, was found to be slow and inefficient. </p>
<p>By exploiting Cell/B.E.'s parallel instruction set and extending it into low-cost clusters using Sony PS3s, the students were able to show a 100x performance boost over smaller clusters.</p>
<p>Nearly 80,000 students from 25 countries competed in the Challenge, which consisted of online trivia about Cell/B.E. -- originally designed by IBM, Sony Group and Toshiba Corp., for use in consumer devices such as Sony Computer Entertainment's PLAYSTATION3 -- followed by an opportunity to invent their own applications using this powerful processor.</p>
<p> "This contest provided a growth opportunity for students to gain real-life, multi-disciplinary skills to apply to their futures as they move from the classroom to the workforce," said Nick Donofrio, IBM executive vice president, Innovation and Technology. "This challenge also proved the true power, potential and promise of student innovations."</p>

</div>
<p>Nature Physics has published "Is the outer Solar System chaotic?", a paper by computer science professor <strong>Wayne Hayes</strong>.</p>
<p>The orbits of the inner planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) are known to be practically stable in the sense that none of them will collide or be ejected from the Solar System for the next few billion years.  </p>
<p>However, their orbits are chaotic in the sense that we cannot predict their angular positions those stable orbits for more than about 20 million years.  </p>
<p>The picture is less clear for the outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune).  </p>
<p>Again their orbits are practically stable, but in this paper we show not only that we may not be able to predict where the outer planets will be in the future, but also that we do not even know, at present, how long our predictions are accurate.  </p>
<p>Our predictions may be accurate for 5 million years, or 5 billion, or anywhere in between.</p>
<p>Hayes' primary interest is currently in testing the reliability of large-scale physical simulations such as galaxy and cosmological n-body simulations as performed by astronomers. </p>
<p>More generally, he is interested in rigorous verification of numerical solutions of differential equation systems using validated interval arithmetic. </p>
<p>He is also interested in combinatorial graph theory, for example in bounding the Graph Ramsey Numbers.</p>

</div>
<p>Assistant professor of informatics <strong>Donald Patterson</strong> has been been awarded a grant of over $400,000 from the National Science Foundation to develop a context aware Instant Messaging (IM) client.</p>
<p>Although computers have access to many embedded sensors, like GPS, automated assistance for alleviating<br/>
		        inappropriate IM interruptions remains elusive. </p>
<p>In a world in which users are available for some purposes, but not for others one indication of interruptibility no longer fits the needs of users.</p>
<p>Patterson's research aims to explore ways to close the semantic gap between what computers can sense and what people can understand by developing, deploying and testing a context-aware IM client, Nomatic*Gaim. </p>
<p>Rather than attempting to determine context directly, it attempts to keep the human in the loop, so that IM communications are more efficient in an increasingly always online world. </p>
<p>Ultimately the goal is for computers to treat context as more than a parameter to a program, so that in this way, users and their devices can come to a shared understanding of the world, which  then has implications for the behavior of both device and user.</p>

<p>Associate professor of informatics<strong> Crista Lopes</strong>, professor of computer science <strong>Michael Goodrich</strong>, professor of chemical engineering and materials science Stanley Grant and Roberto Tamassia from Brown University have received a $1.1 million NSF grant to create a more open version of the <a href="http://www.calswim.org/">California Sustainable Watershed Information Manager (CalSWIM) website</a>.</p>
<p>Currently, CalSWIM, which provides access to stream monitoring data and relevant GIS geospatial data, is a closed cyberinfrastructure, with updates controlled by a small number of individuals, and any changes to it requiring the intervention of web-knowledgeable professionals.</p>
<p>The updated website will utilize a wiki that will allow watershed stakeholders &#8211; scientists, regulators, and the general public - the ability to update the site directly, without requiring them to have web programming knowledge.</p>
<p>The aim is to create a  publicly updatable encyclopedia of &#8220;all things watershed&#8221; that includes all watersheds in California. </p>
<p>By transforming CalSWIM into an Open Collaborative Information Repository, in the form of a wiki, the researchers will enable it to become a sustainable, expandable, outreaching, and continually up-to-date resource. </p>
<p>The researchers will also focus on developing a trust management component based on a mixture of access control systems, reputation management systems, and data integrity algorithms that will minimize the existence of poor-quality information and also minimize the effect of malicious information manipulation.</p>
<p>The researchers hope the trust management component developed in this project can be applied to a variety of Collaborative Information Repositories that share the properties of CalSWIM &#8212; namely, data-based collaboration between scientists, regulatory agencies, and the general public.</p>

<p>The research will focus on studying modular design within  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming">Aspect-Oriented  Programming (AOP)</a>. AOP attempts to aid programmers by breaking down a program into distinct parts that overlap in functionality as little as possible.</p>
<p>Throughout the history of technology, modular design has proven to be an effective way to deal with systems' complexity. </p>
<p>Modular design is an effective way to deal with a systems' complexity and is routinely applied to software-intensive systems.  </p>
<p>By AOP, some modules called &#8220;aspects&#8221; directly address the  crosscutting nature of some design concerns by modeling those concerns from  outside the modules to which the local effects belong.</p>
<p>The researchers will  conduct a large-scale empirical validation of the design hypothesis put forth by  AOP, and leveraging it to derive principles for modular design. </p>
<p>The empirical validation of  AOP will be enabled by an infrastructure called sourcerer, developed for  collecting, searching, and analyzing software on the very-large scale of Open  Source software available on the Internet. </p>

<p>The Bren School's Women in Information and Computer Sciences (WICS) was recently recognized at the 2007 Anteater Awards. WICS won the Most Outstanding New Program Award for their Mock Technical Interview program.</p>
<p>Inspired by the Career Center's On-Campus Interview and various   interview workshops, WICS started a Mock Technical Interview event in which students can have the opportunity to have a one-on-one mock interview with an actual employer. </p>
<p>This new program is unique because it allows the students to gauge their interviewing techniques as well as test their technical qualifications with a company representative who knows exactly what type of skills set are necessary for the IT position. </p>
<p>It prepares the students by letting them know what type of technical questions will be asked, what type of responses are expected, and why they are asked without the pressure of trying to obtain the job.</p>
<p>Representatives from seven different companies Northrop Grumman, Capital Group, Google, Relsys, Sony, Unisys, and Deloitte attended providing students a total of 35 twenty-minute interview slots, 6 forty-five- minute interview slots, and 7 resume critique slots. </p>
<p>WICS was also awarded with an Outstanding Service Award from Girls Inc. of range County on April 26th, 2007 for our Elementary School Outreach Roadshow.</p>
<p>The 2nd annual Elementary School Outreach Roadshow brought 30 girls to tour part of the UCI campus; learn what computer science is, who computer scientists are, how technology can affect people, why it's fun to learn and work in the computer science fields; and have lunch with college students. </p>
<p>The girls were able to  interact with  "Navigating a Digital World" with Professor Meyers from the School of Engineering and "The EcoRaft Project" with Professor Tomlinson from the Bren School of ICS as well as learn about the HIPerWall.</p>
<p>WICS attributes the success of the Roadshow to Dean Debra J. Richardson, the Bren School Student Affairs Office, the Bren School External Affairs, the University Club, the UCI Bookstore, Suzanne K. Schaefer, Professor Bill Tomlinson and his research students, Professor Joerg Meyer, CalIt2 and the HIPerWall, an anonymous donor, and the Girls Inc. elementary school coordinator, Kimberly Harnish.</p>
<p>WICS was established to help and encourage women to pursue a college degree and a successful career in the information and computer sciences field.		        </p>

<p>BMRC taught classes on multimedia authoring, established and operated authoring studios and distributed collaboration and distance learning rooms and services, and provided advice and technical support on a wide range of issues relating to multimedia authoring and distributed collaboration. </p>
<p>A major BMRC accomplishment was the development and deployment of the Berkeley Webcasting System, which produces over 30 hours a week of Berkeley course lectures that are viewed over 300,000 times per month by people anywhere on the Internet. </p>
<p>His past research interests have included development tools for database applications, distributed operating systems, computer networks (multicast protocols and applications), distributed streaming media toolkits, multimedia applications (video-on-demand, webcasting, videoconferencing, multimedia authoring, etc.), and computer-integrated manufacturing. </p>
<p>Rowe was co-founder of Ingres Corporation, and under his direction the company became well-known by industry as the pioneer in the development of easy-to-use tools for database access. </p>
<p>He also co-founded Orinda Software and more recently n-Cast Corporation, a company likely to play a very important role in the further development of presentation capture and streaming media technologies.</p>
<p>Rowe continues to work as consultant for many companies including Apple, Dust Inc., Eloquent, Fast Forward Networks, FX Palo Alto Laboratories, Harris Semiconductor, Hughes Aircraft, Motorola, Sematech, Siemens and Tandem. </p>
<p>He has also published more than 70 papers on multimedia systems and applications, programming systems, and database systems. </p>
<p>Rowe is a member of the editorial board of the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) Multimedia Systems Journal, past chair of ACM Special Interest Group on Multimedia, a member of the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE), and has served on many governmental advisory committees. </p>
<p>In 1998, Rowe was inducted as a Fellow of ACM for his seminal contributions to programming languages, relational database technology, user interfaces and multimedia systems. </p>
<p>Rowe will be recognized along with 16 alumni, faculty, staff, students and friends  for their ongoing contributions to the university during the  37th annual ceremony.</p>
<p>Initiated in 1971, the Lauds and Laurels ceremony provides a  way to recognizes alumni, students, faculty, staff and friends who have brought  recognition to the university through their achievements, studies or  profession.</p>
<p>To date, tributes to more than 600 community members have  been a part of the ceremony. This year&#8217;s event will take place May 10, 2007, at  the Hyatt Regency Irvine. </p>

<p><strong><strong>Jeff Fulkerson</strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"> has made history by becoming the first Bren School student to run for  UCI Homecoming King. </span></strong></p>
<p>But the  fourth-year ICS major needs the help of his fellow computer scientists to win. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.elections.uci.edu/">Vote for him at the ASUCI web site</a> by 4 p.m. on Thursday, Feb. 1. </p>
<p>Then attend the men's basketball game against Cal State Northridge on Saturday, Feb. 3 when the Homecoming King and Queen will be crowned at halftime. </p>
<p>Fulkerson, whose hobbies include Rubik's Cube, music and film editing, is also a resident advisor, Campuswide Honors Program Peer Mentor and member of the Campuswide Honors Student Council, Golden Key and Chi Alpha. </p>
<p>"For me, being on the Homecoming Court would mean many things," Fulkerson said. "It would mean continuing my trend of breaking stereotypes.  It would mean I&#8217;ve accomplished something memorable.  It would mean that instead of me supporting my residents, my residents would get a chance to support me."</p>

</div>
<p>UC Irvine's Academic Senate Council has awarded <strong>Donald Patterson</strong>, assistant professor of informatics, $3,500 in travel funding to study context-aware networking routing algorithms in Africa.</p>
<p>Context-aware networking algorithms allow users to transmit data even when the local network infrastructure has been destroyed.</p>
<p>For example, if a natural disaster destroyed an area&#8217;s local network infrastructure, aid workers with mobile data devices on the ground would still be able to transmit data back to headquarters for coordinating logistics. </p>
<p>By creating a routing system that knew which device belonged to the "coordinator" and which device belonged to a "field nurse" it could make better decisions about which direction to push data when the devices come in contact. </p>
<p>The coordinator's device could offload data to the Internet when it returns to a location with established infrastructure.</p>
<p>Patterson, working with two non-governmental health organizations, will be surveying two sites in South Africa and Zambia.</p>
<p>Patterson plans to evaluate work flow and movement patterns of participants in the organizations to develop an architecture which routes on the basis of contextual clues, but is also helpful to the organizations on the ground.</p>
<p>Patterson&#8217;s areas of research interest lie at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Ubiquitous computing and he has applied this work to transportation and activity assistance.		        </p>

</div>
<p><strong><strong>Natasa Przulj</strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">, assistant professor of computer science, has received a $570,000 National Science Foundation CAREER grant in support of her 5-year project entitled "</span><i><span style="font-weight: normal;">CAREER: Tools for Analyzing, Modeling, and Comparing Protein-Protein Interaction Networks</span></i><span style="font-weight: normal;">".</span></strong></p>
<p>The project proposes improvements in tools for analyzing and modeling of Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks.  </p>
<p>A PPI network is a mathematical representation of the physical interactions amongst proteins in a cell: it is a graph in which nodes represent proteins and edges between the nodes represent possible physical interactions between the corresponding proteins.</p>
<p>It is expected that the project will lead to better algorithms for various network comparison problems on PPI and other networks. Exploitation of a network model may significantly reduce the cost of characterizing the interactomes of various organisms.</p>
<p>Dr. Przulj is involved in training high school, undergraduate and graduate students, including two female students.  This work is being included in various UC Irvine courses.  The software will be provided as a free open-source toolkit for other researchers.</p>
