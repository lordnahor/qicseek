  <p class="style5">General Philosophy: </p>
  <div class="indentRight">
    <p>I prefer to give many small assignments which build up a picture of overall student learning success rather than to rely on one or two large exams which students may bomb based on non-learning related complications.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>At the end of the day, learning is the responsibility of the student. I consider myself someone who points students in the right direction and can/will explain the fundamentals of a subject  matter. I can't actually do the work of learning for a student. That takes effort and self-initiative. I will help to provide structure and motivation for that learning, but  you also need to learn how to expand on this subject yourself.  In a technical field like this,  you will be left behind the field in about six months, regardless of how well I present the subject matter, if you can't keep learning on your own. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I like to stop talking periodically and let students ask questions. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="indentRight"></div>
</div>
<div class="container">
  <p class="style5">Class Attendance:</p>
  <div class="indentRight">
    <p> Attendance will be kept track of through index cards and weekly quizzes at the beginning of class. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The index cards are also a means for me to get feedback about the course.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>For each class please write your name on a card, the date, your student ID and a comment/question about the course.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If you would like to submit an anonymous comment, take an extra card and don't put your name on it. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I keep track of attendance because I need consistent class participation in order to make this course function well. </p>
  </div>
  <p class="style5">&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="indentRight"></div>
</div>
<div class="container">
  <p class="style5">Design Notebook: </p>
  <div class="indentRight">
    <p>You should begin, starting the first week, a design notebook which you carry around in your pocket/purse/murse. On it you should jot down at least one example per week of a user interface success or failure that you encounter and make some notes/sketches about for it. Your notebook will be turned in periodically during the class.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p> It must be  hard copy format rather than digital. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A typical entry should be a page or two. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The goal of the design notebook is to develop a practice of thinking like a designer, maker, creator, builder. </p>
  </div>
  <p class="style5">&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="indentRight"></div>
</div>
<div class="container">
  <p class="style5">In-Class Assignments </p>
  <div class="indentRight">
    <p>Several  assignments will be assigned consisting primarily of group learning tasks. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The goal of the projects will be to get hands on experience with user interface evaluation techniques.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="indentRight"></div>
</div>
<div class="container">
  <p class="style5">Quizzes</p>
  <div class="indentRight">
    <p>Several quizzes will be  assigned covering the assigned readings and discussions in class.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The goal of the quizzes is to motivate you to learn the material in the text book and lecture in preparation for class exercises.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>They are also designed to make sure you arrive to class on time, as this class is dang-early. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="indentRight"></div>
</div>
<div class="container">
  <p class="style5">Facebook</p>
  <div class="indentRight">
    <p>We'll also experiment with a Facebook page for this class as well this quarter. Announcements should be mirrored on the Facebook page, but who knows if Facebook will show you anything, so email is our official communications channel.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="indentRight"></div>
</div>
<div class="container">
  <p class="style5">Laptop use </p>
  <div class="indentRight">
    <p>Not withstanding the Facebook page, I am going to request that you close your laptops during this class. There will be a lot of exercises that won't work if you are day-trading at the same time (or whatever). </p>
    </div>
  <div class="indentRight"></div>
</div>
<div class="container">
  <p class="style5">Coffee Club </p>
  <div class="indentRight">
    <p>If there is sufficient interest we can arrange to have coffee in class. We will discuss arrangements in class. </p>
