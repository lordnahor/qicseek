<H3>Current Courses</H3>
<UL>
<LI> Fall, 2013
<p> I am on sabbatical this quarter.  
This means that I may not be responding to email as quickly as I otherwise 
would.

<LI> Winter, 2014
<UL>
<LI> <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dillenco/compsci261/">CompSci 261 
- Data Structures</a>
</UL

<br>
<p>
I am aware that as of now, demand for CompSci 261 exceeds available enrollment.
We will do what we can to address this issue.  
I realize that everyone who is trying to enroll in the course and is unable
to enroll has a compelling reason for taking the course.  
In the interest of fairness, I will not be responding to individual requests 
that I give certain individuals priority in enrolling at the expense of others.
