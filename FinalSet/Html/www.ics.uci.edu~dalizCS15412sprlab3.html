<h2> Lab 3</h2>
<p> The objective of this lab assignment is to design and
implement a register file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The register file
implements 32 registers, each of which is 32 bits wide. Register number
0 is a zero register; its content is always 0 and cannot be changed.
Register 1 through 31 store any value assigned to them. Access to
registers beyond 31 is not allowed.
</p>
<p>We use <span style="font-style: italic;">data</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">address</span>
and
<span style="font-style: italic;">control</span>
ports to interface with the
register file. There should be 3 data ports: 2 for reading and
1 for writing. During each clock cycle, values from 2 registers can be
read through the 2 read ports (<i style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><b>d_out_1</b></i>
and <i style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><b>d_out_2</b></i>)
and 1 can be
written through the write port (<i style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><b>d_in</b></i>).
All 3 data ports are 32-bit wide.</p>
<p>Use address ports <i><b><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">rd_addr_1</span>, <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">rd_addr_2</span></b></i>
and <i style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><b>wr_addr</b></i>
to supply addresses
of registers that will be read from or written to. For example, if <i>rd_addr_1</i>
is set to 1 and <i>rd_addr_2</i> is set to 3, then the
value in register 1 and 3 can be read from data port <i>d_out_1</i>
and <i>d_out_2</i> at the same time.</p>
<p>In addition to these ports, your register file needs to
use a <i style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><b>wr_en</b></i>
control signal to write the value on port <i>d_in</i> to a
register addressed by <i>wr_addr</i> in the register file.
The register file also needs a clock signal (port <i style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><b>clk</b></i>).
Write operations are synchronized with this clock.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
You will need an array of vectors to implement the register file.</p>

<p>Draw a block
diagram of the register file as is described
above. To make things easier, the register file has <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">only 8 registers</span></span>.
You can represent the middle registers with ... and show only register
0, 1, 2 ... and 7</p>
You may use the following basic blocks: 32 bit register (with
write enable), MUX and 3-8 decoder.
<p>The register write_enable signal literally enables
writing to
the
register. When each rising edge of the clock signal arrives, the
register will only update its value if wr_en = 1.&nbsp;Otherwise,
nothing will hapen.<br>

Figure&nbsp;1. 32 bit register with write-enable.</p>
<p>
The MUX selectes
one of the 8 inputs and sends it to the output, according to the 3-bit
selection signal on the left. <br>

Figure 2. Multiplexer with 8 32-bit inputs.</p>
<p>The 3-to-8 decoder, when
enabled,&nbsp;"translates" the 3-bit input (for example,
an address) into one of the 8 outputs (for example, to drive 8 enable
siganls for 8 different devices). <br>
<img alt="3-8 decoder" src="image/decoder.png" height="234" width="353"><br>

<p>Pay attention to the wiring. Label the wires with proper
signal names and mark the width.</p>

Your task is to design a&nbsp;register file module with 32
registers.
<p>The <a href="lab3.zip">template VHDL files</a>
have been provided to you. The interface (that is, ports) is already
defined. You need to add code for functionality in both files to make
them work. Do not make any change to the interface.</p>
<p>Since we are using an array to implement the register
file,
the decoder and the mux component is implemented automatically by the
array reference. The implementation should be very straight-forward.
Please refer to Prof. Veidenbaum's slides (<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Ealexv/154/HTML/L5/L51_files/Slide0005.gif">Slide
#5</a> and <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Ealexv/154/HTML/L5/L51_files/Slide0006.gif">#6</a>
of <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Ealexv/154/HTML/L5/index.htm">Lecture
5</a>). Our register file should be something like:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RegFile: <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">array</span> (0 to
31) <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">of
std_logic_vector</span>(31 downto 0);<br>
The
declaration in the slides has many named subtypes and constants. Some
of them are useful, and it will be a good idea to keep the declarations
in a seperate <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Ealexv/154/HTML/L5/L51_files/Slide0011.gif">package</a>
for future labs.</p>
<p>Index
to array elements should be of type "INTEGER". To convert a
signal of type STD_LOGIC_VECTOR to integer, you should use
funciton&nbsp;"<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">TO_INTEGER</span>".
It is declared in "<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">IEEE.NUMERIC_STD</span>"
package. The argument of this function should be either
STD_LOGIC_UNSIGNED or STD_LOGIC_SIGNED. So we woudl first cast our
STD_LOGIC_VECTOR to STD_LOGIC_UNSIGNED, then pass it to
TO_INTEGER.&nbsp;For example, to use wr_addr as array index, you
should use: <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">RegFile(
TO_INTEGER( UNSIGNED(wr_addr) ) )</span>;</p>
<p>You should use a process to implement the writing
operation. Think
about which signals should be in&nbsp;the sensitivity list
(wr_addr, wr_en, d_in, clk). Pay special attention to R0. When wr_addr
= "00000", an update should not happen.</p>

<p>In your test bench, you need to test your register file
module
for the following aspects:</p>
<p>Addressing: You must make sure that you are reading from
/
writing to the specific register you want. All addresses and data ports
need to be tested. This has to be done first, because the following
tests will test each register and to do that you must make sure you are
able to access each register. <br>
You should write unique values to different registers, and read from
them and see if what you read is what you have written.</p>
<p>Content: You must make sure that each register holds
what was
actually written. No "stuck at" errors exist. Each bit in each register
must be tested. <br>
You should write "000...0" and "111...1" to each register and read from
them and see if what you read is what you have written.</p>
<p>All input signals in test bench should be 1 clock long
and go high a
short time after a rising clock edge. Use assert instruction and
expected values to detect errors.</p>
<hr><b>What you should produce in this lab:</b>

<li>A block diagram of the register file you designed
that has 8 registers.</li>
