      <HR>

      <p><b>What do you do on the project?</b> I'm doing some programming on the project, and also some animating.</p>

<p><b>How long have you been with the group?</b> I joined last quarter, so about six months.</p>

<p><b>Why are you working on the project?</b> I was looking for a job, and I picked Bill's class, and I thought it would be a good learning experience and it sure has. I just wanted to experience what it was like working with other people on a project like this. </p>

<p><b>What do you think is the overall goal of the project?</b> I think the overall goal is to get a suitable software that deliver fun for kids that would be educational and on the same token for people who know more about technology, it's about exploring different technologies.</p>

<p><b>What was your favorite part of [or working on] the project?</b> I must say my favorite part would be modeling the plants. Since I haven't done it before, it took a lot of time and restarts, just basically banging your head on the same thing over and over again trying to get it to work.</p>

<p><b>What are your career goals/interests?</b> First graduate from this place, and go to business school or go work in my dad's company.</p>

<p><b>What are the other projects you've worked on?</b> I haven't done any projects for UCI, but I've done web design and stuff like that for other companies.</p>

<p><b>Have you gotten any awards and/or publications?</b> I've gotten an academic achievement award.</p>

<p><b>Any other questions and/or answers would you like on your site?</b> Not really.</P>
