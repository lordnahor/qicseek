            <p>The first breakout 
              session focused on surfacing what tools are currently used 
              and why. The stated goals of this session were to:</span></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Compile a list of the tools currently 
                used in building collaboratories, in order to get a map 
                of the current tools and technology landscape.</span></li>
              <li>Shed some light on the current 
                involvement of the collaboratory community in the development 
                of the tools they use.</span></li>
              <li>Build common ground for the following 
                breakout sessions.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Questions raised 
              to initiate conversation around this topic included:</span></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Which tools did you make that weren't 
                used? Which tools that you didn't make would have been used?</li>
              <li>Based on your real-world experiences, 
                what have been the biggest mistakes you have made in choosing 
                tools and technologies in collaboratories you have built? 
              </li>
              <li>What are categories and conceptual frameworks 
                that you use for organizing and thinking about these issues?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The facilitator 
              also brought up questions about the role of the collaboratory 
              community in the development of the tools and technologies 
              used in the community, such as:</span></p>
            <ul>
              <li>What tools and technologies are we 'driving', 
                or 'spinning off', which are we 'using'?</li>
              <li>Which specifications or standards are 
                reaching into our development? What's their relative importance?</li>
              <li>Would it be valuable to have a 'Collaboratory 
                Open Source' tool list and what would be on it?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>An observation arose that we need to be 
              aware of the various levels of granularity the group could 
              focus on. For example, with UARC, should we mention the Java 
              Applet, or the higher-level framework?</p>
            <p>Some talked about tools developed in-house 
              vs. those commercially developed. Developing tools in-house 
              often allows for the tools to be extended, without breaking 
              the existing capabilities. On the other hand, in-house efforts 
              suffer from rarely having the resources to maintain the tool 
              beyond its initial development, whereas commercial tools are 
              hopefully externally maintained, and upgraded. Efforts to 
              be platform neutral rules out a lot of commercial tools that 
              might already have the desired functionality, but only on 
              limited platforms. </p>
            <p>A problem mentioned with commercial tools 
              is that the company that develops the tool does not necessarily 
              have the &quot;business interests&quot; of the users in mind 
              - the business drivers of the company developing a commercial 
              tool are not those of most collaboratory researchers. This 
              has been known to result in a company dropping their support 
              of an aspect of the tool that was key to the operation of 
              one of the groups using the tool. (For example, in the case 
              of Internet2 and Microsoft, Microsoft dropped their support 
              of MPEG2, while Internet2 relied on MPEG2 for some of their 
              apps.)</p>
            <p>Discussion of these tools often hit upon 
              the subject of interoperability between tools. Chat tools 
              were an example of a functionality implemented with many variations 
              (AOL/Yahoo/MS instant messengers, Ytalk, MOO, etc.), and getting 
              them to work together is a significant issue. Habanero was 
              brought up as a means of getting quick and easy sharing amongst 
              tools (&quot;collaboratizing applications&quot;), but it does 
              not necessarily give &quot;deeper sharing&quot; where everyone 
              is able to work on different parts. Collaboratory tools were 
              also seen as not generally infrastructure compatible (one 
              uses Habanaro, one uses Group Kit, etc). And there is a standing 
              need for means of single security and single sign-on.</p>
            <p>The workshop participants came together 
              for a group discussion after the breakout sessions. The group 
              quickly noted that it was unclear how to appropriately distinguish 
              between tools and capabilities, and between capabilities and 
              services.</p>
            <p>Defining what was meant by the term &quot;collaboratory&quot; 
              was a topic the participants kept returning to during the 
              workshop. Points raised included:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Can you have a collaboratory that 
                is used only by individuals? </span> 
                <ul>
                  <li> What if people use a tool, one-at-a-time, 
                    and then talk about it?</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Seems there can be collaboratories 
                within collaboratories </span> 
                <ul>
                  <li>Hierarchies of collaboratories - 
                    larger groups of collaboratories splitting up into smaller 
                    collaborative groups</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>People are often in multiple collaboratories 
                </span> 
                <ul>
                  <li>People can participate in multiple 
                    roles by way of collaboration. They can be a leader 
                    in one, an observer in another, and a participant in 
                    many more.</li>
                  <li>People drift in and out of groups, 
                    drifting into clumps that have varying degrees of persistence, 
                    size, rate of formation and dissolution, etc.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Question of whether the classroom 
                is a collaboratory </span> 
                <ul>
                  <li>Abowd doesn't treat classroom as 
                    collaboratory, but would when technologies move to meeting 
                    space</li>
                  <li>Hardin thinks distance education 
                    is a collaboratory </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li> The DOE tends to see collaboratory 
                as access to an instrument (microscope, radar, whatever)</li>
              <li>What is the collaboratory and 
                what is the pre-existing community? </span> 
                <ul>
                  <li>Is it the job of the collaboratory 
                    to create a community, or does the collaboratory assume 
                    a community? </li>
                  <li>If you make the job also making 
                    the community, that makes it that much harder</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>From this difficulty with defining exactly 
              what a collaboratory is, arose the observations that the technologies 
              commonly used in collaboratories were not necessarily serving 
              a need that was specific to a collaboratory, but were meeting 
              a more &quot;general human need.&quot; Further, the collaboratory 
              community was not usually creating new technologies, but instead 
              finding uses for technologies already out there. There was 
              the sense that this was a chicken and the egg situation, where 
              it was uncertain whether the tool was developed and the use 
              emerged, or if the need gave rise to the tool.</p>
            <p>Someone proposed that the job of the collaboratory 
              community might be to create &quot;ease of use&quot; amongst 
              these tools, and that one of our major roles is &quot;system 
              integrators.&quot; But there was concern in the group that 
              there is more to the community's role than system integration. 
              There was mention that our role was to play steward to the 
              collaboratories - taking care that all the elements of the 
              <a href="../../AboutSOC/index.php?Mission">Borromean rings</a> 
              were given attention. Others said that system builders build 
              for what we need now, where collaboratory builders are charged 
              with building what we need in the future - more of a moving 
              target.</p>
            <p>Discussion turned to what is &quot;best&quot; 
              for collaboratories. Should a collaboratory aim to exploit 
              the tools available on the market? Is there any sub-set, standards, 
              or specification that this group could agree on? Ideas included:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Seeing the development effort 
                from collaboratories as a middleware initiative. </span> 
                <ul>
                  <li> NSF, DOE initiatives</span></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Pushing for NSF funding for some 
                sort of organization that would take care of needs that 
                wouldn't be met by commercial entities</span></li>
              <li>Encouraging a business to develop 
                robust tools, something that can be hard for a small group 
                of researchers </span> 
                <ul>
                  <li> A &quot;Red Hat&quot;-like 
                    bundle of collaborative software.</span></li>
                  <li> An open source collection 
                    of modules and tools that could be shared and developed.</span></li>
                  <li> A start-up servicing the 
                    needs of the collaborative community? </span> 
                    <ul>
                      <li>Build a common platform</span></li>
                      <li>Develop the functionality 
                              and allow customizable interfaces.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p> Then there was continued discussion 
              on whether scientific researchers have significantly different 
              needs than the business/software development community. And 
              as the option of reliance on commercial tools resurfaced, 
              someone offered that commercial tools do 90% of what they 
              want, but there is no way to add the additional 10%. They 
              felt this was a long-standing dilemma.</span></p>
            <p>Tools Being Used 
              In Collaboratories</span></p>
            <ul>
              <li> A lot of client side tools, developed 
                in-house, being able to extend tools without breaking existing 
                capabilities.</span></li>
              <li> Java in UARC, HTML, in SPARC<br>
                </span></li>
              <li> More synchronous than asynchronous.</span></li>
              <li> On the back end, folks are able 
                to do a lot more with outside tools (Servlets, image processing, 
                databases). More control on the server.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Tools Which Were 
              Built But Never Used</span></p>
            <ul>
              <li> Distributed Meeting Capture System 
                - A web interface that allowed users to search meetings 
                they've been at. Required explicit actions (a new skill) 
                to set anchor/index points, not clear why anyone would want 
                to review meetings, does work well if someone is explicitly 
                tasked with creating index points (like a court recorder).</span></li>
              <li> Federal Emergency Management 
                system. The tools were only used in emergency situations, 
                and thus put too taxing a demand on people's recall, so 
                people fell back on what they knew.</span></li>
              <li> Usenet - physicists wouldn't 
                use it because it was too passive and time consuming.</span><br>
                <br>
                <a name="listOfTools"></a> </li>
