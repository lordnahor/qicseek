<H2>How to use Binary (not Text) I/O on the PC</H2>

You do not want the operating system to "help" you by automatically
converting end-of-line indicators into "standard" end-of-line indicators.
End-of-line indicators vary by platform.

<TABLE align=center>
<TR><TH>Platform</TH> <TD>&nbsp;</TD><TH>End-of-line indicator</TH>
<TR><TD>Unix</TD> <TD></TD><TD> an ASCII newline (\n) LF (linefeed) character</TD>
<TR><TD>Macintosh</TD> <TD></TD><TD> an ASCII CR (\r) (carriage return) character</TD>
<TR><TD>Windows</TD> <TD></TD><TD> an ASCII sequence CR LF (\r\n)</TD>
</TABLE>

When in text mode on Windows, if the operating system detects what would
be a normal end-of-line indicator from a different system (say, Unix),
it will convert that indicator into the two-character CR LF sequence.
Unfortunately, when dealing with binary files, this can result in an
extra byte being inserted (during input or output) which could cause
chaos.  Accordingly, unless you are dealing with files for which you do
not care if the end-of-line indicators are silently modified, you will
want to do I/O in binary mode.
<P>
This is certainly true when the input is coming from a file.
However, if input is coming from stdin
and if stdin is coming from the console keyboard
then it should not be opened in binary mode,
because that has the side effect of switching stdin into raw mode
in which all characters are read one by one with no echo,
and Ctrl-C and Ctrl-Z are disabled so you cannot signal EOF.

<PRE>
    if (filename == "") {
        fp = stdin;
#ifdef DJGPP
	if (isatty( fileno(stdin) ) == 0)
		setmode(fileno(stdin), O_BINARY);
#endif
    }
    else
        fp = fopen( filename, "rb");
    if (fp == NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr,"Cannot open file %s\n", filename);
        return(0);
    }
</PRE>
