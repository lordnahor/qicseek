409: For example, the request tries to position the resource in an ordering before or after a resource that is not in the collection.  So the conflict is with the state of the collection, not with the state of the resource identified by the request-URI.  Or the request might try to position a resource in an unordered collection.
</UL><UL>
207: For example, on an ORDERPATCH where only a single change is requested, the behavior should be analogous with PROPPATCH where only a single change to a single property is requested -- must it be a 207? 
</UL><UL>
For example, a PROPFIND or PROPPATCH on a dangling direct reference.  Must the response be 207 (Multi-Status), or could it just be a 404 (Not Found)? </UL> </P>
