<ul>
<li> Room change to DBH 4011. We'll hold lecture on Oct 13,15 at ICS 253 because DBH 4011 is booked that week.
<li> HW1 and HW2 up.
<li> Website in construction.

<p><span class="h2"> Course overview </span>
<p> Image understanding, extracting useful semantic content from image data, is a
core human competency whose emulation by machine systems has been an area
of active research in artificial intelligence for the last 40 years. Contemporary
computer vision research draws heavily from machine learning and serves as a
testing ground for new ML theories and algorithms. Computer vision in turn
provides a set of tools for many applications in multimedia information systems
and HCI, as well as the natural sciences, e.g. biomedical imaging. Graduate
students completing this course will be well prepared to comprehend current
research in computer vision or apply state-of-the-art techniques to problems of
interest in their own field.

<p><span class="h2"> Prerequisites </span>
<p> The following undergraduate courses or their equivalent: ICS 6D/Mathematics 6D, Mathematics 6G or 3A, Mathematics 2A-B, ICS 23.

<p><span class="h2"> Required course materials </span>
<ul>
<p></p><li> <em>Computer Vision, A Modern Approach</em> by Forsyth and Ponce.
</ul>

<p><span class="h2"> Recommended course materials </span>
<ul>
<p><li > <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/szeliski/Book/">Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications</a> by Szeliski. Book in progress with online draft.
<p><li> <em> Robot Vision </em> by Horn. Classic text on machine vision. Available on reserve at the Science Library. 
</ul>

<p><span class="h2"> Grading </span>
<p> 4 homeworks (with <a href="matlab.html">MATLAB</a> implementation) worth 15% each and a class project worth 40%. 

<p><span class="h2">Academic honesty</span>
<p> Homeworks can be discussed, but each student must independently write up their own solutions. In particular, no sharing of code. Please see the university policy on academic honesty. It is fine to use reference materials found online, but do not search for homework solutions. Rather, students are strongly encouraged to ask questions at both office hours and on the class discussion group. 


<p><span class="h2">Acknowledgemnts</span> 
<p>I gladly acknowledge a host of other instructors for making their teaching materials available online. A special thanks to Antonio Torralba for the nifty picture above.
