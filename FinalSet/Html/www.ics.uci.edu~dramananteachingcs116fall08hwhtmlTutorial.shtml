<h3>HTML Tutorial</h3>

<p>
(Written by David Martin) <br>
<br>
For the writeups, my only requirement is that you hand in HTML
that I can (1) view on my computer, and (2) print in a reasonable
manner.  You may use any word processor or HTML authoring software
that can generate HTML documents.  

<p>
My personal preference is simply to write the HTML using a text
editor.  For example, here is an 
<a href="template/index.html">example project writeup</a> that you 
may use as a template.

<p>
If you are just learning HTML, first print out the HTML source
for the template.  To do this, navigate to it using your browser,
and either ask the browser to "View Source" or save the page to
your computer and open it in a text editor.  The file is called
"index.html", and should begin as follows:

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body style="width:750px;"&gt;

<p>
You'll see that HTML "code" is mostly normal text, with some
formatting commands in angle brackets.  These formatting commands
are called <em>tags</em>.  For example,
the text for the page is entirely inside the 
"<tt>&lt;body>...&lt/body></tt>"
tags.  

<h4>Formatting Text</h4>

<p>
Begin every new paragraph with 
"<tt>&lt;p></tt>".  If you need to force a line break, use
"<tt>&lt;br></tt>".

<p>
In the template, you'll see that the header text for the page is within the
"<tt>&lt;h3>...&lt/h3></tt>" tags.  You can use any of the
header tags (h1,h2,...h6) to define section headers of various sizes.

<p>
To create an automatically numbered ordered list of items, use the
"<tt>&lt;ol>...&lt/ol></tt>" tags,
and begin each list item with a 
"<tt>&lt;li></tt>" tag.  You can control the type of numbers used
with a parameter to the ordered list tag, e.g. 
"<tt>&lt;ol type=a>...&lt/ol></tt>".

<h4>Displaying Images</h4>

<p>
To include an image in your writeup, use the following HTML command:

<tt><blockquote>
&lt;img src="imageName.png">
</blockquote></tt>

<p> 
where "imageName.png" is in the same directory as your "index.html" file.
If your image is in a subdirectory, then include the path:

<tt><blockquote>
&lt;img src="someSubDir/anotherSubDir/imageName.png">
</blockquote></tt>

<p>If your image is too large, then make sure to set its width (or height):

<tt><blockquote>
&lt;img width=300 src="someSubDir/anotherSubDir/imageName.png">
</blockquote></tt>

<p>If you also want to link to the original high resolution image (which
you may as well always do), then wrap the "img" tag in an hyperlink
tag:

<tt><blockquote>
&lt;a href="someSubDir/anotherSubDir/imageName.png"><br>
&lt;img width=300 src="someSubDir/anotherSubDir/imageName.png"><br>
&lt/a>
</blockquote></tt>

<h4>Special Characters</h4>

<p> 
Because HTML uses the less than sign to begin a tag, you need
to use a special command to generate a less than sign.  This command
is "<tt>&amp;lt;</tt>".

<p> 
Likewise, because HTML uses the ampersand to begin the command for
a special character like less than, use the following command
to generate an ampersand: 
"<tt>&amp;amp;</tt>".

<h4>Equations</h4>

<p> 
HTML is really bad for typsetting mathematics.  For this class,
any homework problem that requires you to write equations can be
submitted on paper.  If you want to use typeset equations, then
you have a few options.  First, you can simply use plain text,
such as MATLAB syntax.  Second, you can supplement plain text
with the few equation commands that exist in HTML (explained more below).
And third, you can generate the equations as images using some other
program.  This last option is what sites such as Mathworld use.
If you have a Mac, I recommend any of the following great little tools:
LaTeX Equation Editor, PDF Equation, or LaTeXiT.

<p>
That there are a couple of HTML
commands that help with simple equations.  Here are some examples:

<ul>

<p><li> Subscripts: "<tt>x&lt;sub>i&lt;/sub></tt>" produces x<sub>i</sub>.
<p><li> Superscripts: "<tt>x&lt;sup>2&lt;/sup></tt>" produces x<sup>2</sup>.
<p><li> Greek letters: 
"<tt>&amp;alpha;</tt>" produces &alpha;,
"<tt>&amp;beta;</tt>" produces &beta;,
"<tt>&amp;gamma;</tt>" produces &gamma;,
etc.
<p><li> Miscellaneous math symbols:
&plusmn;, &Sigma;, &Pi;, &radic;, &infin;, &int;, &le;,
&ge;, &ne;, etc.  
</ul>

<p><a

is a more comprehensive list</a> of HTML commands for both
greek letters and math symbols.

<h4>More Information</h4>

Want to learn more?  I've discussed only a few HTML commands here.
There are many more commands available, all of which you may use, and
none of which you need to use.  
The web is well populated with HTML
tutorials.  I
find <a
href="http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com">http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com</a>
to be a particularly useful reference for HTML tags.  Also check out the
course links webpage.
