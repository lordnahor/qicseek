    <h3>Example Lab Assignment</h3>
    An electron multiplier is a vacuum-tube structure that multiplies
    incident charges. At each stage of an electron multiplier, each
    electron, upon striking the plate, generates a Poisson distributed
    number of electrons for the next stage. Suppose that the mean of the
    Poisson distribution is 1.2 electrons, and assume that the process
    runs for 20 generations.<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Simulate the electron multiplier process several times,
        plotting each realization on the same plot. What is the general
        trend for this process?</li>
      <li>Simulate the process 1000 times and calculate the proportion
        of those 1000 realizations that went extinct. What probability
        is this proportion estimating?<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>What to turn into EEE Dropbox</h3>
    <p>You should turn in two files to EEE Dropbox:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>An R script file (extension .R) containing your R code (and
        comments): <a href="Hancock-ExampleLabCode.R">Hancock-ExampleLabCode.R</a><br>
      </li>
      <li>A Word (or pdf or equivalent) document containing R output and
        answers to the lab assignment questions: <a
          href="Hancock-ExampleLab.doc">Hancock-ExampleLab.doc</a><br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The Word document should be all-encompassing -- everything that
      we need to grade the assignment should be included. The R script
      file is included so we can run your R code if needed.<br>
    </p>
    <p>If you need more help using the Dropbox tool on EEE, start with
      this quick <a href="https://eee.uci.edu/clickr/?t=455&amp;f=129">Dropbox
        primer</a>. For more detailed instructions, see the <a

        Dropbox Help &amp; How To</a>.<br>
