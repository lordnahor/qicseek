Formatting instructions:
</b></p>
<p>
Abstracts must include contact information, the full list of
authors and their affiliations, and a description (100-400 words) of
the anticipated content of the paper. Full paper submissions must be
in PDF formatted for US lettersize paper. They must not exceed 10
pages (all inclusive) in standard ACM two-column conference format
(preprint mode, with page number). Templates for ACM format are
available for Microsoft Word, and LaTeX 
<a href="http://www.sigplan.org/authorInformation.htm" target="text">here</a> (use 
the 9 pt template). Over-length submissions will be summarily 
discarded by the Program Chair. 
</p>

<p><b>
Double blind review:
</b></p>
<p>
Paper submission is double-blind to reduce reviewer bias against or
for authors or institutions. Thus, the submissions cannot include
author names, institutions or hints based on references to prior
work. If authors are extending their own work, they need to reference
and discuss the past work in third person, as if they were extending
someone else's research. We realize that for some papers it will still
reveal authorship, but as long as an effort was made to follow these
guidelines, the submission will not be penalized. Authors must
identify any conflicts-of-interest with PC members and external
review committee members, as defined <a href="http://www.sigplan.org/review_policies.htm" target="text">
here</a> (ACM SIGPLAN policy).
</p>

<p><b>
Poster submission:
</b></p>
<p>
Poster submissions must conform to the same format restrictions, but
may not exceed 2 pages in length. Paper submissions that are not
accepted for regular presentations will automatically be considered
for posters; authors who do not want their paper considered for the
poster session should indicate this in their abstract
submission. Two-page summaries of posters will be included in the
conference proceedings.
