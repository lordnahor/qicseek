<p>Everything we set out to do in the beginning now works. We have fully implemented the building finder, tour, augmented reality, and user upload portions of our app. The user can essentially navigate to any portion of our app and be able to do what it says. We were able to finish our last bit of functionality thanks to the extreme perseverance of Kevin. Our app looks really cool and we really believe that everything is working how we wanted it to. Granted, there were times in the beginning where some things, namely augmented reality and user uploads, that seemed not possible to do in a week, be we managed to power through and Learn UCI (LUCI [lucy, get it?]) is ready for tomorrow!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>In light of being done, I would personally like to add some memes that helped us get through appjam week:</p>

<p>App Update:<br />
Today we made a lot of progress in getting our app&#8217;s components to work together. In the beginning of the week when we threw around ideas and planned out our app, we all had our own goals and visions of what we would eventually make. As of tonight, the primary functionality of our app is finished, some of which we did not even anticipate having time to implement. While there are still a few aspects of our app which we are tweaking and/or trying to implement, here is what we have done so far:</p>
<p>Implemented:<br />
&#8211;Google Maps<br />
&#8211;Text to speech<br />
&#8211;Search Functionality<br />
&#8211;User Uploads<br />
&#8211;Personal Profiles</p>
<p>Challenges:<br />
Now that we are satisfied with our app, our main focus is on the presentation. We still lots to do and we are working hard to not slow down and continue to look for ways to improve our app and find creative ways we can present on Tuesday. One of the biggest challenges we faced this week were implementing and GUI without the use of a 3rd party API. However, after much hard work and deliberation over design styles, we are all happy with our result. Hopefully all goes well tomorrow.</p>

<p>Our app is nearing completion. Now we are just putting some finishing touches on it. It&#8217;s been a little hard to get the team to all meet up at once, but we&#8217;ve all been doing our parts and everything is stitching together perfectly. In terms of functionality, our app works. Now we are trying to rework the database so that it is a more scale-able design. Our app also looks very nice as well. The menu screens all look very sleek and windows-phone esque even though we made it in android. Tomorrow is just fine tuning, finishing the database reorganization, and working out how the presentation and display will work. Hopefully by Monday, we&#8217;ll have little to panic about.</p>

<p>Our app is making headway. One or two more dedicated days of work and we should be finished with all of our requirements. We hope to test on Sunday and throw together a presentation on Monday. Many of our problems that we have been working on over the week are beginning to be resolved and we finally got our SVN to work smoothly and integrate with Eclipse. Before now, it was just a mess of conflicts that made our computers sad. As we are making our app, we are also keeping design and graphics in mind. Hopefully, when we display our app, we&#8217;ll have an app that works well and is graphically pleasing.</p>

<p>Current Progress status:<br />
Today most of our team assembled in the ICS building at around 7:30, although some of the team members have been working on some of the current goals before then. Things are running smoothly in terms of completing one task after another, the problem is there are still many tasks to complete&#8230;</p>
<p>Progress Today:<br />
The core functionality of our app that we have been working on since the second day has become much more polished and is near completion. There is still a lot to be done in terms of bringing the app together using the functionality that we have created into a product.</p>
<p>Challenges:<br />
Although we have not hit any major roadblocks in terms of completing the tasks, I think that many of us have been underestimating the amount of tasks that this app will require before it is fully complete. We may need to do a better job of planning out what needs to happen each day so that we can have everything that we want and still finish before Monday comes.</p>

We have begun coding the major parts of our app. Today we started working on the user interface, implemented google maps, and uploading data to mySLQ.</p>

Although we have made a lot of progress implementing the individual components of our app, we need to start integrating as a system.</p>

<p>Current Progress Status:</p>
<p>Today we were not able to meet up as a team until around 6:30 p.m. tonight. There was some confusion on where we would be meeting so finding one another was a little more difficult than necessary. Once we all got together and started working, things went very smoothly. Since we mutually decided upon an idea last night, we already had a general idea of what needed to happen today.</p>
<p>So far we have created our home screen layout, collected some of the data that we will need in our app, and uploaded that data to the database. We will continue working tonight to get as much progress done as we can tonight and try and establish some goals for tomorrow.</p>
<p>Challenges:<br />
Since everything is still very basic in terms of the current tasks, we have not been faced with too many challenges today. However, I am sure there will be great challenges to overcome in the near future&#8230;</p>
