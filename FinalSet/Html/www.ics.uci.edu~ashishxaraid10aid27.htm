The United Nations is sending special teams to Asia to help after the Tsunami disaster which the head of Unicef said Sunday had wielded ?staggering? power. ?UN disaster assessment and coordination teams are being dispatched throughout the region to work with governments of affected countries in providing rescue and relief assistance,? said a spokesman for UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Governments and humanitarian organisations around the world scrambled to offer aid and technical help Sunday after the devastating quake and tidal waves that killed thousands of people in southern Asia.
