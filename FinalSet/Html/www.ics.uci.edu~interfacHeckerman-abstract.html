For the last eight years, I have been working with a team at Microsoft
to develop principles, methods, and technology for data mining.  Some
of this technology now appears in Micrsoft products including SQL
Server 2000 and Commerce Server 2000.  Our research has covered
several important aspects of data mining including exploratory data
analysis, large-scale data analysis, automated data analysis, causal
discovery, and the integration of data analysis and data storage.
Several classes of statistical models including graphical models and
mixtures models have played an important role.  In my talk, I will
describe our research and demonstrate our technology using real
examples from web mining and ecommerce.
