<P>
Offered jointly with 
<A HREF="http://www.eng.uci.edu/">The Henry Samueli School of Engineering</A>, 
the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) major provides a unique educational opportunity for students interested in 
learning about both the hardware and software aspects of computers, and the application of computers to real-world 
problems. CSE includes methods of organizing and manipulating information (computer science), as 
well as the design of computers and their components (computer engineering). As such, CSE integrates 
interesting topics in computing devices, networks, software and systems engineering.
<P>
CSE graduates are well-positioned for career opportunities in both academia and industry. Our alumni are employed at 
leading companies or continue their studies toward M.S. or Ph.D. degrees at prestigious 
universities.

Embedded devices increasingly drive innovation in consumer goods and products, and often are used in large quantities 
to form sensor networks that monitor the weather, environment, or physical structures. Students interested in 
learning how such devices are designed and constructed are encouraged to explore the CSE major.
<P>
Graduates of the program will:
<ul class="content-list-large">
   <LI>demonstrate broad knowledge of computer science and engineering;
   <LI>design, describe and use state-of-the-art hardware/software systems;
   <LI>maintain awareness of contemporary issues in computer science and engineering in a global and societal context, 
       and an understanding of the professional and ethical responsibilities of their profession;

To better help students plan their upcoming quarters, following is a list of approved science elective courses for satisfying the CSE major's science elective requirement:
   <ul class="content-list-large" STYLE="margin-bottom: 2em; ">
      <LI>Biological Sciences. All Biological Sciences courses except those numbered 1-93, 142 and 189-199 are pre-approved science electives.
      <LI>Chemistry. All Chemistry courses except those numbered 1P, 5, H90 and 190-199 are pre-approved science electives.

      <LI>The science elective must be taken at UCI if the student is currently enrolled at UCI. 
      <LI>The material covered in the course cannot substantially repeat the material covered in the Computer Science and Engineering core courses (e.g., a computing for physics majors course from the Department of Physics and Astronomy would not be approved.)
      <LI>Courses should primarily focus on understanding or applying scientific principles (e.g., a writing course offered by the School of Biological Sciences that mainly focuses on writing would not be approved.) 
   </UL>

<P>
<STRONG>CSE Track Courses</STRONG><BR>

<p>
Computer Science and Engineering majors are involved in building hardware infrastructure — computers, networks and embedded devices — as well as operating systems, compilers and networking software. The focus is on cooperation between hardware and software to yield the highest performance. 
<P>
Graduates of the CSE program at UCI can pursue careers that involve traffic management, flight control, earthquake monitoring, automotive control and building smart homes. Many students also go on to graduate school, continuing their studies, conducting research and earning advanced degrees in computer engineering, computer science, information science, management or law.

UC Irvine offers several ways to add depth scope, and experiential learning to your academic program of study. An academic counselor will help you determine the most efficient way to add another major, a minor or concentration to your academic plan, and will refer you to other campus programs and resources that support your interests and future goals. All Bren School majors in good standing may propose an academic plan that demonstrates the ability to complete the concentration and other requirements for graduation in a reasonable timeframe.

<UL class="content-list-large">
   
   <LI><STRONG>CONCENTRATION: Engineering and Computer Science in the Global Context. </STRONG>
       The globalization of the marketplace for information technology services and products makes it likely that Bren School graduates will work in multicultural settings or be employed by companies with extensive international operations or customer bases. The goal of the concentration is to help students develop and integrate knowledge of the history, language and culture of a country or geographic region outside the United States, through coursework both at UCI and an international host campus, followed by a technology related internship in the host country. 
       <P CLASS="sub-indent">
          <P><STRONG>Application:</STRONG><BR>
             Each student’s proposed program of study, specifying coursework and a guided internship experience in a region outside the U.S. must be approved in advance by the Bren School’s Associate Dean for Student Affairs. It is expected that each student’s proposal will reflect a high degree of planning that includes the guidance of academic counselors and those at the UCI Center for International Education regarding course selection, as well as considerations related to internship opportunities, housing and financial aid. The academic counselors and the Associate Dean will be available to assist qualified students with the development of a satisfactory academic plan, as needed.
      <P><STRONG>Requirements:</STRONG> <BR>
             <UL CLASS="sub-indent">
             <LI>A minimum of eight courses at UCI or at the international campus with an emphasis on the culture, language (if applicable and necessary), history, literature of the country that corresponds to the international portion of the program, international law, international labor policy, global issues, global institutions, global conflict and negotiation, and global economics;  </LI>
             <LI>A one- or two-semester sequence of technical courses related to the major and, possibly, cultural, history and literature courses taken at an international university; </LI>
             <LI>A two-month or longer technical internship experience in the same country as the international educational experience. </LI>
              </UL>
       </P>

   <LI><STRONG>Bren School Honors Program.</STRONG>       Allows juniors and seniors enrolled in Bren School major (Biomedical Computing, Business Information Management, 
      Computer Game Science, Computer Science, Computer Science and Engineering, Informatics, Information and Computer 
      Science, or Software Engineering) to pursue advanced work in one of many research areas. Students who join the 
      program participate in an honors seminar, conduct independent research under the guidance of a faculty member, 
      and write a research paper.
