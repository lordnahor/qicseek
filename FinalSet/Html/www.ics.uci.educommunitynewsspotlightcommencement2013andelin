<p>
Good morning graduates, parents, friends and family. This is a memorable day for you and those who are here to support you. I am honored to be here today, too, and to share this important day. My name is Roger Andelin. I was here, in your shoes, two days and 26 years ago. It was a beautiful, sunny June day. We were outside on the grass then. It was also my birthday. My parents were here, like many of yours, and so was my girlfriend. She was a bio major. I thought it was a good match: ICS and bio. In some abstract but tangible way it seemed to go together. We found a lot of common ground. I would explain to her how a computer virus worked, and she would explain to me how a biological virus worked. She would teach me about a string of DNA code and cells, and I would teach her about programming objects and interpreters. We mused at the similarities: white blood cells vs. anti-virus software, neurotransmitters vs. networks, short-term memory vs. RAM. Who could have imagined such a pleasant interaction with a bio major?  Well, next month, that bio major and I will celebrate our 26th anniversary!
</p>
<p>
My adult life started right here on this campus. Like many of you, I walked the campus moving quickly to and from classes. I stressed about my classes, my professors and my exams, but I also thought about the brightness of the future. It was the mid-80s. Technology majors were in demand. A huge shift was underway, like now! PCs were taking over. Computing power was moving to the desktop. New software was coming out; new hardware was coming out. Think about how much has changed since then! It has been very exciting. Now, think about how much it will change during your careers. You will be very fortunate to experience some great things. You are entering an industry segment that is relevant. There is so much more to do and to discover with faster computers, more data and better software. I can&#8217;t think of a better place to be. Congratulations on a wise choice.  
</p>
<p>
The technology ecosystem is more interesting today than it was when I graduated. So many new and exciting things are happening. I know you know about them, but let me mention a few. Big data: I can&#8217;t wait to see what you will discover when you combine unimaginable computing power with unimaginable amounts of data and ingenious software. It will be like exploring &#8220;data&#8221; outer space or the bottom of the ocean for the first time. It is going to expand human knowledge in meaningful ways. Cyber Security: Powerful malware is already present in our networks, opening doors for cyber thieves.  The equivalent of dangerous, dark alleys are popping up all over cyberspace. Companies are now considering the ethics and legality of defending themselves proactively. Anyone jumping into this segment of computing can expect an exciting and lucrative career. Even bigger, we are going through a major technology shift right now! The days of the desktop PC are numbered. Much like the mainframe was 25 years ago, 2011 may have been the pinnacle of desktop rule. Tablets with touch screen will soon rule. They are growing so fast right now; they will pass PC/laptop shipments by 2015. This is a huge shift! I think it will be more disruptive than anything I have experienced in the past 25 years. It will touch so many more people. New software, hardware and networks are going to quickly evolve. You are on the early edge of this change. What could be more interesting? What career could offer more? I am excited for you!
</p>
<p>
Like nothing before, you will also be able to collaborate with others all over the world. Your endless hours of multi-player gaming are finally going to pay off. It is nearly seamless for you to collaborate with other developers anywhere in the world on a project rapidly, without latency. I don&#8217;t know of any other profession that is quite like this. You can be effective working in teams anywhere in the world, around the clock, collaborating with chat, Jira and other tools. Speaking of teams, when you find people you like to work with, invest in that, stick together, and work together. Teams are more powerful than individuals. There is a powerful principle here: The team is the most important &#8220;object&#8217; in the workplace, and it is going to replace the current functional department soon. Invest in building your team!  
</p>
<p>
Lastly, I want you to keep in mind that you speak a foreign language. Really! You need to be aware that not everyone understands this language. Take time to explain technical details in a way that others can understand. This is the one skill that has been most helpful to me working at the &#8216;C&#8217; level. Also, and more importantly, we need more technologists in &#8216;C&#8217; level positions. Why? Because you can do great things there. For example, in the 90s, office suite software and technology were given credit for huge productivity gains that fueled an economic turnaround, eliminated the national debt and created a budget surplus. Imagine that? Technology has the potential to do even more to improve the human condition worldwide. When you combine your technology skills with an understanding of business and social drivers, you have amazing potential to innovate and solve problems. I want you to use that potential! I want to wish you all the best of luck for a bright future. Congratulations.
