	The goal of research is to develop breakthrough technologies that radically improve performance of various networks by delving into the subject of research and extracting its essential aspects, which are modeled based on various mathematical theories including graph theory, optimization theory, algorithm design theory, and optimization theory. In order to establish the models, we have particularly integrated tie-set graph theory, which is a principle Kirchhoff’s theory that has played a significant role in the field of circuits and power systems. The tie-set graph creates independent logical loop structure in an underlying graph of the network; each loop can be seen as a tie-set representing a set of all edges comprising a loop. The set of loops (tie-sets) forms a linear vector space in the network, and thus the complexity of a target network can be significantly reduced. On the basis of tie-set graph theory, a variety of decentralized architectures have been developed to realize global optimization of an entire network with iterative local autonomous distributed control based on individual tie-sets.
	<!-- We currently study and develop distributed architectures on the basis of graph theory especially focusing on loop structure (tie-sets) in order to realize theoretically optimal autonomous local controls in grid computing and information communication networks. A set of loops uniquely determined by tree structure of network topologies is called a fundamental system of tie-sets, which consists of &mu;(G) independent loops where &mu;(G) is a nullity of a underlying graph of a network or grid. If a node in a network recognizes fundamental tie-sets to which the node belongs, optimal network management in power flow control, failure recovery, traffic engineering, Openflow, among others, can be realized on the basis of a &mu;(G) dimensional linear vector space defined by the tie-sets. Furthermore, we are now developing theories and techniques for various systems of the next generation Smart Grid. -->

	Future smart grids will likely support bi-directional flow of electricity and include power production from multiple, disparate and uncontrollable sources due to a high penetration of distributed renewable energy resources. Some of the more challenging problems for the future grid include maximizing the use and efficiency of renewable resources, and realizing optimal demand and power production responses that can complement renewable intermittency. Integration of renewables together with energy storage systems has been motivated by the increasing attention to feature renewable energies from not only solar and wind power but also the excess generation from many customers. Effective use of renewable resources using battery systems can be realized by balanced transmission and distribution of such distributed resources with complementary demand and dispatchable generation responses. The spatial distribution, intermittency and uncontrollability of most renewable resources, however, make stable and reliable electricity transmission and distribution difficult especially with high renewable market penetration in large-scale complex power networks. For this reason, we develop an autonomous distributed architecture that can realize optimum allocation of complementary demand and power response together with dispersed renewable energy resources to produce highly efficient and reliable operation of future power networks that will integrate millions of state-of-the-art real-time end-use devices.
	<!-- We develop a novel distributed control model to distribute renewable energy resources to consumers in a future large-scale power grid connecting real-time end-use devices to anticipate demand and renewable generation automatically. The proposed technique, which integrates tie-set graph theory with an intelligent agent system, effectively divides the power grid into a set of loops, which are called tie-sets. Autonomous agents constantly navigate the grid to dynamically synchronize state information among tie-sets and completely automate the power network. We also deal with a power flow loss minimization problem and an optimal power flow model to effectively integrate energy storage systems. -->

	<LI><font size="4"><a href= "TBFT.pdf" target="_blank">Fault Tolerant Network</a></font></LI>
	From a topological perspective, network failure happens when a link between two nodes ceases to properly deliver messages and/or a node just goes down. Such a failure may cause connections to be dropped or result in nodes having inconsistent state information, which may in turn paralyze the whole system. While a failure can easily disrupt a centralized system, a properly designed distributed system can tolerate such partial failures and continue normal operations. Such a system is referred to as fault tolerant. Failure events are likely to transpire during geographically correlated physical phenomena such as natural disasters (e.g. earthquakes), cosmic events (e.g. solar storms), and deliberate attacks (e.g. low-altitude nuclear detonations). We propose a mechanism for coping with link failures in an autonomous and distributed manner. We call it Tie-set Based Fault Tolerance (TBFT) because it utilizes tie-sets, which represent a set of the edges comprising a loop within the graph that represents the network. An autonomous distributed control method based on dividing a network into a set of tie-sets, whose union covers every edge in the network, has been verified to be more effective than traditional tree-based restoration techniques in case of single and double link failures.

	<LI><font size="4">Network Traffic Engineering</font></LI>
	Network flow problems have been studied for a long time since the birth of graph and network theory as in a maximum flow problem with given capacities of a network. In the domain of traffic engineering, there are many heuristic approaches in an attempt to resolve network traffic congestion, and many techniques have tried to redirect network flows by path-based distributed computation methods. While those schemes with distributed computing have been used to achieve an efficient traffic allocation to improve total throughput in a network, distributing network flows to several paths has not become a radical solution to optimize network flows. In the field of circuits and power systems, the Kirchhoff’s theory has been integrated to optimize power flows as well as design fault-tolerant reliable systems even in a complicated non-planar meshed topology. Bridging the gap between the Kirchhoff’s theoretical basis and complexity in communication systems must lead to breakthrough in performance improvement of network systems applications giving an enough motivation to overcome this challenge.

	Circuit theory and circuit-based computation have contributed to designing efficient, highly-scalable, and reliable distributed control systems. Since the birth of Kirchhoffs voltage and current laws, graph and circuit theory has played an important role in designing efficient and reliable circuit systems, even for a network with a complicated non-planar graph. Beyond the area of circuit systems, the theory of circuits has contributed to designing distributed networks for simplified and operation as in pre-configured cycle (p-Cycle) protection in information networks. These days, attention has been focused on mesh topologies because of the flexibility, efficiency, and resiliency they provide, and their familiarity through similarity with the information networks that form the Internet. Further development and verification of circuit theory is therefore inevitably important for the design of sophisticated circuit, network, and power systems in many fields. In the project, we analyze the property of circuit-based computations with a graph theorybased verification and develop circuit theories to be applied to many a variety of research fields.
