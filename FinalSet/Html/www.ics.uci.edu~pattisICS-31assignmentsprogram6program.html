<td width ="80%">
This programming assignment is designed to ensure that you know how to use
  combinations of Python's most important data types to model and
  compactly write code that solves a few different programming problems.
The kind of abstract thinking that goes into modeling solutions to these
  programming problems, with these data types (and iteration over them), is
  critical to your development as programmers.
<p>
There are two parts to this assignment.
In each you will be asked to write a module that contains a few functions
  and a script at the bottom, which ties these functions together to solve
  the problem.
<p>
You should download the 
  <a href="program6.zip">program6</a> project folder and use it to create an
  Eclipse project.
You will create each module in this project, and submit each module
  separately in Checkmate.
The project folder contains no modules, but it does contain all the data files
  you need to test/debug you modules.
<p>
<b>Only one student should submit all parts of the the assignment</b>, but both
  student's names should appear in the comments at the top of
  <b>each submitted .py</b> file.
It should look something like
<pre><b>
# Romeo Montague, Lab 1
# Juliet Capulet, Lab 1
# We certify that we worked cooperatively on this programming
#   assignment, according to the rules for pair programming</b></pre>
Please turn in each program <b>as you finish it</b>, so that I can accurately
  assess the progress of the class as a whole during this assignment.
<p>
Print this document and carefully read it, marking any parts that contain
  important detailed information that you find (for review before you turn in
  the files).
The code you write should be as compact and elegant as possible, using 
  appropriate Python idioms.
<p>
You can use either <b>dict</b> or <b>defaultdict</b>, and you will need to use
  <b>split</b> to convert a string you read from a file into a list of names.
  Although the example strings are all one-character, your code should work for
  any length strings.
<p>
You should familiarize yourselves with the <b>safe_open</b> function in the
  <b>goody</b> module and all the functions in the <b>prompt</b> module, both
  of which you should have installed in your <b>courselib</b> folder as part
  of the Eclipse/Python installation.
Recall how to use the <b>sep</b> and <b>end</b> parameters in the <b>print</b>
  function.
Finally, reread the section on <b>Time Management</b> from Programming
  Assignment 0 before starting this assignment.

<td width ="20%"><b>Problem #1: Reachability</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
<h3>Problem Summary:</h3>
<ul>
<li> Write a script that prompts the user to enter the name of
  a file representing a graph.
<li>Read the information in the file, storing the graph in a dictionary.
<li>Print the graph.
<li>Repeatedly prompt the user for a starting node in the graph, and compute and
      print all the nodes that are reachable from it by following edges in the
      graph.
</ul>
<h3>Input and Output</h3>
Read a file of pairs of node names (representing edges) in a directed
  graph, building a <b>dict</b> whose key is a <b>str</b> source node and whose
  value is a <b>set</b> of <b>str</b> destination nodes that are each
  reachable from the source node key.
We write this annotation as <b>{str : {str}}</b>
<p>
Two nodes appear on each line: first the source node, then the destination
  node, with these node names separated by one semicolon character.
For example, the input file <b>graph1.txt</b> contains the following
  lines (which could appear in this order, or any other):
<b><pre>  c;f
  b;d
  a;c
  c;e
  d;g
  a;b
  e;d
  f;g
  f;d</pre></b>
which represent the graph
<p>
<image src="images/graph.gif">
<p>
Print the graph, one source node per line (the source nodes are printed
  alphabetically) followed by the set of all the destination nodes that the
  source can immediately reach.
The graph above would print as
<b><pre>  Graph: source -> {destination} nodes
     a -> {'c', 'b'}
     b -> {'d'}
     c -> {'f', 'e'}
     d -> {'g'}
     e -> {'d'}
     f -> {'g', 'd'}</pre></b>
<p>
Note that the source nodes are <b>sorted</b> alphabetically, but the <b>set</b>
   of desintation nodes does <b>not have to be sorted</b>:
  in fact it makes no sense to talk about sorted <b>sets</b>; we could talk
  about a sorted <b>list</b> whose contents came from a <b>set</b>.
Note that because node <b>g</b> is not a source node (it is only a
  destination node), it does not appear first on any line (and appears only
  in the <b>sets</b> for source nodes <b>d</b> and <b>f</b>.
<p>
Note that there are multiple data files for this program: <b>graph1.txt</b>,
  <b>graph2.txt</b> and <b>graph3.txt</b>; test/debug your program on 
  the first file; when you are done, test it on the last two.
Draw the graph represented by each for to ensure that your code correctly
  prints it and computes the nodes reachable from any source node (which you
  can do by eyeballing the graphs: they are small).
<p>
Repeatedly prompt the user for a starting node in the graph (until <b>quit</b>
  is entered) and compute and print all the nodes that are reachable from it by
  following edges in the graph.
Reject any node not present in the graph.
An example interaction (processing the graph above) might be
<b><pre>  Enter starting node: e
  From e the reachable nodes are {'g', 'e', 'd'}

  Enter starting node: a
  From a the reachable nodes are {'g', 'f', 'e', 'd', 'c', 'b', 'a'}

  Enter starting node: quit</pre></b>
<h3>Functions and Script</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>read_graph</b> has an open (file) parameter; it returns the <b>dict</b>
     representing the graph
    (mine is 9 lines).
<li><b>print_graph</b> has a <b>dict</b> parameter (representing the graph); it
    returns nothing, but it prints the graph in the appropriate form
     (mine is 4 lines).
<li><b>reachable</b> has a <b>dict</b> parameter (representing the graph) and
    a <b>str</b> start node in the graph (technically a key in the <b>dict</b>;
    it returns a <b>set</b> of all the nodes reachable from it by following
    edges in the graph
   (mine is 9 lines).
<li>Write a script at the bottom of this module that calls these functions
   to solve the problem
   (mine is 7 lines).
<p>
I am supplying these number of lines not as requirements, but ballpark estimate
  of the amount of code you should write.
<p>
Here is the basic algorithm for computing reachability; it is simple to explain
  and not (very) complicated to implement.
But, you have to understand these instructions and carefully translate them into
  Python.
You should hand-simulate this algorithm using the graph above, and verify that
  it produces the results you expect before coding it.
If you know what recursion is, you might be tempted to use it; but please
  don't: unless recursion is done very carefully, it will run forever on graphs
  with cycles: one of the input files is a graph with cycles.
<ol>
<li>To compute all the reachable nodes in a graph, create a <b>set</b>
   (initially empty) of reached nodes and a <b>list</b> (initially containing
   the  parameter start node) of nodes that we are going to explore (to find
   nodes they can reach).
<p>
<li>While the <b>exploring list</b> still has nodes, remove the first one
    (recall the <b>pop</b> method for lists) and put it into the
    <b>reached set</b>; for all its destination nodes that are not
   already in the <b>reached set</b>, put them in the <b>exploring list</b>.
<p>
<li>When the <b>exploring list</b> becomes empty (can you argue that this always
    will happen -there is no infinite looping), return the <b>reached set</b>.
</ol>
<p>
Print the set containing all these node labels.
When debugging this algorithm, print the <b>set</b> and <b>list</b> after every
  interesting change, or use the debugger to see how these change.
</ul>
<h3>Sample Interaction</h3>
The program, as specified, will have the following interaction:
  user-typed information appears in <i>italics</i>.
Your output should "match" this one (sets will match if they have the same
  contents, independent of their order).
You should also check that it works for other starting nodes, and
  a variety of starting nodes in the other graphs.

<b><pre>  Enter file name with graph: <i>graph1.txt</i>

  Graph: source -> {destination} nodes
    a -> {'c', 'b'}
    b -> {'d'}
    c -> {'f', 'e'}
    d -> {'g'}
    e -> {'d'}
    f -> {'g', 'd'}

  Enter starting node: <i>e</i>
  From e the reachable nodes are {'g', 'e', 'd'}

  Enter starting node: x
    Entry Error: 'x';  Not a source node
    Please enter a legal String

  Enter starting node: <i>a</i>
  From a the reachable nodes are {'g', 'f', 'e', 'd', 'c', 'b', 'a'}

  Enter starting node: quit</pre></b>

<td width ="20%"><b>Problem #2: Instant Runoff Voting</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
<h3>Problem Summary:</h3>
<ul>
<li> Write a script that prompts the user to enter the name of
       a file representing the preference of a sequence of voters.
<li>Read the information in the file, storing it in a dictionary.
<li>Print the voter preference.
<li>Repeatedly display the vote count for ballots (sorted both by candidate
      and numerically), eliminating from the election the candidate receiving
      the fewest votes, until one candidate (the winner) or no candidates
      (a tie) remain.
</ul>
This form of election is known as <b>instant runoff voting</b>.
Every voter submits a ballot that ranks all the candidates the election, from
  from most favorite candidate to least favorite (we will use a <b>list</b>
  for this purpose</b>: earlier in the list means more favored).
<p>
During the first ballot, votes are counted for each of the candidates according
  to the rankings of the voters.
Then the candidate(s) with the fewest number of votes are removed from the
  election: if more than one candidate receives the least number of votes, they
  all are removed from the election.
<p>
During the second ballot, votes are tallied for the <b>remaining candidates</b>
  (there are at least 1 fewer candidates); if a voter's first ranked candidate
  is still in the election, then that candidate should receive the vote; if a
  voter's first ranked candidate is not still in the election, then his/her
  second ranked candidate should receive the vote; but if his/her second ranked
  cnadidate has been removed from the election, then his/her third ranked
  candidate should receive the vote ...).
<p>
This ballot process continues until either 1 candidate remains, or 0 candidates
  remain (meaning that all the previous candidates tallied the same number
  of votes and therefore were all removed).
<h3>Input and Output</h3>
Read a file of voters and their ranking of the candidates, separated
  by semicolons, building a <b>dict</b> whose key is each voter and whose
  value is a list of candidates ranked by that voter (they appear in the
  file in order, from most favorite to least favorit)
We write this annotation as <b>{str : [str]}</b>
<p>

For example, the input file <b>votepref1.txt</b> contains the following
  lines (which could appear in this order, or any other):
<b><pre>  A;X;Y;Z
  B;Y;Z;X
  C;Y;Z;X
  D;Z;Y;X
  E;Z;Y;X</pre></b>
The first line means, voter <b>A</b> ranks candidate <b>X</b> first,
  candidate <b>Y</b> second, and candidate <b>Z</b> third.
The second line means, voter <b>B</b> ranks candidate <b>Y</b> first,
  candidate <b>Z</b> second, and candidate <b>X</b> third.
Each line will have a unique voter and a permutation of all the 
  candidates running.
<p>
Print all the associations in this <b>dict</b>, one per line (the voters are
  printed alphabetically) using the following form.
Each line contains the voter and his/her complete ranking of the candidates.
For example, the file above would produce:
<b><pre>  Voter Preferences
     A  ->  ['X', 'Y', 'Z']
     B  ->  ['Y', 'Z', 'X']
     C  ->  ['Y', 'Z', 'X']
     D  ->  ['Z', 'Y', 'X']
     E  ->  ['Z', 'Y', 'X']</pre></b>
<p>
Note that the voter names are <b>sorted</b> alphabetically, but the <b>list</b>
  of preference appear the same order they appeared in the file.
There are multiple data files for this program: <b>votepref1.txt</b>, 
  <b>votepref2.txt</b> and <b>votepref3.txt</b>; test/debug your program on the
  first file; when you are done, test it on the rest.
<p>
Start with all the candidates.
Evaluate the ballot to determine how many votes each candidate received.
Print this vote count two ways: sorted alphabetically and sorted numerically
  (in decreasing order).
Remove the candidate(s) receiving the fewest votes, and repeat this process
  until only one or no candidates remain.
Finally, print the outcome of the election: a single candidate winner or a tie.
An example interaction (processing the graph above) might be
<b><pre>  Vote count on ballot #1 with candidates (alphabetically) = {'X', 'Y', 'Z'}
    X  ->  1
    Y  ->  2
    Z  ->  2

  Vote count on ballot #1 with candidates (numerical) = {'Y', 'X', 'Z'}
    Y  ->  2
    Z  ->  2
    X  ->  1

  Vote count on ballot #2 with candidates (alphabetically) = {'Y', 'Z'}
    Y  ->  3
    Z  ->  2

  Vote count on ballot #2 with candidates (numerical) = {'Y', 'Z'}
    Y  ->  3
    Z  ->  2

  Winner is  {'Y'}</pre></b>
The first ballot consisted of all three candidates, <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>, 
  and <b>Z</b> (printed in the set after the <b>=</b>).
For this ballot, the votes were counted and printed; candidate <b>X</b>
  received the fewest number of votes so is eliminated from the next ballot.
The second ballot consisted of two candidates, <b>Y</b> and <b>Z</b>
  (printed in the set after the <b>=</b>).
For this ballot, the votes were counted and printed; candidate <b>Z</b>
  received the fewest number of votes so is eliminated from the next ballot.
There is only one candidate remaining so <b>Y</b> is declared the winner.
An alternative outcome might be
<b>No winner: election is a tie among candidates remaining on the ballot</b>
<p>
If you have any questions about how instant runoff voting works (these rules are
  a bit subtle), please post questions on the forum; you can include examples
 and what-if questions as long as you don't write code.

<h3>Functions and Script</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>print_dict</b> has a <b>str</b> title, any kind of <b>dict</b>, a
      <b>function</b>(default <b>None</b>) and <b>bool</b> (default
      <b>False</b>)as parameters and returns nothing; but it
      prints the title followed by the dictionary in the appropriate form and
      order (specified  by the function and <b>bool</b>).
    The function determines the ordering and the <b>bool</b> determines whether
      to reverse it: like the <b>key</b> and <b>reverse</b> parameters used to
      sort in Python.
    This function is used to print both the voter preference <b>dict</b> and
      the vote count <b>dict</b> for each ballot
     (mine is 4 lines).
<li><b>read_voter_preferences</b> has an open (file) parameter; it returns the
       <b>dict</b> representing each voter and his/her preferences: 
       <b>{str : [str]}</b>
      (mine is 6 lines).
<li><b>evaluate_ballot</b> has a <b>dict</b> of voter preference 
         (<b>{str : [str]}</b> read above) and a
         <b>set</b> of the remaining candidates as parameters; it returns
         a dictionary whose keys are these candidates and whose values are the
         number of votes they received on this ballot, based on the description
         of <b>instant runnoff voting</b>:
         <b>{str : int}</b>.
       Remember to count <b>only one vote</b> per voter (hint: you might have
          to <b>break</b> out of a loop), for his/her highest
         ranked candidate stil in the election 
      (mine is 8 lines - I used a comprehension in this code).
<li><b>remaining_candidates</b> has a <b>dict</b> as a parameter whose keys are
          candidates and whose values are the number of votes they received
          (<b>{str : int}</b>); it returns a set containing all those
          candidates remaining in the election (the one(s) receiving the
          fewest number of votes are absent).
       Note that if all the candidates receive the same number of votes, then
         this function returns an empty <b>set</b>.
       (mine is 3 lines - I used a comprehension in this code).
<li>Write a script at the bottom of this module the calls these functions
   to solve the problem
   (mine is 13 lines).
</ul>
<h3>Sample Interaction</h3>
The program, as specified, will have the following interaction:
  user-typed information appears in <i>italics</i>.
Your output should match this one.
<pre><b>  Enter file with voter preferences: <i>votepref1.txt</i>

  Voter Preferences
    A  ->  ['X', 'Y', 'Z']
    B  ->  ['Y', 'Z', 'X']
    C  ->  ['Y', 'Z', 'X']
    D  ->  ['Z', 'Y', 'X']
    E  ->  ['Z', 'Y', 'X']
  
  Vote count on ballot #1 with candidates (alphabetically) = {'Z', 'Y', 'X'}
    X  ->  1
    Y  ->  2
    Z  ->  2

  Vote count on ballot #1 with candidates (numerical) = {'Y', 'X', 'Z'}
    Y  ->  2
    Z  ->  2
    X  ->  1

  Vote count on ballot #2 with candidates (alphabetically) = {'Y', 'Z'}
    Y  ->  3
    Z  ->  2

  Vote count on ballot #2 with candidates (numerical) = {'Y', 'Z'}
    Y  ->  3
    Z  ->  2

  Winner is  {'Y'}</b></pre>
<p>
You can also try processing the <b>votepref2.txt</b> file (which leads to
  a <b>No winner</b> result) and <b>votepref3.text</b>.
