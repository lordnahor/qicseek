the Wikipedia community, perhaps equal in importance to writing
articles. You will edit your assignments in groups of two. Take a
couple of minutes to identify each other. We will help form groups if
necessary. Write your name on this review sheet, answer the questions,
and give it to your partner. Also write your name on your partner's
draft, as you will be making direct edits to it. Your partner will
hand in both the draft and the review sheet with their final draft.

<p></p><li> Does the article avoid jargon or vague wording, and instead read as consise and clear?
<p></p><li> Does the article define acronyms and abbreviations at their first occurence?
<p></p><li> Does the article make proper use of italics and bold text for emphasis?
</ul>

<p> Read it again, more carefully, answering the questions below on
this sheet, as well as making comments in the margin of the paper as necessary.
