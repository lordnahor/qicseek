<LI><A NAME="QQ1"><B>How do you get into mosaic when your in the e-mail menu?
</B></A><br>
My answer is...To get into  mosaic from the pine menu you have to move 
the cursor to the left of the box where the boundary meets. Once you get 
there and hold onto the mouse button you will see a menu screen that 
gives you choices such as<a 
href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Starting 
Points/NetworkStartingPoints.html"> World Wide Web.</a> If you highlight WWW 
and move 
the cursor to the right it will give you Mosaic choices. Select one and 
your into Mosaic. Once your into Mosaic your choices are unlimted. A good 
selection off of the list to find out what's going on with Mosaic is to 
look into the<a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/"> NCSA 
What's New</a>. This gives you information about everything.

<LI><A NAME="QQ2"><B>What is a hotlist?</B></A><br>
My answer is... A hotlist is a place to store information and subject 
titles that I found interesting on the Web. The things that I found 
interesting to me I put on my hotlist to save them just in case I wanted 
to refer to them I could just go to my hotlist and retrieve them. Some 
things that I found interesting on the Web that I put on my hotlist was 
NBA Scores and Highlights, and Car Autos especially<a 
href="http://cbsgil.bu.edu/bmw/bmw.html"> BMW's</a> and 
<a href="http://swiss.ans.net/quattro/">Audi's.</a> <p><A

<LI><A NAME="QQ3"><B>Give a three sentence background history on Aboriginal Studies?</B></A><br>
My answer is...The<a href="http://coombs.anu.edu.au/WWWVL-Aboriginal.html"> 
Aboriginal people</a> live a pretty simple life. 
They live off of the bare necessities of life and they act in ways that 
<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/v-lib/anthropology.html">Anthropologist</a> 
feel that we can trace are history from them. 
Anthropologist think that mankind was derived from the Aboriginies.

<LI><A NAME="QQ4"><B>Who are the anthropologists in Australia dealing with and why are they so important?</B></A><br>
My answer is...Anthropologists are dealing with people in Australia 
called the<a href="http://www.vicnet.net.au/vicnet/COUNTRY/ABORI.html"> 
Aboriginal people</a>. The reason why anthropolgist feel 
that they are so important is because they feel that they are a link to 
mankinds history. This arguement will continue to go on for years. There 
is so much information to be learned and examined by studying these 
people. Some anthropologists say we are descendants from the<a 
href="http://www.vicnet.net.au/vicnet/pictoria/18v15072.jpg.html"> 
aboriginies</a> 
because of the way we look and act. The only way we will find out is 
through time.

<LI><A NAME="QQ5"><B>What is World Wide Web?</B></A><br>
My answer is...WWW puts a bound of information at your fingertips. There 
is vast amount of subjects through WWW that you can look into. It is 
categoriged by different subject headings. It's like looking at newspaper 
through the computer. There is so many ways you can venture and explore 
by using WWW. The information is limitless and it's all at our 
fingertips. You can find out what's going on in<a 
href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html"> 
WWW</a>.  <p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>
