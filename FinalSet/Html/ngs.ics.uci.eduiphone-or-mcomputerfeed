		<description><![CDATA[The thing about the iPhone is, it&#039;s made a personal pocket computer/PDA tool that was only for geeks or business people hip for the socialites!!

Everyone has to have one so they can stay connected be it by phone call, text message, e-mail, facebook or twitter. The fact it&#039;s stylish and essentially the iPod touch with a phone and other features built in made it an easy gadget to push to those that would of never otherwised considered a pocket PC.

Well done Apple!!]]></description>
