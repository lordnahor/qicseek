There are number of
interesting questions concerned with algorithms for
graphs on surfaces.
Indeed, examples of such geometric graphs include
planar convex hulls,
Voronoi diagrams,
Delaunay triangulations,
line arrangements,
visibility graphs,
polygon triangulations,
and Euclidean minimum spanning trees,
which collectively form the backbone of the topics in computational geometry.
This work studies algorithms for graphs such that
the vertices are points in a geometric space and the edges are
curves that are embedded in a surface that is itself embedded in
that space.
In particular,
this project is focused on
algorithms for graphs on surfaces,
directed at the following three thrust areas:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Algorithms for Embedding Graphs on Surfaces</b>:
This is the study of methods for producing geometric configurations from a
combinatorial graph.
Topics of interest in this thrust area include methods for
approximate minimum-genus embedding of graphs, algorithms for
manifold triangulation for a set of points sampled from an embedded
surface, and techniques for drawing trees in the plane, which are of
interest in the visualization of hierarchies, such as organization
charts and object-oriented class hierarchies.
<li>
<b>Algorithms for Graphs Embedded on Surfaces</b>:
This is the study of graph algorithms that take advantage of
additional structure available for graphs
embedded on surfaces.
Topics of interest in this thrust area include
the study of connections between partial cubes and integer lattices,
the development of algorithms for graphs embedded in Non-Euclidean
spaces, such as hyperbolic spaces, and the design of methods for
solving graph problems on quadrilateral meshes, which arise in
surface modeling and animation applications.
<li>
<b>Applications of Algorithms for Graphs on Surfaces</b>:
This is the study of applications of algorithms that are specialized
for graphs on surfaces.
Topics of interest include
applications of geometric graphs to computer graphics,
computer security, greedy
geometric routing in sensor networks, and algorithms for road networks.
