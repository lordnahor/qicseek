		<description><![CDATA[Knee surgeries can be painful. I went through one last year so I know. It took around 2 months for the pain to fade away but still I experience episodes every now and then. I wish you a speedy recovery

		<description><![CDATA[A buddy of mine just had this surgery as wellâ€¦ he was on the mend for a couple of months. After about a month or so he was back to normal but needed regular physical therapy to get his mobility back. He told me life post-surgery is a lot less miserable than life beforehand, so I guess his pain was worse before than any pain he suffered as a result of the surgery itself. Anyways, I hope you feel better! btw, i just recently started reading this blogâ€¦ I enjoy it thoroughly and will be a frequent visitor! [I am now an RSS Subscriber :)]]]></description>
