		<description><![CDATA[yes, you did make it qiote too simple in your article, but I think you have neglected one important fact. The amount of data available in so many forms these days is also denying people access to it if they don&#039;t really need it.
let me explain. 
for example take the book you mentioned, war and peace, I cannot imagine a sane person reading it in our day an age unless it becomes a movie or a pdf file on a computer on which you may use a text reader, we have become too lazy to do simple tasks and we expect machines to do the hard part, even in blogs people don&#039;t really comment anymore, they either cast a vote or share it on facebook.

This face is significant when you analyze how people choose topics\products\service, if you present it well enough - you may get enough people&#039;s attention even if you dont have the best content\product or service.


just my 2 cents]]></description>
