<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<P>In today's business market with it's high level of competition for 
survival many firms will do anything to gain an edge over others in the 
world.  In order to save and make money firms will tend to cut corners 
many different ways. Here are just a few ways a business may cut corners:

<ul>
<li>Using lower quality goods for the production of their own goods.</li>
<li>Using a substitute product by diluting their own good.</li>
<li>Trick consumers, for example by false advertising.</li>
</ul>

As we can see, cutting corners is not that hard to do. With today's 
technology it becomes even easier for a business to try and gain the extra 
edge.  With the emergence of computer advancements such as the Internet 
and the World Wide Web. It provides businesses with a <b>"new tool".</b>
 
<p>We will now examine: 
<ul>
<A href="#nt"><li> How businesses use the "new tool" to advertise on the
web.</li></A>
<A href="#change"><li> How advertising with the "new tool" will change the 
way firms will buy, sell, and do business.</li></A>
<a href="#conc"><li> Is the "new tool" good or bad for 
buisness?</li></A></ul> <hr>

<A name="nt"><h3>How businesses use the "new tool" to advertise on the
web.</h3></A>


<p>This emergence of the "new tool" allows businesses to advertise their 
business, their products, and general information. Advertising on the 
web is not hidden. It takes only a few minutes for a user on a web 
browser to find examples of business advertising. Businesses tend to 
advertise two different ways: <b>directly or indirectly.</b></p>

<p><b>Direct</b> advertising by a business is when a firm will put out a 
specific page on the web showing their product, a  specific service they 
provide via the web, and even products for sale through the web or the 
phone. One can find many examples of direct advertising, such as:
<ul>
<a href="http://www.pizzahut.com/"><li>Ordering pizza from Pizza Hut</li></a>
<a href="http://branch.com/"><li> Visit a mall with that carries almost 
anything you could want.</li></a>
<A HREF="http://dorian.csi.nb.ca/~damber/lobster/"><li>Have lobster 
FedExed from Nova Scotia.</li></A> </ul>
These are just to name a <i>few</i> of the many, many types of 
advertising found on the web. For example one can just look up a 
<a href="http://ibd.ar.com/Catalogs/Catalog.HomePages.html">catalog of 
vendors</a> or just "surf the net" for a product. </p>

<p><b>Indirect</b> advertising by a business is very commonly found, 
whether the firm knows they are advertising or not.  They are 
advertising. This is the whole idea of what indirect advertising is all 
about. Indirect advertising can be found through <a 
href="http://www.yahoo.com/Entertainment/Magazines/"> magazines</a> and 
general information provided by businesses.  Here are a few examples of  
indirect advertising:
<ul>
<a href="http://www.timeinc.com/ew/special/subinfo.html"><li>Entertainment 
Weekly gives us a special subscription offer.</li></a>
<a href="http://att.net/dir800"><li>AT&T gives a list of 1-800 phone 
numbers.</li></a></ul>
<p>Like direct advertising, indirect advertising can be found almost 
everywhere on the web. The question now is: <i>How</i> does a firm 
advertise? A business can do this two ways.  The first way is 
to make a company home page and the second way is to go through an 
advertising service on the web. Even home pages can be processed and 
published through special services. Services like
<a href="http://www.business card.com/businesscard/">Business Cards 
Online,</a> <a href="http://www.mall.net/">Internet Design Group,</A>
and <a href="http://www.zynet.co.uk/zynet/tariff.html">Zynet Services</a>  
can provide firms ads and home pages for the right price. A good 
example of a business home page is <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple 
Computer's</a> home page or <a href="http://www.sony.com/">Sony Music's</a> 
home page.

<A name="change"><h3>How advertising with the "new tool" will change the 
way we will buy, sell, and do business.</h3></a>
<p> The internet has vastly changed the way that businesses have  
traditionally bought, sold, advertised, and communicated, between
themselves and with customers. The internet has increased the<i> speed
</i> in which businesses can reach the consumers. It has reduced the<i>
cost</i>associated with advertising. The internet<i> expands the  
range</i> to which advertising and marketing reaches.<a 
href="http://tig.com/IBC/White/Communication.html"> Communication 
</a>between the consumers and suppliers has also been bettered through the 
use of the  internet.</p>

<p>The cost of advertising and marketing a product has traditionally been
high and to change the product line and then communicate the changes to
the consumer can be very cost-prohibitive, especially if done frequently.
Assuming a 250 page catalog costs on the average $1.55 to produce, mailing
this to 250,000 people costs $387.800! The internet, even if we assumed
comparable cost can reach 20 million people. Think about the costs to
update and send out a new catalog for summer. A <a 
href="http://www.shopping2000.com/">list of virtual catalogs</a> 
can already be found on the internet. An advertisement on the internet can be
constantly updated and changed for a low cost. The speed of internet
<a href="http://tig.com/IBC/White/Intermarket.html">marketing, sales, and 
service</a> can also help to keep ahead of the competitor. Consumer trends
can almost immediately be addressed and changes made to change the firm's
actions accordingly. This saves  the company time and money. </p>  

<p>The range and scope to which internet marketing and advertising   
reaches is another change with which business must cope. larger and more
diverse groups of people can be reached on the web that may greatly
enhance a firm's exposure and help them to reach a new consumer base that
would normally be restricted due to cost or lack of information. The  
global aspect of the internet also makes any firm international and provides
customers all over the world. Quite a benefit to any business.</p>  

<p>The aspect of increased and better communication between the producer 
and consumer may be one of the most beneficial. Not only can a consumer  
order over his own computer at home or at the office, the firm can
process his order and even communicate via e-mail. E-mail is the most 
used of all internet tools and could become an important part of the   
business world. Examine a scenario where a business provides the   
marketing, and sale of a product over the internet. A person across the 
world orders it and instantly his order is processed. If he chooses he
provides his e-mail address and fills out a short questionaire about  
himself and the product that he has just purchased. The firm also
provides an e-mail address if the consumer has any problems. A week late 
the product has arrived and The consumer tries to put it together or
install it or figure out how it works. He cannot. He e-mails the company
which has 24 hour help and they send on-line text, pictures, diagrams and 
anything else that the consumer may need. This also is coupled with the
standard 1-800 phone line. So the buyer has his product, all the   
information he can ask for, plus he gets it in the fastest time possible.
The business saves time and money on paperwork, gets info about the   
consumer that can help in their research and marketing, plus they have a
fully satisfied customer. The better knowledge gained by the company about
the consumer through better communication results in the elimination of  
costs by offering what the consumer does want. The information and feedback
can also result in the bettering of a product. This may be more likely  
through the internet due to the impersonal nature of using a computer to 
write  your comments via <a href="http://www.sco.com/comments.html">a 
comment form,</a> or answer some questions, ratherthan talking to a  
representative on the phone or having to write and mail a questionaire. </p>

<p>While all of this may sound as a too-good-to-be-true advertising   
utopia, be careful of what really exists and what actually can be done of
the internet. While 16 million people use the internet and its potential 
seems limitless, The actuality is that advertising here is a little bit  
different than the television-based kind that the average American is
used to. New graphics, audio and video are beginning to transform the  
internet, the text based approach is still used heavily. Information on 
the internet is demanded and given. The evolution has provided a new look 
to the internet, but a certain <a 
href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Provider/Etiquette.html">web 
etiquette</a> has been required of those that use this resource.  The  
result is a give and take idea. Considerable quantities of information 
are given and passed on the web and is given freely. The company that 
wishes to take and not give back may not be received so openly among the 
internet users.</p>

<h3>CONCLUSION-Our opinion</h3>

<p>The internet is a tool that can be very useful for business. As both
the internet and the business world evolve, the union between the two is
inevitable. Already firms are discovering the usefulness and potential   
that the internet brings to their businesses. But can the internet handle 
the increased influx of use and information that can be provided by the  
swarm of businesses and their marketing and advertising strategies. Under
its full potential the internet would be a wonderful thing. The
convenience that would be provided to consumers is without equal in our
society today. Firms would better be able to serve, communicate, and
expand across this electronic highway. Business would be transacted in
such a new, faster way that would involve more interaction and
information retrieval that would cut down on the costs normally associated
with business today. The internet, however, is not ready today for 
this amazing influx of information. The development of the internet must 
equal the increased demand for the use on it. The increased use of 
business on the internet is not a bad thing, and in time it will develop 
into a great resource for businesses, but for now business should not 
overshadow the real purpose of the internet which is to provide  
information on a global scale.</p>
