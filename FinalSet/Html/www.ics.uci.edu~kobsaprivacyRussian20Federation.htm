- Laws and other regulations which concern the legal position
of the government bodies, territorial self-governing bodies, organisations
and social associations, or the rights, freedoms and duties of
the citizens, and procedures involved;

- Documents in the public collections of libraries and archives,

interest or essential for the exercise of citizens' rights, freedoms
and duties.
<P>
4. The federal law &quot;On State Secrecy&quot; determines the
significance of the information for state secrecy.
<P>
5. The decision about confidentiality of information is made on
the basis of the Russian Federation's legislation; Section 11
of this federal law should be applied.
<H4>Article 11 Information on citizens (personal data)</H4>

<P>
1. The nature of personal data which should be stored in the federal
information resources, information resources of the territorial
self-governing bodies and nongovernment organisations is specified
by federal law.
<P>
Personal data is regarded as confidential information. 
<P>
<a name="article11"></a>
Collection, storage, usage and dissemination of information about
private life, and processing of information which concerns personal
and family secrecy, or encroaches upon post, telephone or telegram
secrecy or the secrecy of other forms of communication between
persons is only permissible if a legal provision provides for
this, or the person affected has agreed.
<P>
2. Personal data may not be used to inflict economic or moral
damage on citizens, or to impede the exercise of the rights and
freedoms of the citizens of the Russian Federation. Restriction
of the citizens' rights on the basis of information on social
origin, race, nationality, language, religion or party membership
is forbidden and is punished according to the law.
<P>

collect or use personal data, bear the responsibility based on
the Russian Federal legislation for the violation of the provisions
which govern the collection, processing and use of this information.

<H3>Part 3 Use of the Information Resources</H3>

<H4>Article 12 Realization of the access right to the information
contained in resources </H4>

<P>
1. The users - citizens, government bodies, territorial self-governing
bodies, organisations and social associations - have the same
rights at their disposal to the government information resources,
and are not obliged to demonstrate the necessity of their requirement.
The exception is the restricted access information.
<P>
The access of the natural and legal persons to the government
information resources represents an important precondition for
the execution of social control of all government bodies, territorial
self-governing bodies, social, political and other organisations;
the control of the economic and ecological situation and control
in the other areas of community life are also made easier by this
means.
<P>
2. According to the statutes, official regulations and information
supply agreements, the possessors of informational resources grant
information users access to the information needed by them on
the basis of the applicable legislation.
<P>
Information which the citizens and organisations obtain from the
government information resources may be used for preparing commercial
information; information altered in this way may only be disseminated
afterwards with references to its origin.
<P>
The source of profit results in this case from the aggregate of
work used in creating the commercial information and applied resources,
but the emergence of the information from the information resources
is unavoidable.
<P>
3. Information access arrangements (access location and time,
persons responsible, obligatory procedures) are specified by the
owners or possessors of the information resources; these are obliged
to take into account the legal conditions.
<P>
Directories of information and information services, as well as
information about the procedures and conditions of access to information,
are available to the users free of charge.
<P>
4. Government bodies and other organisations responsible for the
structuring and use of the information resources assure operative
and unimpeded access to the documented information for those who
need it, according to the duties specified in their statutes.
<P>
5. The way of collecting and storing documented information with
restricted access, and the protection rules and conditions of
use relating to this, are given by the government bodies who are
responsible for certain types of information or information sets.
They may also be specified directly by the information owner according
to the legal provisions.
<H4>Article 13 Granting access to information </H4>

<P>
<a name="article13_1"></a>
1. Government bodies and territorial self-governing bodies are
obliged to establish generally accessible information collections,
which store information about their area of operation and those
of their subordinate organisations.

Within their jurisdiction they also guarantee public access to
the information about citizens' freedoms and duties, and about
their safety; and also to the other information which is important
from the point of view of the public interest.
<P>
2. Refusal of access to the information resources mentioned in
Section 13 Subsection 1 can be challenged in court.
