This was my favorite exhibit in the museum.  An inscription on the entrance said something about how, in the older days when women would wash the floors on their knees every day, it made a gesture very similar to prayer.  In this dark room, projectors cast shadows of cleaning liquid bottles against the wall, forming figures like the shadows of women in a chapel-like atmosphere.
