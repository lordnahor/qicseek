heritage:</FONT></P></CENTER>

<UL>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Three Affiliated Tribes-the Mandan, Hidatsa,
and Arikara- stay on the Fort Berthold Reservation.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara were established
in the Dakotas between 1500-1700.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Maize, squash, beans, pumpkin, tobacco, and sunflowers
were primary crops among the Mandan.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Mandan speak a Siouan dialect.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">The village of Good Fur Robe had occupied the
present day site of Mandan in 1738. The original residents journeyed here
from the Gulf of Mexico or the South Atlantic Coast.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Mandan were peaceful people and survived
off the land.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">The principal source of food and clothing was
the buffalo.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">The tribe held a festival to honor the buffalo
every year. This would mark the season for the buffalo's return.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Mandan lived in permanent earth lodge villages
for centuries before the coming of the white man.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Mandan and Hidatsa were considered the 'farmers,
merchants, and bankers' of the northern plains.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">After the death of a family member, a Mandan
would mourn for a year.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">In 1804, President Thomas Jefferson commissioned
William Clark and Meriwether Lewis to explore the Missouri River and find
a route to the Pacific Ocean by the Columbia River.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Mandan lived on the Missouri River between
the Heart River and the Little Missouri Rivers, N.D.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Mandan became historically famous when Lewis
and Clark chose the site of the Mandan settlement to build the first winter
camp in 1804-05. Fort Mandan is named after the Indians who befriended
the expedition party and it was built on the banks of the Missouri River.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851 established the
Fort Berthold Reservation for the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara. The Fort
Berthold Reservation is located in central North Dakota. The west and south
segments of the reservation is rough grassland and &quot;badlands.&quot;</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Fort Laramie Treaty established a large area
of land described vaguely as the entire right bank of the Missouri River
from the mouth of the Yellowstone River and from the mouth of the Powder
River to the Heart River. This piece of land included parts of Wyoming,
Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota. The area was named to honor an
American Fur Company founder, Bartholomay Berthold.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Between 1851 and 1891, on executive orders and
congressional acts changed the size of the reservation from 13,500,000
acres to 930,000 acres. In 1954, the reservation lost 152,300 acres of
land to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for the filling of the Garrison
Reservoir.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">1937 marks the last of the small pox epidemics.
This epidemic resulted in population decline of the Mandan to the point
where it could no longer function as an independent unit.</FONT></LI>
