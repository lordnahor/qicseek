<H2> CompSci 165: Project in Algorithms and Data Structures
    <BR> Spring 2014 </H2>
</center>

<H3>Description</H3>
   <UL>
     <LI> Design, implementation, execution, and analysis of algorithms
     <BR> Based on material from ICS 46 and CompSci 161, plus some more
          advanced topics
     <LI> The programming language will be C/C++ (each student's choice)
     <LI> There are 3 required projects,
          no homeworks and no examinations
     <LI> <B>Prerequisites</B>:
        CompSci 161 / CSE 161. &nbsp; <B>Recommended:</B> ICS/CSE 45C
   </UL>
<H3>Class meetings</H3>
   <UL>
     <LI> Lectures M W F 10-10:50am in DBH 1300
     <BR> Lectures discuss the theory behind the projects,
               as well as some implementation concerns
     <LI> The class meets only sporadically during the quarter,
          typically a couple of times for each of the projects
     <LI> One-on-one discussions with the instructor
               are available throughout the quarter

Some projects need to measure <a href="TIME/index.html">time</a> usage.
<BR> Be aware that using an ANSI compliant compiler
     that has the standard libraries is a necessity.
<BR> Many such compilers are available,
     including gcc which is available on all ICS machines.
<BR> I enjoyed using the <a href="http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/">djgpp</a> command line environment for the PC (XP and 32-bit Windows 7).
<BR> After getting 64-bit Windows 7, I enjoy using the <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a> command line environment.
<BR> Some people enjoy using the <a href="http://www.codeblocks.org">Code::Blocks</a> IDE,
but others have said that they had compilation problems using it.
<BR>
(It seems to be missing some library functions and/or include files needed for timing.)
<small>
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
     The Microsoft compilers that I have seen
     do not use the standard libraries.
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa271961(VS.60).aspx">This page</a>
has Microsoft's suggestions on how to write code that works in the
largest number of C compilers (i.e., portable code).
<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<a href="visual.txt">Here</a> is a tip from a CompSci 165 student on using Visual Studio.
</small>
<BR> Do you know the meanings of and distinction
     between precision and accuracy?
<BR> Many projects need a random number generator;&nbsp;
     I recommend using <a href="dshrandom.c"><tt>dshrandom.c</tt></a>.
