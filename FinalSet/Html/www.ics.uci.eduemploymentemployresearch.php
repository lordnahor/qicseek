Department of Computer Science<br/>
Undergraduate Research Internship Program <br/>
University of California, Irvine<br/>
</strong></p>
<p>
We welcome applications for a newly launched summer undergraduate research internship program at the UC Irvine Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences. Selected students will get an opportunity to visit UCI during the summer of 2014 and spend roughly 8-10 weeks working with faculty on exciting research projects. Projects are expected to cover a wide variety of topics including artificial intelligence, data management, embedded systems and architecture, machine learning, networking, systems and software, secure computing, and theoretical computer science.
</p>
<p>
<b>Who should apply?</b> <br/>
The internships are open to both domestic and international students enrolled in an undergraduate Computer Science program (or related field) who are currently in their junior or senior year. (In exceptional cases, recent graduates also will be considered). The internships are suitable for highly motivated undergraduate students, potentially interested in exploring doctoral studies, who wish to gain valuable research experience. It is especially well suited for students considering UCI as a possible destination for their doctoral study. The internship provides an opportunity for students to visit UCI, discover the charm of Southern California, get to know our faculty, and participate in research projects that are changing the computing landscape. 
</p>
<p>
The students will be hired as Junior Specialists for a period of 8 to 10 weeks in the summer of 2014. Salary will be approximately $2,000 per month based on the full time monthly rate of $2,948.
