    <h1>Oral Presentations</h1>

<p> 
<p> This handout will review some notes you should remember for your oral presentations.

<p> <b>Submission:</b> Make sure that by your presentation date, you have uploaded your presentation into the appropriate "Presentation" folder in the EEE dropbox. You should upload either a powerpoint file or a PDF.

<p> <b>Title slide:</b> In addition to your presentation title, your title slide should have your name and e-mail address so that students can directly send comments to you (CC-ing me). 

<p> <b>Evaluation:</b> We will be grading primarily on your presentation preparation, including the quality of your slides. We will not grade down significantly for speaking style or loudness of voice or oratorical polish, though we do expect that you will try to address your intended audience appropriately. We will not grade down at all for nervousness (though we hope that will abate as the quarter progresses) or English pronunciation or the speaker's personality. We will use the following rubric as a guide:

<p> <b>Student critique:</b> Each student will be required to send an e-mail critiquing one presentation each day of presentations. You will send a mail directly to the student CCing me. You will <b> not </b> report a numerical score, but rather report one positive and negative point about the presentation using the above as a guide.
