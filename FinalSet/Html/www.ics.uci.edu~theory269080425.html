<h1>
Finding Optimal Refueling Policies in Transportation Networks
</h1>

<h2>authored by Shieu-Hong Lin</h2>

<h2>presented by Nate Gertsch</h2>

<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>
<p>

which specify the transportation paths and refueling operations
along the paths to minimize the total transportation costs between vertices.
