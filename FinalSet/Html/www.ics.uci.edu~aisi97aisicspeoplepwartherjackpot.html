<p>The jackpot is a fishing tradition, where everyone that is fishing puts in
a set amount of money, and whoever catches the largest fish takes all the
money.  This is nice with a couple of friends sitting on their boat fishing.
When you apply it to a boat full of 40 people, whoever wins will be more than
a little happy.  To start out with, one dollar is taken out of each person's
ticket fee.  This does not put everyone in the jackpot though.  To enter the
jackpot, you must put in four dollars when you sign up to get your catch bag
(which costs a dollar).  This money is then placed into the jackpot.  So
on a boat with 40 people adding to the jackpot, the winner makes $200.  That
could pay for a couple of future fishing trips.</P>
<p>Fish filleting is also offered on the boat at the price of 50 cents per
fish, up to 2 dollars per large fish.</p>
