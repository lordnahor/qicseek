MOVE and COPY:

Can you change Ref-Type, Ref-Target, Ref-Integrity, Hide-Target at the new location?  The current spec says you can change Ref-Type, Ref-Target, Ref-Integrity.  Hide-Target is not addressed.
</UL><UL>
Can you change Resource-Type on a MOVE or COPY?
</UL><UL>
[WebDAV] Section 7.4 allows you to LOCK a null resource and then perform a PUT or MKCOL on it.  So it seems as if you should also be able to perform a MKREF on it.  A lock-null resource has no value for DAV:resourcetype?  It gets a resource type when PUT, MKCOL, or MKREF is performed on it.  All the MKREF headers get applied only with the MKREF request, not the LOCK.
</UL><UL>
Aside: Do we need a DAV:hidetarget property?  If we want clients to be able to change whether a referenceï¿½s target is hidden after the reference has been created, we either have to provide such a property or have clients submit another MKREF request (in effect replace the existing reference with a new one) with the Hide-Target header present or absent.</UL> </P>
