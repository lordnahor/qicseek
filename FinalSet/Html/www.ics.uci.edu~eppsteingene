<p>Gene is a shareware genealogy database for the Macintosh written
by David and Diana Eppstein.  You can use
Gene to store family data and notes, draw and print family trees
and pedigree charts, create web pages from your database, and
exchange GEDCOM data with users of other genealogy programs. Gene
is capable of handling complicated databases with thousands of
names, multiple marriages and divorces, adoptions, illegitimate
children, and intermarriage between relatives.</p>

<p><font color=red>OS X NEWS:</font> As of November 2003, coding is in
progress on a rewrite of BibGene, a simpler bibliographic database that
shares most of its code with Gene.  Most of the back end database
processing is in place, we have a tentative UI design, and front end
implementation is beginning: everything on the File menu works (reading
and writing multiple file formats including a new XML format and the old
Classic format) but most other UI features are not yet implemented.  It
is looking likely that a preliminary version of BibGene will be ready
for release by the end of the year.  Gene will take some time longer
than that, because it includes some more complex features (pictures and
tree drawing) not used in BibGene.  In the meantime, Gene still runs
well under the Classic environment of OS X, but Gene and BibGene are the
only classic programs I still use regularly so I am quite interested in
getting them updated.  Stay tuned...</p>
