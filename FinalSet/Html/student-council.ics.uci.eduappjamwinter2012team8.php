				Nappkin is a mind-mapping application for the Android environment. It allows you to note down any ideas that spontaneously come, any ideas that you are not familiar with and want to find out more about, or anything that you want to get other peoples opinions on. You can then use the knowledge of others to self-improve on the topic of interest. With Nappkin, there is an intuitive interface in which the user can create a "bubble" about any topic by tapping on the screen. This "bubble" can then be sent to anyone in your contact list and they have the ability to add their insights and comments. These will then become connected to original bubble and you will have a map of ideas.

					We met at the Kick-off event and started brainstorming ideas on the first day. There were two main ideas that stood out based on the theme of self-improvement. We realized that there are so many ideas that the average person has and these ideas are just lost because they don't write them down. In addition to this, self-improvement seemed like such a broad topic. There are no two people with identical things to improve on. We wanted an application that could apply to everyone. While thinking about this, one of the group members just thought of a napkin to jot down notes. When someone has random thoughts at a coffee shop, restaurant, or outside place, they write it down on a napkin. In that same way we thought of Nappkin to document the idea. We also knew for self-improvement, we would need the help of other people. This is where the mapping ideas came about where the user would write a thought they were curious about and then send it to various people in their contact list. Other people can then add to the topic and help the original user to learn about their desired thought.

				We first made all team members install Eclipse with Android SDK with Platform 2.1, 2.3 and 4.0 along with Subclipse that would be required for subversion and for a group of people editing the same code. The idea of Nappkin was decided on the first day, but we discussed the GUI a little and agreed upon rounded rectangles for text to go in and translate functionality to scroll through the map. We broke off into two teams, a back-end and front-end group that would focus on their respective tasks. The back-end group worked on the server-client interaction, on how to send the map to specified users in the contact list as well as sending updated maps to the involved contacts. The front-end group worked on the GUI from a blank slate. They also worked on gesture control, canvas, the bubbles for the ideas, and the actual application that would go on the Android device. We finished the front-end part first and ran into a lot of trouble on client-server notifications. We finally made a breakthrough with OSC (sockets) and then compiled an efficient program for Android users.

            <div class="page-header">
				<div class="styled_title"><h1>Major hurdles that had to be overcome</h1></div>
			</div>
			<p>
				The obvious hurdle for all teams would be time. Writing an application in 7 days is no easy task. A challenge we ran into was that Week 8 was midterms for some of our members so it was hard to find time to get together everyday. We had to do most of the work that was to spread out over 7 days in 4 days, spending over 10 hours a day and sacrificing sleep and food. In addition to this, the client-server on the back-end was extremely difficult to implement. We went through 4 different implementations with C2DM, HTTPPOST, XMPP, and finally chose OSC. On the front-end the translate functionality on the GUI took hours to figure out.

            <div class="page-header">
				<div class="styled_title"><h1>Lessons Learned</h1></div>
			</div>
			<p>
				Time management is always an important thing for any project. Because of this, we learned you should always start early. Even if it is for an hour a day, put time in everyday to discuss the app. If an idea isn't working, it is a big waste of precious time to try to force it to make it work. There is no harm in scrapping an original idea and searching for a new, more efficient method. Most of the time was wasted in finding a server-client that worked and the networking aspect. Everyone has their own skills so decompose bigger tasks to subtasks and assign it to individuals.
