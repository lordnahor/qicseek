<b> Course description </b> <br>
This seminar course will examine the state-of-the-art in visual recognition. It should be of relevance to students interested in computer vision, machine learning, and/or computer graphics. After a brief introduction, the bulk of this course will consist of student paper presentations. Each student will be presenting <b> one research paper </b> from the list provided. One week <b> prior </b> to the date of your presentation, you will be required to give a dry run of your presentation to me. The goal of this class is to provide students with enough background to read/understand/implement current papers in the feild, and engage in research themselves.
<br><br>

<b> Prerequisite:</b><br>
As this is a graduate seminar, the main requirement is interest in the material.
<br><br>

<b> Textbook:</b><br>
There is no required textbook for the course. We will be examining papers from the collection listed here [TBD].
<br><br>

<b>Grading:</b> <br> The grade will be determined by the quality of the paper presentation and class participation.
