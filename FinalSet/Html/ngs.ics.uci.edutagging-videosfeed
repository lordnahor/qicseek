		<description><![CDATA[I was taking a class with Paul Dourish and we talked about the next generation of designed objects.  One of the main texts we used in the talk was  Shaping Things, which purports that a RFID tagged wine bottle fifteen years from now will not just be a wine bottle.

It will be the wine bottle plus a massive respository of information about the wine bottle.  It will be the user experience at the winery website whose URL is printed on the label.  It will be the fully recorded and availble history of the bottle from its molding in Italy to its arrival in your kitchen.   It will be countless websites devoted to capturing and parsing information about the varietal and the harvest.  It will be both a wine bottle and an entry point into a huge collection of metadata about the wine bottle.

Thinking about what Veotag is doing makes me wonder if the same thing is happening to video.]]></description>
