		<description><![CDATA[Ramesh,

You are absolutely right that Moore&#039;s law is only one piece of the problem for bringing AI capabilities into actual products.  The fundamental science has to advance enough as well. I think we are converging in both NLP and Computer Vision over the next 5-10 years sufficient to make large-scale applications that really change things (though I know more about the former than the latter). 

So far the two technologies have been isolated, but it will be interesting to see what happens when they can work together. For example, a vision system may tag objects, scenes, and relationships, which could then be queried in natural language.

I also agree with Bradley that man + machine &gt; machine.  A little bit of human effort can go a long way.  As a slightly otherworldly example, 
there is some interesting work at NASA by Terry Fong in which mobile robots call on humans to solve perceptual subproblems, while the AI controls the overall process.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ramesh and Bradley,

You are write.  The hard part about Riya is that when you talk to people about it, their imagination runs wild.  When we launched Riya our registration flow even said it was &quot;only as smart as a two year old.(interms of recognition ability).&quot;  

I do however feel that if you narrow your application there are areas that computer vision can succeed in.  I would love for both of you to join our private alpha for Riya&#039;s next product which will be launched in about a month.  I would love your feedback and advice.  Email me at blog3 at munjal.com]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks.
Computer vision can, and hopefully soon will, play important role in many applications.  Image retrieval will be only one of those.  There are some interesting challenges that must be solved in vision for that to happen.  

Because you caught the pun, did you see &#039;Ignorance, Myopia, and Naivette in Computer Vision&#039; that appeared in Computer vision, Graphics, and Image processing about 15 years ago?]]></description>
