<h2>Missingness: A short write up</h2>
<p><i> What design of survey may introduce missingness to data? </i></p>
<p>We are currently interested in -<i> sexual contact life-history data</i>. Through this description there might be terms from that content. A tie might be referred to <i> a relationship</i>, a vertex that tie to another might be referred as <i> a partner </i>.</p>
<h3> Missingness introduced by different designs</h3>

<h4>Case I. Ties over a length T interval</h4>

<p> Suppose in the survey, we ask egos to provide all ties over a length T interval. If left censoring occurs then any onsets that are earlier than the lower threshold t_l will be recorded as t_l. Similarly if right censoring occurs then any termini that are later than the upper threshold t_u will be recorded as t_u. In this case one of the start and the end time might be missing for some times. </p>

<h4>Case II. Snapshots of network instances</h4> 
<p> Interval censoring occurs when the dataset consists a series of snapshots of the network instances. Onsets and termini are somewhere between two consecutive timestamps but the exact values are unknown. A example of this censoring would be, if we capture a person's friends on Facebook every week, and we observe a new friendship at week 5. Then we know the time the ego starts a friendship with this alter between week 4 and 5, but we can not observe the exact time.</p>


<h4>Case III. Last K ties</h4>
<p> Suppose in the survey, an ego is asked to provide the last K ties that he/she either is currently tied with, or have most recently ended a tie with. In this case the co-occurrence ties are unknown before the end time of the last tie.
