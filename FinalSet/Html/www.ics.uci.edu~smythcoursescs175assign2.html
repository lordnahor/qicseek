<h3>Instructions for Assignment 2</h3>
The goal of this week's assignment is to construct some basic "building
blocks" for our learning algorithms, in particular to build a
"nearest-neighbor
classifier", and to get you further acquainted with MATLAB and its
plotting
capabilities in particular.
<p>The assignment consists of three parts. In part 1, you will load in
two simulated data sets and look at their properties. In part 2, you
will
implement a k-nearest neighbor classification algorithm, in part 3 you will visualize the errors that this classifier makes, and in part 4 you
will test if and how the accuracy of this model can change as a
function
of k.<br>
</p>
<p>Before you begin the programming part of the Assignment you should
review the following in the MATLAB documentation. Some of this will be
review from the tutorial material you covered in Week 1 and some will
be new material. You can find these topics in MATLAB software under the &quot;Help -&gt; MATLAB Help&quot; menu item. <br>

<h4>Part 1: Classification Data Sets</h4>
You need to <a
 href="data_for_assignment2">download</a> two different ".mat" files called <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">simdata1.mat</span> and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">simdata2.mat</span>. You should save each
of these in your local working directory. The two files consist of two
different classification data sets, to be referred to as SimulatedData1
and SimulatedData2. Each data set is stored as a binary MATLAB file, simdata1.mat and
simdata2.mat.
You can load them into MATLAB simply by typing (for simdata1 for
example):<br>
<pre>&gt;&gt; load simdata1;<br>&gt;&gt; simdata1<br><br>simdata1 =&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shortname: 'Simulated Data 1'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; numfeatures: 2<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; classnames: [2x6 char]<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; numclasses: 2<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; description: [1x66 char]<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; features: [200x2 double]<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; classlabels: [200x1 double]<br><br>&gt;&gt; simdata1.numclasses<br><br>ans =<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2<br><br>&gt;&gt; simdata1.description<br><br>ans =<br><br>Simulated separable 2-class 2-dimensional data,  CS 175, Fall 2007</pre>
where here we see that simdata1 is a MATLAB structure with several
different
fields. The fields tell us that "simdata1" has 2 classes, 2 features,
and
contains some other background information. simdata1.features contains
the actual feature values, which has dimension 200 rows by 2 columns.
Each
row is a particular example, the&nbsp; two columns are the two feature
values for this feature (the "feature vector"). simdata1.classlabels
contains
the classlabels for the corresponding features in simdata1.features,
i.e.,
the first entry is the class label for the first row in
simdata1.features
and the class labels are assumed to take value either 1 or 2.
<p>Your first assignment is to load in the data, and write a simple
function
which takes as input a data structure with the same fields as
"simdata1"
above, and produces a figure which plots a 2-dimensional plot of the
feature
vectors, i.e., the x-axis is feature 1 (column 1) and the y-axis is
feature
2 (column 2) (this is called a "scatter plot"). The function should
also
take 2 optional arguments, namely 2 integers which specify which
features
(columns) are to be plotted: this is useful for data sets where there
are
more than 2 features, since we can only plot two at a time in this
manner.
If these two arguments are not specified, the function should choose
features
1 and 2 to plot by default.
</p>
<p>The function should also plot the points from each class in
different
colors (you can assume if you wish that there are only 2 classes, named
"1" and "2": most of our project assignments will likely only involve
2-class
problems). The commands
</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt; plot(d(:,x), d(:,y), 'r*')</pre>
will plot the values of feature y against feature x, using red "stars".
You will need to figure out how to generalize this so that it plots
data
points from class 1 in one color and data points from class 2 in
another
color. The "hold" command is useful for keeping the results of several
plot commands on the screen. You will also need to use the logical
subscripting
feature of MATLAB to find which examples belong to which class.
<p>Your function needs have the following header information (you need
to give it this exact name and have these arguments in this order).
</p>
<pre>&nbsp; function classplot(data, x, y);<br>&nbsp; %&nbsp;&nbsp; function classplot(data, x, y);<br>&nbsp; %<br>&nbsp; %&nbsp; brief description of what the function does<br>&nbsp; %&nbsp; ......<br>&nbsp; %&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your Name, CS 175, date<br>&nbsp; %<br>&nbsp; %&nbsp; Inputs<br>&nbsp; %&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; data:&nbsp; (a structure with the same fields as described above:<br>&nbsp; %&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your comment header should describe the structure explicitly)<br>&nbsp; %&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that if you are only using certain fields in the structure<br>&nbsp; %&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the function below, you need only define these fields in the input comments<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --------&nbsp;&nbsp; Your code goes here -------<br><br></pre>
Feel free to add other features such as labeling the axis, adding a
title
to the plot, etc.
<br>
<br>
Once you have written this function you should be able to call this
function with <span style="font-family: monospace;">as </span><small><span
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">classplot(simdata1,
1, 2)</span></small>&nbsp;
and see that&nbsp; the data from 2 classes can be perfectly separated
in the first dimension (the x-axis).&nbsp; If you <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">call </span><small><span
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">classplot(simdata2,
1, 2)</span></small>&nbsp;
you should see that the 2 classes are now overlapped and each cloud of points has a&quot;non-linear&quot; shape, and the 2 classes can not be
separated with a single line.<br>
&nbsp;
<h4>Part 2: k-Nearest Neighbor Classifier</h4>
You are to implement a MATLAB function which implements the k-NN
classifier.
The pseudocode for this algorithm is roughly as follows. Note that
there
is no "training" as such for this classifier, i.e., it just takes a
training
data set and uses it as a "memory" for classifying new feature vectors.
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; Read in the training data set Dtrain<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; y = feature vector to be classified<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kneighbors =&nbsp; k-nearest neighbors to y in Dtrain<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kclasses = class values of the kneighbors<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kvote = the most common target value in kclasses<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; predicted_class(y) = kvote</pre>
This is a fairly high-level description. The only tricky part is
finding
the k-neighbors. You should use the Euclidean distance to define
"closeness".
Also remember that in Assignment 1 you already implemented a function
to
find the single closest neighbor, so you just need to generalize that
function to find the k nearest neighbors.
<p>You are to implement a MATLAB function which takes as input a
labeled
training data set (with labels) and a test data set (without labels) on
which you will make predictions. The function returns the class
predictions
for the test data set. Note that to call this code you will need to
extract
the feature data matrix and the class label vector from the general
structure
in the last section - you may want to write a simple additional
function
that will do this for you.
</p>
<pre>&nbsp; function [class_predictions] = knn(traindata,trainlabels,k, testdata)<br>&nbsp; % function [class_predictions] = knn(traindata,trainlabels,k, testdata)<br>&nbsp; %<br>&nbsp; %&nbsp; a brief description of what the function does<br>&nbsp; %&nbsp; ......<br>&nbsp; %&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your Name, CS 175, date<br>&nbsp; %<br>&nbsp; %&nbsp; Inputs<br>&nbsp; %&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; traindata: a N1 x d vector of feature data (the "memory" for kNN)<br>&nbsp; %&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trainlabels: a N1 x 1 vector of classlabels for traindata<br>&nbsp; %&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; k:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an odd positive integer indicating the number of neighbors to use<br>&nbsp; %&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; testdata: a N2 x d vector of feature data for testing the knn classifier&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; %<br>&nbsp; %&nbsp; Outputs<br>&nbsp; %&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; class_predictions: N2 x 1 vector of predicted class values<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --------&nbsp;&nbsp; Your code goes here -------</pre>
Please make sure that you implement your function so that it accepts
input
arguments in exactly the format specified above. &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h4>Part 3: Plotting the Errors for a k-Nearest Neighbor Classifier</h4>
In this section of the assignment you will write a function that (1)
builds a kNN classifier (using the code from Section 2), then (2)
calculates the error rate for the classifier and prints this to the
screen, and finally (3) plots the testdata using the first 2 features
where the data from each class is color-coded (same as in the code for
the first part of this assignment) and then also overlays circles on
each of the data points that were misclassified by the classifier. The
top few lines of your code should look like:<br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">function
knn_plot(traindata,trainlabels,k,testdata,testlabels);</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">% function
knn_plot(traindata,trainlabels,k,testdata,testlabels);</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">% </span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">% Predicts
class-labels for the data in testdata using the k nearest</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">% neighbors
in traindata, and then plots the data (using the first</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">% 2
dimensions or first 2 features), displaying the data from each</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">% class in
different colors, and overlaying circles on the points</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">% that were
incorrectly classified.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">%</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">%&nbsp; Inputs</span><br

trainlabels: a N2 x 1 vector of classlabels for traindata<br>
<br>
<big><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">You may
find it useful to use the following in plotting the circles:</span><br
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
<small><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">plot(xvalues,
yvalues,'bo','MarkerSize',10);<br>
<br>
<big><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">You should
then test this code with both simdata1 and simdata2 with different
values of k, and where you split the data in simdata1 and simdata2 into
training and testing subsets (e.g., the first 50% of the rows of the feature data for training,
the 2nd 50% for testing - or randomly partition the rows into training
and testing subsets). You should find that there are no errors produced
on simdata1 (for different k-values and different partitions of the
data) but that the error rate for simdata2 is typically 7 to 10% or higher.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">
</big></span></small></big></span></small><big><span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">&nbsp;</span></big>
<h4>Part 4: Calculating the Error-Rate of the k-Nearest Neighbor
Classifier on SimulatedData2, as the number of neighbors k is varied<br>
</h4>
You are to implement a function that will take in a training data set
with
labels, a test data set with labels, and calculate the errors of the
k-nearest-neighbor classifier for different values of k, k going from
1,
3, 5, 7, to a value kmax. The function returns a vector of
error-rates
of the classifier on the test data set for each value of k. The error
rate is defined as the number of points incorrectly classified divided
by the total number of points, and expressed as a percentage. The
function
also takes an optional parameter "plotflag", which if set to 1 causes
the
function to plot the accuracy as a function of k. The pseudocode for
this
is as follows:
<br>
&nbsp;
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Read in the training data set Dtrain, and Dtest</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For k = 1, 3, 5, ... Kmax (odd numbers)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; classify each point in Dtest using the k nearest neighbors in Dtest</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; error_k = 100*(number of points incorrectly classified)/(number of points in Dtest)</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; end<br><br></pre>
You are to implement a MATLAB function which implements this
pseudocode.&nbsp;
Your MATLAB function must have this input/output format:
<pre>&nbsp; function [errors] = knn_error_rates(traindata,trainlabels, testdata, testlabels,kmax,plotflag)<br>&nbsp; % function [errors] = knn_error_rates(traindata,trainlabels, testdata, testlabels,kmax,plotflag)<br>&nbsp; %<br>&nbsp; %&nbsp; a brief description of what the function does<br>&nbsp; %&nbsp; ......<br>&nbsp; %&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your Name, CS 175, date<br>&nbsp; %<br>&nbsp; %&nbsp; Inputs<br>&nbsp; %&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; traindata: a N1 x d vector of feature data (the "memory" for kNN)<br>&nbsp; %&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trainlabels: a N1 x 1 vector of classlabels for traindata<br>&nbsp; %&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; testdata: a N2 x d vector of feature data for testing the knn classifier&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; %&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; testlabels: a N2 x 1 vector of classlabels for traindata <br>&nbsp; %&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kmax: an odd positive integer indicating the maximum number of neighbors&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; %&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; plotflag: (optional argument) if 1, the error-rates versus k is plotted,<br>&nbsp; %&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; otherwise no plot.<br>&nbsp; %<br>&nbsp; %&nbsp; Outputs<br>&nbsp; %&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; errors: r x 1 vector of error-rates on testdata, where r is the<br>&nbsp; %&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; number of values of k that are tested.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --------&nbsp;&nbsp; Your code goes here -------</pre>
Please make sure that you implement your function so that it accepts
input
arguments in exactly the format specified above. Note that there are
many
possible tricks in terms of trying to speed code like this up. You
could
for example calculate the Kmax nearest neighbors first, store the
results,
and the just use these results to generate the results for kmax-2,
kmax-4,
(without recalculating distances), and so on down to k = 1. However,
you should at least use vectorization where possible, e.g., in computing the Euclidean distance between a vector and each row in a matrix.
The less efficient you make your code, the longer it will take to run
the
experiment below.
<p>Traindata and testdata are to be defined as follows. Traindata is the first 1000 rows of simdata2.features and testdata is the second 1000 rows, i.e.,</p>
<p>traindata = simdata2.features(1:1000,:);</p>
<p>testdata = simdata2.features(1001:2000,:);</p>
<p>(trainlabels and testlabels are defined as the corresponding class label values in simdata2) </p>
<p> You are to use your code to calculate the error-rates on the test
  data
  for all values of k = 1,3, 5, .. 75 using these training and test data
  sets. <br>
  Write a brief one-page summary in of your interpretation of the
  results in
  Part 4, i.e., how the classification error-rate varies (or does not
  vary) as a function
  of k. Include in your document a graph of test error-rates versus
  k (k=1,
  3, 5, .... 49),&nbsp; produced by your code in Part 3 (e.g., you can
  simply
  cut
  and paste the graph from MATLAB to Word, just select "Copy Figure"
  under
  the "Edit" menu in the Figure window in MATLAB).<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Part
  5 (Optional, Extra Credit) Plotting the Classification Boundaries of
  the k-Nearest Neighbor Classifier:</span><br>
A useful function would be to automatically plot the decision
  boundary that is implicitly defined by a training data set, i.e., given
  a training data set with class labels (for up to 5 classes) it
  draws
  the resulting decision boundary for a kNN classifier (where k is
  specified by the user). You
  may want to look at the voronoi.m function in MATLAB to see if it
  provides any ideas on how to do this. Your function should be called
  knn_decision_boundaries.m<br>
  <br>
Note: Part 5&nbsp; is for extra-credit only - if the program works
  completely correctly and is well-documented you will get 1 additional
  bonus point (out of 100) towards your grade in the class. No partial
  credit on this. You should only attempt this if you are confident that
  you understand MATLAB well at this point and have completed and tested
  all of the other parts of this assignment,) <br>
