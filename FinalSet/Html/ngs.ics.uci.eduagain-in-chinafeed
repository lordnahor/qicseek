		<description><![CDATA[I grow up near Huangshan, so I could imagine how you feel when you meet it for the first time. There&#039;s some other Shangrila-like places, such as Li Jiang(means beautiful river), Feng Huang (means phoenix), Jiu Zhai Gou (means nine towns in mountain trench) etc., where you will be encircled by mountains, rivers and ancient dwellings.

As regards your story in the airport, there&#039;s a tradition in China to wait to see guests leaving. Ancient Chinese even accompany a guest for as long as ten miles. As a result, there must be a pavilion in the suburb ten miles off the town. It is built for friends to have a rest and say goodbye. Now you may could understand why your Chinese friend didn&#039;t follow your minds to leave.]]></description>
