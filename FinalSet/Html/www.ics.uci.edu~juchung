<H3>Areas of Interest</H3>
I'm interested in issues in HCI and computer mediated communication in general, though these interests are for now fairly general and nebulous.


<H3>Other Interests</H3>
<p>I'm very interested in languages--I have the equivalent of at least two years of Mandarin, Taiwanese, Spanish, Portuguese, German and Ancient Greek, and have formally studied some Norwegian, French, and Latin.</p>
<p>I'm also a bit of a foodie and an avid bargain hunter.</p>
