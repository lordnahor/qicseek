		<description><![CDATA[Namesake is a great movie... When I was on a trip visiting Singapore (via Dheli) I traveled on a long flight and ended up zoing out to about 4 different films, and caught up on what I had lost. That&#039;s why I like traveling and visiting different places. Each destination always has some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weirdplacestovisit.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;unique places to see&lt;/a&gt;, and the trip there isnt bad either!

Oops looks like &#039;travel to singapore&#039; is an old post :x]]></description>
