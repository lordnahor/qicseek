<B>Three neat Web finds:</B>
<ol>
<li>We've all heard of him. However, some of us have spent more time than 
others reading about and listening to what he has to say. He is Rush 
Limbaugh. Recently, while browsing the web, I came across a document titled<a 
href="http://www.primenet.com/~triplet/files/35truth.html"> Rush Limbaugh's 35 Undeniable 
Truths</a>. I hope you agree that this is a <i>very</i> neat Web finding. 
<li>My second neat Web site I got off of Prof. Douglas Krause's home page. It is a document 
concerning this <a href="http://www.best.com/~dijon/americana/index.html"><img 
src="http://www.best.com/~dijon/images/usaflag2.gif" alt=""> great 
nation</a> of ours. This site is very cool because it includes links to some great American 
documents like the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. <li>The <a 
href="http://www.rutgers.edu/x-files.html>X-Files</a> is one of the best new T.V. shows around. It is 
also a very neat Web site, however, it's best features are audio snippets and the theme song which 
cannot be 
heard in the Pentium lab because of audio capabilities. Nevertheless, this is a site worth checking out 
because of it's pictures and short write-up's.  </ol>

<LI><A NAME="QQ1"><B>What are the three main aspects that characterize the World-Wide Web?</B></A>
The three main characteristics of the World-Wide Web 
are hypertext, multimedia, and the Internet. 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/WhatIs.html">Hypertext</a> refers to the kind of documents 
found on 
the Web. They are basically the same as plain text documents with the added feature of what <a 
href="http://www.csi.uottawa.ca/~dduchier/misc/vbush/as-we-may-think.html">Vannevar Bush</a> 
called "selection by association." With a 
hypertext document there are connections within the text to other related documents. Multimedia simply 
refers to the Web's capability to incorporate graphics, sound, video, and animation in it's documents. 
The Internet is the global mass of cables and computers that make the World-Wide Web possible by 
providing the physical links between the network of computers that make up the Web. <p><A 
HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ2"><B>What is the "client-server architecture" as it relates to the World-Wide 
Web?</B></A>
The client-server architecture is the overall plan by which different computers interact within the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">World-Wide Web</a> schema. The <a 
href="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Terms.html">"client"</a> aspect is actually a computer 
program or browser which runs on a 
computer operated by a human user. The "server" is a computer with a program that runs all the time and 
contains some information. The client contacts the server with a request for information. In response, 
the server provides the information to the client and the human is happy. The client-server 
architecture can also be characterized as an "agent" relationship because a server of one client can in 
turn be a client to another server. <p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ3"><B>What is anthropology and why would someone major in it?</B></A>
<a href="http://c.gp.cs.cmu.edu:5103/prog/webster?anthropology">Anthropology</a> is, in very 
general terms, the study of mankind. This study can include theory of human 
origin and evolution, called physical anthropology, human cultural development, called cultural 
anthropoloy, as well as the study of human social customs and beliefs, called social anthropology. 
There are actually many branches of anthropology which extend into more specific and limited areas, 
such as linguistics and archeology. As to why one would choose to major in the subject, it is 
difficult to say. Perhaps one enters into anthropology after being enthralled by a lecture from one 
of the greats, Richard Leakey for instance. Another reason why someone might choose anthropology as a 
major might be that after extensive <a href="http://wings.buffalo.edu/world/">world travel</a> one realizes 
his/her 
intensive interests in the specifics of the world's various cultures and simply must learn more.<p><A 
HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ4"><B>Who is Richard Leakey and what does he have to do with anthropology?</B></A>
Richard Leakey is the son of Louis and Mary Leakey whose pioneering archaeological field work in the 
eastern regions of <a href="http://wings.buffalo.edu/world/vt2/africa.html">Africa</a> has contributed 
fundamentally to the field of physical anthropology. Richard Leakey has 
continued the work of his parents and is currently the director of the National Museum of Kenya. He has 
written several books concerning the evolution of our species and its possible future, the most recent 
of which is entitled <i>Origins</i>. Mr. Leakey is not only in the forefront of <a 
href="http://c.gp.cs.cmu.edu:5103/prog/webster?archaeology"> archaeology</a> and physical 
anthropology but also contributes to animal protection and preservation in East Africa. He spoke on 
this latter issue last year when he gave a lecture at the Bren Events Center.  <p><A

<LI><A NAME="QQ5"><B>What are some jobs that people in anthropology pursue?</B></A>
Majoring in anthropology allows one to consider entering many different areas in pursuit of a career 
choice. I suppose the most obvious extension of attaining an undergraduate degree in anthropology is to 
continue one's studies in the field by attending graduate school. This route will most likely lead to a 
life of teaching and occasional field studies. One could also use the humanistic background provided by 
an anthropological education to enter fields such as <a 
href="http://www.law.indiana.edu/law/lawindex.html">law</a>, psychology,  
<a href="http://www.analysys.co.uk./commslib.htm">communications</a>, or social work. <p><A
