<img src="nurse.gif" alt="i ">
<A HREF="http://werple.mira.net.au/~dhs/addef.html">Alzheimer's disease</A> is 
the most common form of dementia that occurs in the elderly. 5-10% of the
population over the age of 65 show some sign of the disease.  Alzheimer's
disease can also affect other ages.  Some patients may have symptoms as early
as the fifth decade of life.
People with Alzheimer's disease suffer from a progressive deterioration
in cognitive performance.  Typical symptoms also include confusion and 
forgetfulness.
<p>
<img src="staff.gif">
Alzheimer's exact <A HREF="http://werple.mira.net.au/~dhs/adcause.html">causes</A> are still unknown.  However, current research has found evidence to isolate
individuals who are at high risk to the disease; 
one of them being heredity.  Others also
at risk are a small portion of the population who possess mutations in the
<A HREF="http://werple.mira.net.au/~dhs/adapp.html"><I>amyloid protein precursor
 or APP</I></A> protein localized on chromosome 21.
A large number of the population suffering from the disease are associated with
a locus on chromosome 14.  But because Alzheimer's disease is common in this
region, its precise disease gene can not yet be determined.  Most Alzheimer's
patients have been found to possess one or two copies of the EA allele of the
<A HREF="http://werple.mira.net.au/~dhs/adcause.html">apolipoprotein E</A> gene 
found on chromosome 19.  Persons with the same background are at severe risk to
the disease.  Environmental risks such as head traumas and aluminum toxicity
have also been identified.  One cause proposal, known as the 
<A HREF="http://werple.mira.net.au/~dhs/adcholin.html">cholinergic hypothesis</A>, 
suggests that the reduction in cognitive levels can be caused by a deficiency
in cholinergic neurotransmission.

<LI><A NAME="QQ2"><H2>What is the subject of Paleontology about?</H2></A>
<img src="pubguy.gif" alt="">
<img src="./dino.xbm">
<A HREF="http://ucmp1.berkeley.edu/paleowhat.html">Paleontology</A> is 
a vastly diverse field, divulged in the fascinating pursuit of 
seeing the "long and interesting past and even more intriguing and hopeful 
future".  It's much much more than the study of fossils.  It is the progress
of discovering the ecologies of the past, seeing new ideas and facts 
about evolution, and finding out about where we, as humans, 
belong in this world---all through the study of fossils. 
It is phenomenally diverse in the way it pools its repository of knowledge
from several different areas, such as: biology, geology, ecology,
anthropology, archeology, and, yes, even computer science to analyze and
comprehend the ways the world has evolved and will continue to evolve. 
<p>
How do I know this and why do I sound excited describing it?  I'm excited
not from having from longed so to know about Paleontology but from what 
I just recently came to know about Paleontology after traveling to the 
extremely attractive and well put together homepage of 
the 
<A HREF="http://ucmp1.berkeley.edu/welcome.html">University of California, Museum of Paleontology</A>, 
visiting the spectacular presentation at UC Berkeley's 
<A HREF="http://ucmp1.berkeley.edu/exhibittext/dinosaur.html">Dinosaur Page</A>,
  and touring the distant 
<A HREF="http://ucmp1.berkeley.edu/pin.html">Paleontological Institute of the Russian Academy of Science in Moscow, Russia</A>---all found off a home page
dedicated to the recent unearthing of

<LI><A NAME="QQ3"><H2>What's some back ground info on the Star Trek Voyager?</H2></A>
<img src="voyagerbanner.gif" alt=""> <br>
<img src="voyager.gif" alt="">
The Starship U.S.S. Voyager is an Intrepid-class vessel with a 200 
crew member capacity.  Despite being smaller than the U.S.S. Enterprise,
Voyager is technologically superior than all previous Star Trek vessels and
is among the fastest and most powerful starships in Starfleet.  Despite
its intent of being an exploration and research vessel, Voyager's impressive
defensive and offensive capabilities make aggressors think twice before
engaging it in battle.  

<p>
In Voyager's <A HREF="http://voyager.paramount.com/VoyagerMission01.html">first 
mission</A> to investigate the disappearance of a Marquis
ship, Voyager is swept up by a strange cosmic force and phenomenon and
sent to the outskirts of the galaxy, where traveling at warp speeds it would
take an astounding seventy years for the ship to return home.  
Under the tough and commanding helm of 
<A HREF="http://voyager.paramount.com/VoyagerPerson01.html">
Captain Kathryn Janeway</A>, Voyager's 
objective is to now both explore new worlds and find a way to return home.

<LI><A NAME="QQ4"><H2>What is a URL?</H2></A>
<img src="www.gif" alt="">
<A HREF="http://www.utirc.utoronto.ca/HTMLdocs/NewHTML/url.html">URL</A> is an
acronym for Uniform Resource Locator.  It is the manner in which documents or
data available on the World Wide Web are addressed or referenced.  A 
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/www_faq.html#url">URL</A>  
specifies 4 things:
<OL>
<LI>the agreed upon standard method for transferring the data, known as the 
protocol
<LI>the internet name of the site or server providing the requested resource
<LI>the <I>internet port number</I>
<LI>the location of the resource in the server's directory structure
</OL>
<p>
URL's look like this:
<UL>
<LI>http://info.cern.ch:80/default.html
<LI>ftp://wuarchive.wustle.edu/mirrors/msdos/grapchics/gifkit.zip
<LI>telnet://netcom.com
</UL>
<p>
The protocols seen in the listed examples are 
<A HREF="http://www.utirc.utoronto.ca/HTMLdocs/NewHTML/url_http.html">http</A>, 
<A HREF="http://www.utirc.utoronto.ca/HTMLdocs/NewHTML/url_ftp.html">ftp</A>, 
and 
<A HREF="http://www.utirc.utoronto.ca/HTMKdocs/NewHTML/url_telnet.html">telnet</A>. 
Other protocols not seen include: <A HREF="http://www.utirc.utoronto.ca/HTMKdocs/NewHTML/url_gopher.html">gopher</A>, 
<A HREF="http://www.utirc.utoronto.ca/HTMKdocs/NewHTML/url_wais.html">WAIS searches</A>. 
<A HREF="http://www.utirc.utoronto.ca/HTMKdocs/NewHTML/url_news.html">News</A>, 
and
<A HREF="http://www.utirc.utoronto.ca/HTMKdocs/NewHTML/url_mailto.html">Mailto</A>.
The portions after the colon and two slashes indicate the name of the servers;
<I>info.cern.ch</I>, <I>wuarchive.wustl.edu</I>, and <I>Netcom.com</I> in the
listed examples.  Only the first example specifies a port number; 80 in its 
case.  If no port number is specified, as in the last two seen examples, 
then it is defaulted to 0.  The final portions of the URL is the path of the
object. In our second example <SAMP>/mirrors/msdos/grapchics/</SAMP> is the path
with <I>gifkit.zip</I> as the desired resource.  If no path is given, then
the URL defaults to the root directory as the path.  URL's with a specified
port number may have already an understood path associated with it.  And 
if no resource or object is given, the available resources in 
the path are listed for the viewer's selection---<i>this 
is as far as I know with http only; I've not been able to try it out 
the circumstances with other protocols</I>.

This seems to be a popular topic.  Even as I was working on this document,
I've already been approached by at least half a dozen people asking.   
Here's two ways I've found from reading the <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/www_faq.html">WWW FAQ file</A> I found locally
thru a link in the <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/">ICS 1C homepage</A> 
and remotely through various other
places---I must have ran into this link about a dozen times from different
home pages in one sitting. 
<OL>
<LI>Load the html page you see the image you like.  Switch on the <B>Load to 
Local Disk</B> option if you have it.  Then 
select the <B>Reload Images</B>.  You will then be
prompted for names of the image files as they arrive and await to be saved.  
In my own attempts as this, the X version of Mosaic that I use seems to want
to only save the html document and no images.  Perhaps it's just an error with
my current version.  Try it yourself with on your own Mosaic copy/version or 
other browser, whatever it may be.
<LI>Find out the URL of the image you like by viewing the source of its
HTML document.  Then open do an "Open URL" on it.  Your add-on that you use
to view images with your browswer will display it for you.  And if 
it's not one of those cheesy ones,
it'll permit you to save the image to your local disk. 
</ol>
<P>
The other (brute force) method is to hunt down 
these images yourself tediously by looking
at public archives of pictures and icons.  Here are a couple neat WWW 
achieves laid out especially for inlined HTML documents:
