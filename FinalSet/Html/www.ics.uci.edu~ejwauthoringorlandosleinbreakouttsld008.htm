1. If you do a MKREF with Ref-Target = dref1, does DAV:reftarget get set to dref1 or to its target?
</UL><UL>
You can replace an ordinary target resource with a direct reference.
</UL><UL>
2. Dangling References: the Ref-Target that gets included in the 404 response is the URI of the resource that is missing.  So if a direct reference in the middle of a chain gets deleted, its URI gets returned as the missing Ref-Target.
</UL><UL>
But what about the methods that the spec claims succeed: PUT, MKCOL, MKREF?  They would end up replacing the missing reference, not the resource at the end of the chain.  They have no way of knowing the missing resource was  itself a reference.
</UL><UL>
3. The URI of the final target resource, unless one of the references in a chain is broken?
</UL><UL>
4. There is no way in the current spec.</UL> </P>
