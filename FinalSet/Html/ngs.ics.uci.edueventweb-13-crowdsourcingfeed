		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s very right -- I have difficulty trusting restaurant reviews on different sites when there are only one or two comments -- same about the reviews on Amazon.  This is a human problem that we will try to take advantage of any technology that will emerge.
In case of crowdsourcing the true benefits will appear only when there is really a crowd.  Same as in case of &#039;Wisdom of Crowds&#039;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting article in todays &#039;The Times&#039; (the UK version) which talks about the challenges being faced by travel guides as they are supplanted by online user generated reviews.  The only problem is the ease with which the hotels/restaurants can boost their own rating by offering reviews.  The journalist posed as an online service that would write good reviews in return for cash. They generated interest from even apparantly respectable establishments. 

Such abuse of &#039;citizen submitted opinion&#039; seems certainly to be a threat to its development in the short term. &#039;Crowdsourcing&#039; is fine when there is truly a crowd so that any abuse is lost. However, in the short term, whilst numbers are small, abuse is easy. 

This is a challenge to us all.]]></description>
