        In Spring 2013, I earned a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in Computer Science from the <a href="http://www.uci.edu">University of California Irvine</a> 
        (UC Irvine).
        I focused on issues in performance evaluation, with a focus on the statistical characterization of parallel programs and system performance. During my PhD program I proposed new and practical techniques for cross-system performance modeling, prediction and program optimization 
(refer to the following <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~rcammaro/publications.html">link</a>).  
      </p>

        In Spring 2009, I earned a Master degree in Computer Science with a focus in Embedded Systems from UC Irvine. 
        I focused on issues in the estimation micro-architectural metrics, e.g., Last level of cache bandwidth, from the collection of hardware performance counters across multiple 
        executions of a program, when the number of counters that can be collected in one program execution is fairly small (tytically this number was limited to up to four counters when this work was developed).

        In Spring 2004, I earned a Master Degree in Telecommunication Engineering from the <a href="http://www.unina.it/">Universita' degli Studi di Napoli "Federico II"</a>, Naples, Italy. 
        I focused on the development of analytical models and their numerical implementation for the reconstruction of the electromagnetic 
        field intensity on the ground from airplain survey. Reconstruction algorithms were based on Tikhonov regularization theory.

        During my PhD program I had time to join Internship Programs offered by top companies in Information and Communication Technology. For two summer and one fall quarters (2010-2011),
        I joined <a href="http://info.yahoo.com">Yahoo! Inc.</a>, Sunnyvale, CA, in the role of Performance Engineer Intern. At Yahoo! Inc. I developed novel 
        techniques for program characterization and performance modeling for <i>(a)</i> hardware procurement and <i>(b)</i> the selection of settings for integer 
        compiler heuristics.
        <br> 
        For one summer quarter (2012), I joined <a href="http://www.qualcomm.com">The Office of The Chief Scientist R&D, in Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.</a>, San Diego, CA, 
        in the role of System Security Architect Intern. I worked on the development of development tools for the definition of a secure platform 
        based on a dialect of Java and one modern mobile chipsets.
        <br>
        From 2004 to 2008, I worked as Interim Researcher for the Italian National Research Council (CNR) in Naples, Italy, and Senior Network/System
        Engineer for a CNR start up company, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/company/siris-italia-s.r.l.?trk=top_nav_home"> SIRIS Italia S.r.l.</a>. I developed 
        software for network, system and up to the application layer proactive and active monitoring. I taught several classes on advanced network, system
        design and management. I coordinated small teams (4 to 10 engineers) on the field.
