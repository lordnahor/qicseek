            MusiPad is a gamified, finger rehabilitation platform for stroke, cerebral palsy, and similar patients. The platform consists of Synaptic TouchPadTM and an open source game called Frets on Fire© which is the Python version of the famous Guitar Hero©. Patients suffering from the above-mentioned diseases have difficulty with their finger individuation and/or grasp. "Practice makes perfect" is exactly the case for finger rehabilitation. MusiPad exploits a combination of the force measuring capabilities of the TouchPad as well as the engaging, motivational nature of Frets on Fire game to encourage patients to continue their practice for a long period. The subjects attempt to press their individual fingers to generate a certain force threshold at times specified by notes that are streamed on the LCD. The amount of force threshold can be adjusted for patients with difference strength and levels of impairment. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of MusiPad to provide controlled levels of challenge during an engaging computer game. It also shows MusiPad efficacy in quantifying finger individuation in post-stroke or cerebral palsy patients.

            <p>Current location based recommendation system, like Yelp, provide excellent search based on user's location. However, such system has no aware of user persoanl situation, e.g. on a diet, activity leve. For instance, if user works out hard during the day, then they derseve a high-calory dinner/lunch. However, for user who sit in their office all day long, it is probably good to filter out high-calory restaurants even if they are real good.</p>
            <p>Current mobile phone has lots of sensors that can be utlized to infer user's activity level. Based on that and other user specific information, &quot;Calometer&quot;, a mobile phone application, can provide best fit suggestions for eating.</p>

            <p>Convert a board game about the U.S. presidential election process into a web-based format (this game simulates activities of presidential candidates from the primaries to the election day). Wireframe a comprehensive design using HotGloo (http://www.hotgloo.com). Evaluate design with test users, and audio and screen record their comments. Revise design based on the test users' feedback or give recommendations for a revision. </p>

            <p>Received A+ for being the best project of the class. A commercial version is being developed based on the work done. </p>

            <p>Virtual Reality technology has been achieved a huge success in game area(e.g. WarCraft, StarWar). At the same time, we also witness that nowadays e-commerce has been promoting lots of corporations to be successful(e.g. Taobao,ebay,Amazon). However, to our best knowledge, there is no sucesful case of combing both two areas together. Based on the above consideration, our Extreme Blue team tries to bring 3D technology into e-commerce and see how 3D could benefit the e-commerce. We select an area to start our exploration: "3D Online Auction". </p>
            <p>As the team leader, I experienced most fierce mind collision to other three memebers with different backgrounds. I learned to think from different angles.

            </h3>
            <p><em>"15 Minutes of Biometric Fame"</em> is a project which tries to blend the art and technology together. A camera is mounted at one end of the crane to capture human faces in the exhibition hall. If it finds a face, the system will search a similar face with the faces database which includes many celebrity’s face data. If a match is found, they both your face and the matched celebrity’s face and relative descriptions would be projected on a large display which would give ordinary people a chance to be a celebrity in a few minutes over the course of which the robot will move with the people.

            I mainly focused on programming to control and coordinate motions of different parts (e.g. arms and wheels). Through the project, I broaden my horizon with some mechanical engineering knowledge.

           Experiencing the MIT Media Lab "Trackmate" 
            </h3>
            <p>
            Interested in tangible user interface, I set up the <a href="http://trackmate.sourceforge.net/">trackmate</a> system in my dormitory. After experiencing this tangible UI, several things just came out of mind.</p>
            <p><h3>Comments:</h3>
            <p>It is pretty easy to set up and really friendly for prototying tangible UI. However, from my own experience, I felt: 1) The accuracy of tracking decreases rapidly while under insufficent light environment (e.g. in the evening under lamp). 2)The small view field of camera makes the interaction surface relatively limeted.</p>
