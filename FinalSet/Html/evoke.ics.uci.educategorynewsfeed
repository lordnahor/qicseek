				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Along with Sara Hendren (Harvard), Geof will be a speaker in the PROGRAM series at NYU organized by the departments of <a href="http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/mcc/">Media, Culture and Communication</a>, <a href="http://english.fas.nyu.edu/page/home">English</a>, and <a href="http://complit.as.nyu.edu/page/home">Comparative Literature</a>. More event details can be found <a href="http://www.programseries.com/events/values-in-technological-design/">here</a>. </p>
<p><strong><em>Values in Technological Design</em></strong><br />
Abstract:<br />
The goal for many designers of technology is to produce objects that are useful, but whose use is not dictated by the object design itself. Computers in particular are flexible technologies, and can be programmed to suit a wide variety of functions and needs. Yet despite these goals of technological neutrality, the design of technical objects often shapes their use, and can have far-reaching political, social, and cultural consequences. This event investigates the ways in which values become embodied in technological design and what efforts we might make to address such structures.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Geof will be speaking as part of the <a href="http://www.si.umich.edu/newsandevents/event/yahoo-lecture-series-geoffrey-bowker">Yahoo! Lecture Series</a> at the <a href="http://www.si.umich.edu/">University of Michigan&#8217;s School of Information</a> on April 10, 2013. </p>
<p><strong><em>The End of the Article</em></strong><br />
Abstract:<br />
In this talk, I analyze the development of the scientific article as the coin of the realm for the transmission of knowledge.  I argue that the database, over the past 200 years, has grown into a form of transmission and exploration which has been largely under-recognized.  I then discuss examples of new forms of knowledge expression which both deploy databases more effectively and move from a largely logocentric model to one engaging a wider set of senses.  Finally, I explore the possibilities for developing these new forms within the academy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>
<strong>Friday February 22 &#8211; Sunday February 24</strong></p>
<p><strong>Location: Borrego Springs, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anza-Borrego_Desert" title="Anza-Borrego Desert" target="_blank">Anza-Borrego Desert</a>, exact location TBA</strong></p>
<p>Doctoral students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty from across California are invited to the inaugural Southern California Winter STS retreat. This retreat is being organized under the auspices of the UC Irvine STS Initiative, funded by the Office of Research, and the EVoKE Lab at UC Irvine.</p>
<p>This retreat is designed for a select group of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty advance their research projects in the field of STS, broadly defined, and in so doing to advance an emergent set of problematics and topical foci in STS itself. The emphasis will be on intellectual play. It is not intended to be a training workshop, and graduate students will be expected to participate in the same manner as other participants. Collectively, we will explore each others’ topics through a series of focused discussions as well as small-group engagements with the Anza-Borrego environment. It is <span style="text-decoration: underline">not</span> expected that participants necessarily be interested in the study of desert ecosystems, etc.; we will use the local context to stimulate new ways of thinking that we can apply to our own research projects.</p>
<p>STS is to be taken here as an umbrella rather than a fence: work in cognate disciplines (informatics, anthropology, design, etc.) that deploys and engages with STS work is considered part of the mix. We will bring together up to 30 graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty for this three-day retreat. There will be two foci: (1) identifying and exploring common interests through two “spotlight” sessions; and (2) exploring these themes through teams exploring the local area. Accommodation for all will be covered; travel will be covered in exceptional circumstances for students. A registration fee of $100 is required. Since space is limited, there will be a selection process: please send a CV and a one-page statement of interest <a href="mailto:steveslota@gmail.com">to steveslota@gmail.com </a>by<span style="text-decoration: underline"> December 15, 2012</span>. The statement of interest should briefly address the research in progress that you would like to further through participation in the workshop. Those selected to participate in the workshop will be notified by January 1. They will be expected to circulate a two-page description of a current or prospective project by February 1.</p>
