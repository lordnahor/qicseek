		<description><![CDATA[Hi Prof Jain,
          It&#039;s an interesting thought. It looks challenging though, as to how to involve human users beyond the evaluation stages of a media application. Maybe in feature selection, optimisation criteria selection or even algorithm selection, I don&#039;t know how though. Otherwise it seems difficult to have a nice impedence matching as you said if people can only define the problem rougly in the beginning like &quot;search for a rose&quot; and then just evaluate the system&#039;s final result. Which in many cases wouldn&#039;t match what the user had in mind.]]></description>
