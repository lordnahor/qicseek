		<description><![CDATA[My thoughts on managing digital photos hinge on a couple basic premises;
- the original file is immutable. (any edits of it lose information)
- the destination file is immutable. (assuming that lossy compression is used)

This implies that that handling digital images should involve &#039;recipes&#039; or &#039;routes&#039; which tell how to create a destination image from a source.

I think this model holds advantages for both hobby and professional photographers.  A hobbyist can use existing recipes, a pro has no problem increasing the gamma of these 400 images by 25%.

Some editing elements would be easy to parameratize; cropping, resizing, color and brightness adjust ... others would be challenging or impractical ie. cloning.

I think that a management system based on these principles could be very useful and powerful.

Thanks,
Kent]]></description>
