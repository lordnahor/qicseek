Windows into Geometric Events: Data Structures for Time-Windowed
Querying of Temporal Point Sets
</h1>
<h2>

<p>
We study geometric data structures for sets of point-based temporal
events, such as geo-tagged scientific observations, sporting actions, or
disaster responses, so as to answer real-time time-windowed queries,
each of which is specified by a range of event times,
[<i>t</i><sub>1</sub>,<i>t</i><sub>2</sub>], and a
geometric question to be answered for the contiguous subsequence of
point events with time stamps in this range. In particular, we consider
time-windowed queries for skylines in &#8477;<sup><i>d</i></sup> and
convex hulls in &#8477;<sup>2</sup>. For
skyline problems, we provide a data structure using near-linear space
and preprocessing that can report the skyline in time proportional to
its size. For convex hull problems, we provide a data structures using
near-linear space and preprocessing that can in polylogarithmic time
answer various convex hull queries, including gift wrapping, hull
reporting, tangent finding, linear programming, line decision, line
stabbing, membership, and containment.
