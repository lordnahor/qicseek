I think everyone should have a right for the information and information technology with social networking techniques should be possible for anyone.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With so many companies, hospitals and schools replenishing old computer systems for new. There are plenty of computers that could be giving to less fortunate people or countries. The problem in some cases would be the lack of power and above all the lack of access to the internet.

Social networks or any other internet median would be a lost cause in this case BUT with access to the internet. This would be most definately something worth persueing.]]></description>

Having friends and travelled to many of these countries I realized that there are so many talented people in these countries it is too bad so many do not realize this. It will be great to see more people connected this way.]]></description>
