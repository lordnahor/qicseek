<p>Check back here every day or so.  I will generally post important coursewide announcements here.  They will be listed in reverse-chronological order (i.e., newest items first).</p>

<table class="normal">
  <tr class="top">
    <td>Date&nbsp;Added</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Th 1/23</td>
    <td>The <a href="CodeExamples">code example</a> we started in today's lecture is up in a completed form &mdash; not quite the same we ended up writing it in class, but still a good indication of how you might approach a problem like this.</td>

    <td>Tu 1/21</td>
    <td>Today's <a href="CodeExamples">code example</a> is now available, along with <a href="ProjectGuide/Project2">Project #2</a>.  Note that tomorrow's labs are when you'll be selecting your partner for <a href="ProjectGuide/Project2">Project #2</a>, so you'll want to attend; see an email sent to the class mailing list for more details.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Tu 1/21</td>
    <td>We now have our fifth TA, so our TAs have finally been definitively assigned to labs for the duration of the quarter; see the <a href="CourseReference.html">Course Reference</a> for more details.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>F 1/17</td>
    <td>The "echo client" we wrote in yesterday's lecture &mdash; taken a couple of steps further than we had time to go &mdash; is now available as a <a href="CodeExamples">code example</a>.</td>

    <td>Sa 1/11</td>
    <td>The <a href="CodeExamples">code example</a> I posted yesterday had two minor bugs in both <b>print_lines.py</b> and <b>line_count.py</b>.  Both had spacing inconsistencies that caused them not to run.  I've posted fixed versions in place of the old ones.</td>

      <p>Welcome!  Please note a couple of things as we get started this quarter:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The first lecture will meet on Tuesday, January 7.  Lab sections begin meeting on Monday, January 13.  For more information about meeting times of lab sections, see the <a href="CourseReference.html">Course Reference</a>.  For information about lecture material and readings, see the <a href="Schedule.html">Schedule</a>.</li>
        <li>I encourage you to spend some time reading through the material on the course web site.  It will be updated periodically throughout the quarter, and there will always be an announcement here describing each update.  For now, notice the set of links at the top of this (and every) page, leading you to the <a href="CourseReference.html">Course Reference</a>, the <a href="Schedule.html">Schedule</a>, and the <a href="ProjectGuide">Project Guide</a>, as well as a set of <a href="CodeExamples">Code Examples</a> &mdash; mostly emanating from the lectures &mdash; that will be posted throughout the quarter.</li>
        <li>For those of you planning on using your own machines for at least some of your work, it might be worth spending some time working through <a href="ProjectGuide/Assignment0">Assignment #0</a>, which provides instructions on getting the necessary software installed and configured.  (Read the <a href="ProjectGuide">Project Guide</a> page first, for some context on the necessary software and some background on what we're going to be doing.)</li>
      </ul>
