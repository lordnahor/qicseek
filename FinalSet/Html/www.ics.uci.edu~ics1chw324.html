<LI><A NAME="QQ1"><B> As a political science major (and an ardent Democrat) 
with an emphasis in public policy issues on a national level, where can I 
find any information on Bill Clinton and what conservatives in the nation think 
about what the administration is currently doing?</B></A><br>
 My answer is a subscription to the outspoken publication: 
<I>The Washington Weekly</I>. Unfortunately, this publication can only be 
read after a  costly payment of $7.95 for 20 issues. Nevertheless, <I>The  
Washington  Weekly </I> is available for all interested readers  through Internet on  
Gopher (dolphin.gulf.net,     port    70)   
and   the   World-Wide   Web (http://dolphin.gulf.net/).  <A HREF= 
"gopher://dolphin.gulf.net:3000/hh/">The CONTENTS</A> of the publication are available for public use at no cost. 
Besides this source of political information from the conservatives of 
this country, one can also find a more factual account of White House 
ongoings through <A HREF= 
"http://english-server.hss.cmu.edu/WhiteHouse.html"> White House Watch.</A>

<LI><A NAME="QQ2"><B> What are the names of all the UCI faculty 
within the political science department, and how can I contact them on 
e-mail?</B></A><br>
The names of all the UCI political science faculty members are always available in the 
UCI catalogs in hard copy. For those that would rather sift through the Web to acquire
the names of faculty, their areas of emphasis, e-mail addresses, and possible pictures, 
the <A HREF="http://www.socsci.uci.edu/pol/personnel/fac.html"><B>Political Science 
Department has a Home Page </B></A> just for those interests! Some of the more
well-known 
faculty members include Professor James Danziger, former Chair of the Department of 
Political Science and current Chair of the Academic Senate; Professor David Easton
who is credited for developing the basic jargon associated with the study of poltical
science; and Professor Mark Petracca who has always remained in the public eye with
countless columns in newspapers as well as television appearances. For more general 
information on the department, including sources on the undergraduate and graduate 
programs, <A HREF="http://www.socsci.uci.edu/pol/pol.html"><B>Click here.</B></A>

<LI><A NAME="QQ3"><B>I will be travelling to Russia this summer. 
Where can I get information on Russian culture including some examples of 
Russian literature, art, and obscenities?</B></A><br>
To become more familiar with some Russsian culture, there are three sources
that would provide interesting and humorous information. To become more 
familiar with political literature on the current debates ensuing in
Russia, one can scan the contents of <A HREF="http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/slavrev/fall94/toc.web">
<I><B>Slavic Review</B></I></A>. Some articles discuss topics such as national identity in
Russia, parliamentary elections, and book reviews. Beyond current social and
political issues within the country, one can become familiar with the culture by
scanning the Internet Art Galleries which include an <A 
HREF="http://www.kiae.su/www/wtr/hotpictures/gallery.html"><B>Electronic PhotoGallery</B></A>
featuring the work of Russsian artists such as Alexander Kholopov and Boris Mikhailov.
Lastly, to genuinely familiarize oneself to the country, some working knowledge
of <A HREF= " gopher://infomeister.osc.edu:74/11/russian/obscenities"><B> Russian obscenties
</B></A> is almost a 
must! <p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ4"><B> I wish I had actually read Vannevar Bush so 
that I would have done a bit better on Quiz #1. Unfortunately, I lost the 
hard copy of the article, but I am just aching to read all about him. 
Where can I find his article?</B></A><br>
The article,<A HREF= "http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/VBush.html.Z"><B> "As We May Think,"</B></A> 
written by Vannevar Bush is located 
within the References section of the ICS 1C Home Pages. His article has been used to cite the origin 
of artificial intelligence and multimedia. Bush brings to the public eye in this
brief work the notion that in some respects computers can be made to become
very similar to the human mind. His article discusses the nature within which information
is disseminated and how this information can be made accessible through computer
organization. Other <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/refs.html"><B> references </B></A>
within the course are also available.

<LI><A NAME="QQ5"><B>Where can I find a sample document in HTML 
format to give me a good idea as to how to create my own document?</B></A><br>
 The most useful <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/sample.html"><B>
HTML Sample</B></A> is within the Reference Section in the ICS Home Pages.
This reference outlines in basic terms the meaning of Hypertext Markup Language
and the basic structure of an HTML document. There are eight HTML References available
in the HomePages including <A 
HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Internet/WWW/HTMLPrimer.html">NCSA's 
Beginner's Guide to HTML</A> and <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/html-jpowell/">
James Powell's Introduction to HTML.</A> In these documents, one can find information on acronym
expansion, creating HTML documents, basic markup language, additional markup language,
structuring titles, headings, and paragraphs.
