<LI><h2><B>Introduction</B></h2>
<p>
What is the first image of <A 
HREF="http://www.ntt.jp:80/japan/map/">Japan</A>? You would say a small country, 
expensive to live, a great economic power, etc. The last characteristics 
of <A 
HREF="http://www.ntt.jp:80/japan/map/">Japan</A> is deeply related to 
Japanese education. The academic 
achievement of Japanese students is pretty high. For example, in 1986 94 
% of students who graduated from lower-secondary school entered 
upper-secondary school. That is pretty similar to that of <A 
HREF="http://wings.buffalo.edu/world/usa.html">the United 
States</A>. 35 % of them continued on to University, which is lower than 
that of <A
HREF="http://wings.buffalo.edu/world/usa.html">the United
States</A> but higher than 
that of west <A HREF="http://wings.buffalo.edu/world/europe.html">European 
countries</A>(<A 
HREF="#b1">bib.1</A>). This 
high ratio of Japanese education has helped  <A 
HREF="http://www.ntt.jp:80/japan/map/">Japan</A> develop so much, but at 
the same time she has many problems concerning <A 
HREF="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/homes/mcbryan/public_html/bb/38/summary.html">education</A>. 
<p>
<LI><h2><B>General Information</B></h2>
<p>
Educational system in <A
HREF="http://www.ntt.jp:80/japan/map/">Japan</A> is basically 6-3-3-4; 6 
years of elementary 
school, 3 years of each lower and upper secondary schools, and usually 4 
years of college. Some people go to 2 year junior college where 90% of 
students are women. And there are many other institutions. Special 
training schools which offer students special skills, such as "<A 
HREF="http://unhinfo.unh.edu/1m/unh/acad/cats/grad/grad.cs">computer 
science</A>" and "vocational training", and Miscellaneous schools where they 
can learn various kinds of subjects(<A 
HREF="#b2">bib.2</A>).
<p>
<A 
HREF="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/homes/mcbryan/public_html/bb/38/summary.html">Education</A> in 
<A
HREF="http://www.ntt.jp:80/japan/map/">Japan</A> is free and compulsory 
from the 1st grade through the 
9th grade. Schools go by trimester system, and students are supposed to 
attend school for at least 210 days. School year usually begins in April 
and ends in March. They have to go to school Monday through Friday, and 
one-half day on Saturdays. Right now they are considering if they take a 
day off on Saturday or not in public shcool(<A HREF="#b1">bib.1</A>,<A 
HREF="#b2">bib.2</A>). 
<p>
Private schools started playing an important role in education especially 
in upper-secondary schools. Most of the elementary schools are virtually 
public school. Private elementary schools are less than 1%. However, when 
it comes to lower and upper secondary schools, the ratio goes up to 5% 
for lower-secondary school and 24% for all upper-secondary schools. There 
is a tendency that private schools take care of students in terms of 
studying a lot more than public schools(<A
HREF="#b2">bib.2</A>).
<p>
<LI><h2><B>Problems of Japanese <A 
HREF="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/homes/mcbryan/public_html/bb/38/summary.html">Education</A> 
System--<A HREF="http://txfs1.hfb.se/general.html">college entrance 
examinations</A></h2></B> 
<p>
<B>3.1.Memorization</B>
<p>
First of all, one of the biggest issues of Japanese <A 
HREF="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/homes/mcbryan/public_html/bb/38/summary.html">education</A> is 
<A HREF="http://txfs1.hfb.se/general.html">college entrance
exams</A>. That drives everybody crazy especially last year in 
upper-secondary school. Because of that they have to spend much time on 
studying useless things. A key word for studying is "memorization" which 
won't stay on their mind for a long, and which doesn't help them acquire 
anything important. In the case of history ,for instance, they have to 
memorize all the year when something important happened. that is it. They 
don't go into depth for that. They just cover the surface of 
history(<A HREF="#b2">bib.2</A>). 
<p>
<B>3.2.Limited Subjects</B>
<p>
Since subjects which are tested in the exams are decided in advance, most 
of the students only study those subjects instead of their intersets. 
There is definitely lack of choices and little effort is made for that. 
That is seriously killing various personalities for each person(<A 
HREF="#b1">bib.1</A>, <A HREF="#b2">bib.2</A>). 
<p>
<B>3.3.Poor <A HREF="http://www.arts.cuhk.hk/Lit.html">English</A></B>
<p>
Although Japanese students spend a lot of time on studying <A 
HREF="http://www.arts.cuhk.hk/Lit.html">English</A>, most 
of them can't use it practically. In lower and upper secondary school 
they focus on mostly grammar and readings which occupy most of the part 
on <A HREF="http://www.arts.cuhk.hk/Lit.html">English</A> exams. They study 
<A HREF="#http://www.arts.cuhk.hk/Lit.html">English</A> only for that. 
That is why there are 
so many Japanese who can't communicate in <A 
HREF="http://www.arts.cuhk.hk/Lit.html">English</A>. Besides, there are 
few teachers who can speak <A 
HREF="http://www.arts.cuhk.hk/Lit.html">English</A> 
well at school, and basically 
they are lacking in native <A 
HREF="http://www.arts.cuhk.hk/Lit.html">English</A> 
speakers(<A HREF="#b2">bib.2</A>, <A HREF="#b3">bib.3</A>). 
<p>
<B>3.4.Cram School="Yobiko"</B>
<p>
This kind of college entrance examinations increase the number of 
students who go to cram schools called "Yobiko" which help students 
prepare for entrance exams. So basically many students go to both regular 
school and Yobiko just to get in a college. Actually Yobico is more 
famous for those who didn't enter any college previous year. They are 
called "Ronin", and to be a Ronin at least for a year is very common 
especially among men. Ronin occupy about 40% of college entrance, which 
is very large amount. That shows how competitive the college entrance is. 
There are some who spend more than 5 years as Ronin, which seems like 
real waste of time. Those kind of people are dying for one vary famous 
university, most of the case, <A 
HREF="http://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/">University of Tokyo</A>(<A 
HREF="#b2">bib.2</A>). <p> <B>3.5.Connection to job</B>
<p>
The reason why so many people care about particular Universities is 
because it has much to do with tehir future jobs. There is a very close linkage 
between University background and employment. If they want to work for 
big 1st-rank company, the most important things for them is not what 
they studied in college but the fact that they graduated from certain 
prestigious University. Especially private sector doesn't expect 
University graduates to learn something special at college. They would 
rather train them by their own way, and make them fit in their own 
sector(<A HREF="#b1">bib.1</A>). 
<p>
<B>3.6.Big Influence from Future Job</B>
<p>
For the final purpose to get a good job, competition of <A 
HREF="http://txfs1.hfb.se/general.html">college entrance
exams</A> 
became keen and harsh. That aslo affects <A 
HREF="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/homes/mcbryan/public_html/bb/38/summary.html">education</A> 
system in both 
lower and upper secondary schools. Nowadays even elementary schools have 
been influenced by that, and they are forced to study for getting in good 
school which has good education system for entering 1st-rank 
colleges(<A HREF="#b2">bib.2</A>). 
<p>
<B>3.7.Japanese Students from Overseas and Foreign Students</B>
<p>
In this stressful situation, another problem is coming up. That is the 
case for those who spent many years outside of Japan. When they come back 
to Japan, they will have some problems to fit in school especially in 
lower and upper secondary school. Unless they go to oversea Japanese 
school, they will be far behind in the class, and it is so hard for them 
to get in college through regular examinations. Since they are lacking in
English-speak teachers, and many of the students are studying for 
entering good schools, it would be difficult for them to follow the 
school system in Japan. Thus, many of them tend to go to either American 
school or International school(<A HREF="#b5">bib.5</A>). 
<p>
<LI><h2><B>Conclusion</B></h2>
<p>
In order to solve those problems, some reforms have been conducted. 
Through those reforms the National Council on <A 
HREF="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/homes/mcbryan/public_html/bb/38/summary.html">Education</A> Reform introduce 
some new proposals. First of all, internationalization is an issue for 
every <A 
HREF="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/homes/mcbryan/public_html/bb/38/summary.html">education</A> 
level, especially for higher <A 
HREF="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/homes/mcbryan/public_html/bb/38/summary.html">education</A>. 
Life 
long <A 
HREF="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/homes/mcbryan/public_html/bb/38/summary.html">education</A> 
which allows adult people to have <A 
HREF="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/homes/mcbryan/public_html/bb/38/summary.html">education</A> is 
also a principal proposal, such as expansion of University entrance 
opportunities. There is a need for improvement of teaching foreign 
languages, particularly <A 
HREF="http://www.arts.cuhk.hk/Lit.html">English</A>. 
The government invited many 
native <A HREF="http://www.arts.cuhk.hk/Lit.html">English</A> speakers to 
improve spoken <A HREF="http://www.arts.cuhk.hk/Lit.html">English</A> for 
Japanese. The most controversial issue here is the harsh <A 
HREF="http://txfs1.hfb.se/general.html">college entrance  
examinations</A>. The 
ministry urged Universities to have more substitute for the exams, such 
as admission by recomendation, admission by special skills, admission for 
those who returned from overseas and who want to keep studying years 
after they graduated. If the system of the exams changes, there will be 
more selection of subjects which they can study instead of 
memorization, and acceptance for foreign students will become easier, too. 
Even though there is little evidence for that so far, hopefully those 
changes have been happening step by step(<A HREF="#b1">bib1</A>, <A 
HREF="#b2">bib2</A>, <A HREF="#b4">bib4</A>, <A HREF="#b5">bib5</A>).
