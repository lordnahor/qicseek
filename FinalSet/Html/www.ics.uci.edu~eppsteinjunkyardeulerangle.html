<h1>Euler's Formula,
Proof 8: Sum of Angles
</H1>

This proof uses the fact that the planar graph formed by the polyhedron
can be embedded so all edges form straight line segments.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Sum up the angles in each face of a straight line drawing of the graph
(including the outer face); the sum of angles in a <I>k</I>-gon is
(<I>k</I>-2)pi, and each edge contributes to two faces, so the total sum
is (2E-2F)pi.
<P>
Now let's count the same angles the other way.
Each interior vertex is surrounded by triangles and contributes a total
angle of 2 pi to the sum.
The vertices on the outside face contribute 2(pi - theta(v)).
where theta denotes the exterior angle of the polygon.
The total exterior angle of any polygon is 2 pi,
so the total angle is 2 pi V - 4 pi.
<P>
Combining these two formulas and dividing through by 2 pi,
we see that V - 2 = E - F, or equivalently V-E+F=2.

This is the method used by Descartes in 1630.
<a href="refs.html#Som">Sommerville</a> attributes this proof to
<a href="refs.html#Lhu">Lhuilier</a> and
<a href="refs.html#Ste">Steiner</a>.
<a href="refs.html#HilPed">Hilton and Pederson</a> use angles in a similar way
to relate the Euler characteristic of a polyhedral surface
to its <I>total angular defect</I>.
