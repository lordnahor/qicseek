To expose them to some entrepreneurs, I will have some guests who will share their experience and will help students.
This calss is not big -- about 20 students.  I think that is the right size for such a class.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I took an entrepreneurism class in college, and I loved it. It sounds like your class is larger than mine was (I had only 20 or so), but our assignment at the end of the semester was to present a business plan and product (even a fake product) to a small panel of venture capitalists and then field their questions.

It was great experience to write up our own business plans and think through market size, potential, strategy and the like. Most of our products were imaginary, but we all learned alot by writing up our plans and presenting. I&#039;d highly recommend it if the class is small enough.]]></description>
