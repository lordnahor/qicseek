  <p class="participant"><a name="Freeman"></a>Peter Freeman</p>
<p>Peter A. Freeman 
  became Assistant Director for the Computer and Information Science and Engineering 
  Directorate (CISE) on May 6, 2002.</p>
<p>Dr. Freeman was 
  previously at Georgia Institute of Technology as professor and founding Dean 
  of the College of Computing since 1990. He served in that capacity as the John 
  P. Imlay, Jr. Dean of Computing, holding the first endowed Dean's Chair at Georgia 
  Tech. He was in charge of the FutureNet Project, part of the campus technology 
  preparations for the 1996 Olympic Village, that resulted in a very high-performance 
  and broad campus network. In 1998, he chaired the Sam Nunn NationsBank Policy 
  Forum on Information Security which lead to the creation of the Georgia Tech 
  Information Security Center, one of the first comprehensive centers in the country 
  focused on information security.</p>
<p>During 1989-90 
  Dr. Freeman was Visiting Distinguished Professor of Information Technology at 
  George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, and from 1987 to 1989 he served 
  as Division Director for Computer and Computation Research at the National Science 
  Foundation. He served on the faculty of the Department of Information and Computer 
  Science at the University of California, Irvine, for almost twenty years before 
  coming to Georgia Tech.</p>
<p>Dr. Freeman was 
  a member of the Board of Directors of the Computing Research Association (1988-2002), 
  serving as Vice-Chair and Chair of the Government Affairs Committee. He was 
  a member of select review committees of the IRS and FAA Air-traffic Control 
  modernization efforts, and has served on a variety of national and regional 
  committees. While at NSF, he helped formulate the High-Performance Computing 
  and Communications Initiative of the Federal government. </p>
<p>Dr. Freeman is 
  a Fellow of the IEEE (Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers), AAAS 
  (American Association for the Advancement of Science), and the ACM (Association 
  for Computing Machinery). He received his Ph.D. in computer science from Carnegie-Mellon 
  University in 1970, his M.A. in mathematics and psychology from the University 
  of Texas at Austin in 1965, and his B.S. in physics from Rice University in 
  1963. His research and technical expertise has focused on software systems and 
  their creation. His earliest work (1961-63) involved developing advanced scientific 
  applications in the days before there were operating systems and other support 
  software. This led him to design and build one of the earliest interactive time-sharing 
  operating systems (1964) and ultimately to early work applying artificial intelligence 
  to the design process for software (1965-75). This culminated with the publication 
  of his first book, Software System Principles (SRA, 1975).</p>
<p>After a short stint 
  teaching overseas for the United Nations, he focused his work on software engineering, 
  ultimately being recognized for this early work by being elected a Fellow of 
  the IEEE. Along with Prof. A. I. Wasserman, he developed one of the first software 
  design courses (taken by thousands of industry practitioners) and published 
  a highly popular text that served as a first introduction to software engineering. 
  His research during this period focused on reusable software, especially using 
  formal transformation systems. That work has resulted in several startup companies.</p>

<p>My research mainly 
  concerns the social organization and social consequences of science and technology. 
  I am currently engaged in two projects. The first, funded by a grant from the 
  National Science Foundation, is a longitudinal study of the organization and 
  dynamics of research groups in science and engineering. The study is concerned 
  with how groups grow and change over time, what factors influence performance, 
  and how changes in the resource and research environments influence group dynamics. 
  The second study is concerned with the social distribution of environmental 
  hazards, and how such hazards and the associated scientific principles are understood 
  by ordinary people.<br>
