The U.S. Agency for International Development dispatched 21 people to assess the disaster and decide what kind of assistance would be needed. USAID has stored emergency supplies in the Philippines and the United Arab Emirates and is already shipping out items that will be needed, including water bladders to transport fresh water, plastic sheeting for temporary shelters, and food, said J. Edward Fox, assistant administrator for the agency.
