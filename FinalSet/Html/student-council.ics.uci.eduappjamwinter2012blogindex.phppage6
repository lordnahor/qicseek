<p>Current Progress status:<br />
Today we all met up around 8:00 and started working on the implementation of our app. We have divided up the tasks and have set a schedule for meeting up for the rest of the week.</p>
<p>Progress Today:<br />
We have begun coding the major parts of our app. Today we started working on the user interface, implemented google maps, and uploading data to mySLQ.</p>
<p>Challenges:<br />
Although we have made a lot of progress implementing the individual components of our app, we need to start integrating as a system.</p>

<span class="submitted">February 29, 2012 &#8212; Team10 </span>

<div class="content">
<p><strong>Current Project Status:<br />
</strong><br />
The app is still in the alpha stages, meaning we have not yet implemented all of the major features to a degree to be tested. The basic layout of the application is set in place, with actions/events allowing us to traverse through the different parts of the app.  The server side of the app is up and running with basic communication features with client application. Overall, the app is still in a crude form and not visually appealing. However we have made vast leaps in progress, while have learned and discovered much about developing an Android app. These steps of progress will be explained in the sections below.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Today:</strong></p>
<p><em>Android (Client Side):</em><br />
As explained above, the basic layout and flow of the application is in placed. Every major path from and Activity screen to another Activity screen is in place, and we are able to traverse through the app as planned. The client side team has learned how to implement many exciting features of Android: Scrollable Views, AlertDialogs, Keyboard/Input. To reiterate, the skeleton of the app is there, the next thing to do is fill it with our with content.</p>
<p><em>DataBase/Server:<br />
</em>A software design document was created to fully plan out the data flow specifics of the server and pseudocode was created for all the methods that the server will contain. The database schema was also defined. Implementation of this design is now well underway.</p>
<p><em>Design:<br />
</em>We are currently working on the graphic designs for the app to make it as aesthetically pleasing as possible. With a mixture of android graphics and our own illustrations, we hope to create an environment for the app that users will love to use. With the help of the client team, we might even have a few customizable options for users.<br />
<strong><br />
Challenges:</strong></p>
<p>As for the client team, a major challenge was to focus on developing the major features and not concentrate on &#8220;polishing&#8221; the app. As computer science majors, it is hard-wired into our brains to be neat and complete. We are trained to hone in on all the small details and to make every button, view, functionality, etc perfect. However, we should instead be concentrating on finishing the major features of the app, and &#8220;polish&#8221; in the beta stages.</p>

<div class="content">
<p>As the third day of the Android AppJam comes to a close, I have to say that the team is doing <strong>great</strong>!</p>
<p>Each of us has assigned tasks, and because of the wonder of version control, we can all work on separate files, and as updates happen, we share, see the changes, and keep working.</p>
<p>How <em>exactly </em>are we working? Starting from viewing the drawing board in a semi-circular fashion to complete the UI design, and moving to individual seats to create the stubs, we had finalized in a wonderful pair-programming equilibrium.</p>
<p>Even though we had problems with merging conflicts eventually, we had a lot of good work involving design and initial coding that was done.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait to meet tomorrow!</p>

<p>Current Project Status:<br />
We are in the process implementing a Google Map integration, MySQL integration, and a UI.</p>
<p>Progress Today:<br />
Today, we finialized our idea on our app. We also designed and implemented a rough UI. We shared the project containing our app with each other using Saros. At the end of the meeting we split tasks for each member to do for the app.</p>
<p>Challenges:</p>
<p>One challenge we had was agreeing on finalizing an idea for the app. Another challenge was that when we used Saros to share the project with each other for some reason we were unable to see the graphical layout of the xml files containing the UI.</p>

<span class="submitted">February 29, 2012 &#8212; Team2 </span>

<div class="content">
<p><strong>Current Status:</strong><br />
We have created most of the underlying framework for our app and done a bit of work on the UI. Our app idea is pretty much fully fleshed out, we just need to finish coding it. We hope to finish most of the primary functions of the app by the end of day 4 so we can use days 5 and 6 for cleaning it up, making it look good, and making sure everything works right.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Today:</strong><br />
We met today at 11:00 on campus. Our first steps for today were to solidify our ideas for the app, and get a basic framework and setup ready for everyone to work on. Then we split up to work on three separate tasks that would be needed for the app to function: a major UI element to be implemented in several places, a way to store app data on the phone, and a way to communicate with the database. Each of these tasks encountered problems, but we were able to come up with solutions and get a significant portion of each of these features done before finally calling it a night and each going off to work on our own to finish things up. Tomorrow we will meet again to combine these features and create a UI that utilizes them.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong><br />
One of our challenges today was figuring out how best to split up the work. After making a decision on that, we ran into several problems, mostly due to the fact that we are learning how to use the android platform as we work with it. For a while we couldn&#8217;t communicate with our webserver, were unable to use the files we saved on the phone, and were having trouble switching between UI screens in the app. Also, one of our members was having trouble getting the app to run on his computer. However, we were able to fix each of these issues by the end of the day, and are making good progress.</p>

<p>Current Project Status:  Design is essentially finished, with room to be flexible as development progresses. We are ready to start programming tomorrow which is our first heavy work day.</p>
<p>Progress Today:  Today was full of schedule conflicts/work/projects/etc. so our group did not meet today. We had decided ahead of time that we would most likely not meet today so that we could use any extra time we had today to focus on other school work we needed to get done this week so that we could better focus on App Jam on Thursday when our schedules lined up much better. (Essentially today was &#8220;if you have anything you need to do tomorrow, do it today so tomorrow is free&#8221;).</p>
<p>Challenges: Schedule conflicts led to solution above.</p>

<p>Current Project Status:</p>
<p>We have expanded on our ideas but we are still compromising design details for our program. We have an idea of the flow and layout of the app but need to decide on content within the individual Activities.</p>
<p>Progress Today:</p>
<p>Met again today in the evening. We finalized everyone&#8217;s work environments and made sure we could all perform the appropriate Git actions.  We tried to focus more of our time today on programming and implementation. This led to identifying discrepancies within certain design elements. It allowed us to alter our design enough to maintain consistency between components and cleared up misunderstandings about other components.</p>
<p>Challenges:</p>
<p>Although realizing certain design flaws early helped us out, it made us realize just how much thought needs to be put within every feature and component of the app. Furthermore, we will try to maintain good communication within the group and stay focused on what is most necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Current Status:</strong></p>
<p>Currently, each team member have been assigned a specific task. Someone is writing the code UI, while another team member is working on the database, another is working on the mapping/gps code, and another is working on the algorithm. We plan to have a meeting on Thursday to show what we each of us have completed.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Today:</strong></p>
<p>We have begun coding, with major parts of the code either started on or half-way done. The beta version of the user interface is done, the database and the algorithm is still in progress. For the algorithm, we have to do some research about the field and the audience we are targeting. We have also been working on the framework of the app as well as collecting data for the app.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge:</strong></p>
<p>Two main challenges encountered thus far have been, developing an algorithm that encompasses the factors we want to measure, and the other challenge is implementing the mapping code with the user interface.</p>

<p><strong>Current Status:</strong><br />
We are still in research mode since several team members are still learning various different languages, like PHP and JSON. Meanwhile, others are trying to learn how to manually draw shapes and lines onto the screen. We already came up with the navigational flow of the app so we’ll try to stick to that plan as best as we can. We have subteams set up in order to most efficiently use the skills we all currently possess. The idea for the app is well thought out and now the implementation and coding of it is being strategized. There are many factors involved such as the Design, GUI Interface, Server synchronization, and programming.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.appjam.roboteater.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/PHP.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-608" src="http://blog.appjam.roboteater.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/PHP-300x133.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="133" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Progress Today:<br />
</strong>Team members are reporting good progress after reading several tutorials on web server administration. After we get webspace, we hope we can start applying what we learned right away. Vincent tried to implement zoom and translate functionality but failed and will try another approach. Then, he will attempt to draw various shapes on to the screen. The PHP part of the application and what is required was studied and is ultimately finished. The echo command is a very useful command in PHP <img src='http://student-council.ics.uci.edu/appjam/winter2012/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> . Various group members met throughout the day in the Science Library to brainstorm ideas on improvements and concerns. We also worked more on the coding and implementation of the base app. All team members installed Subclipse plugn as well as the AVD Device 4.0 to work on. Finally, we requested webspace to deploy PHP scripts which will be an integral part of our application.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong><br />
Currently designing the c2ddm implementation for our application is a challenge and will require some time and effort. The preliminary JSON format is still being decided. Also the actual implementation of the program, meaning the code, obviously is still being written and worked on. Zoom/translating a view is proving harder than we thought.</p>
