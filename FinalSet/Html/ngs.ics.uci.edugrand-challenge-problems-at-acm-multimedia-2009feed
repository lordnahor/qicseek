		<description><![CDATA[Hi Christian (and Ramesh!),

Everybody is invited to join - the current set of companies are a some of the of companies we approached, and some of them had approached us. In any case, it&#039;s not too late for companies to pose their own challenges.

Unfortunately, even if we have 20 or 2000 additional companies, I still do not think we&#039;ll cover all of the world&#039;s Multimedia problems :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would agree on this statement, very innovative and I&#039;m also happy looking forward to the results. However, I hope that some more challenges are coming soon as, for example, for multimedia communication I don&#039;t see video conferencing as the main/only issue. This may be the result that only some companies have used this opportunity while others have been excluded??? *very provocative written* ;-) ... or simply are not aware of that ... or ignoring it.]]></description>
