Hi,
 Saw your posting at Worldconnect and was wondering if you might know more
 about Marge Miller, daughter of Phillip and Dora, married to an unknown
 Langsam. Interestingly, in my family, there are Millers descended from a
 Pesach Langsam. Do you have the time or inclination to explore this any
 further?
 I have a website at
 www.langsam.com

I found Wilma Miller Wolfenstein.  I hadn't communicated with her in about
15 years but remembered that she lived in the Pittsburgh PA area and
fortunately, she still does.  Her husband's name is Lincoln Wolfenstein and
they are retired.  Their telephone number is 412-421-9666.  She was rather
actively involved in her family genealogy (mostly the Marcusson side, her
mother's surname) 10-15 years ago.  She was pleased to hear from me and is
still interested in genealogy.  I asked her a bit about the Millers and here
is what she told me:


Isaac Miller was from the Austro-Hungarian Empire and spoke Hungarian.  He
emigrated to Cleveland, OH about 1875.  He died in 1925.  His wife was
Carrie Green who died in 1920.  Carrie's father was from Frankfort-am-Mein
and emigrated to Cleveland about 1850.


Isaac and Carried had a son, Phillip, born in Cleveland in 1886.  In 1915,
he married Dora Marcusson (who was born in 1891).  He passed away in 1945
and she in 1932.  They had two children:
Wilma  born 1919  mar. Lincoln Wolfenstein


Marge  born ?? (I forgot to ask) who married Jerome Langsam.


She didn't at all seem to mind the questions but I wasn't sure how much more
to ask, except that Marge Langsam is still living.  Hope you find a
connection.  Feel free to contact Wilma for more info or for a telephone
number for her sister, Marge.  Unfortunately, Wilma says she is computer
illiterate but wonders if she could learn to use the Internet.  I suggested
she join a Pittsburgh genealogy society and get them to help her.  Perhaps
she will become more actively involved in genealogy.  Let me know if there
is more I can do and I am interested to learn if you find a connection.  I
took a look at your website - very excellent!  I have a very basic website
but no genealogy info on it.  I stay so busy gathering more info that I
struggle just to keep my genealogy database up-to-date.  Take care
