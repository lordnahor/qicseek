  #7: 2/4/13<br>
  Programming Assignment #1 Graded
</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
Programming Assignment #1 has been graded.
There are two files that you should download, unzip, and examine to understand
  you performance on this assignment and cumulative performance in this class.
<p>
<ul>
<li>The first stores the
   <a href="solutions/program1gradesstudents.zip">assignment grades</a>, a
   zipped Excel file that details how each student was graded on this
   instrument: why points were deducted.
You will see the deducted points in cells.
If you hover over a commented cell (those with a red-triangle in the cell's
  upper-right hand corner) you will see a comment that explains why the points
  were deducted.
This file is is sorted by your Unique ID.
<p>
<li>The second file to examine is the grades spreadsheet that is available from
   the index on the course web: it records all the grades for all the testing
   instruments that I assign over the quarter.
It is sorted likewise.
<p>
You will notice that in the second spreadsheet all numbers are rounded up to
  integers: so receiving a 77.5 on the first spreadsheet will translate to a 78
  on the second one.
We will use this same process for recording all grades during the quarter.
</ul>
<p>
This assignment was designed to test if you have mastered using the data types
  from the ICS46 Template library (stack, queue, priority queue, set, map) -and
  iterators over these data types.
You should have found it interesting that these different problems can be
  solved compactly with the same tools: these data types and iteration.
<p>
The class average was 77 (or about 97%) and the median was 82 (or about 103%).
There were 483 As, 13% Bs, 0% Cs, and 4% Ds and Fs.
Many submissions were early.
<p>
<b>IMPORTANT</b>
If you believe that we recorded one or more answers incorrectly, please
  see your TA during lab hours and tell him what you think the differences are.
Please read the comments in the <b>assignment grades</b> spreadsheet carefully
  <b>before</b> contacting your TA and ensure you understand the correct
  answers.
He will then re-examine issue, possibly asking you for more information if there
  is still confusion, or talking to you during the lab meeting.
If there is a difference, he will email me a revised summary about
  your program, and cc a copy to you.
I will update the grades spreadsheet as appropriate (it might take a bit of
  time for all these events to cumulate in a changed grade).
If you feel there is still a problem after talking to the TA, please
  contact me (but always contact the TA first).

  #6: 2/3/14<br>
  Quiz #3 Graded
</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
The TA has graded (and I have recorded the grades for) Quiz #3.
The class average was about 23 (or about 93%); the median was 24 (or about
  96%).
Look at your returned work carefully; if your score was below 20 (which is 80%)
  you might want to review this quiz with me or a TA.
Material similar to this will be on the first written exam.
<p>
After I return your graded work in class on Monday, please download the 
  <b>Grades(zipped .xlsm file)</b> from the course web and ensure that I have
  computed and entered your grade correctly (I'll be entering thousands of
  grades for students in my course this quarter, so even if I'm 99% accurate,
  I'm likely to record some incorrect grades.
Note that all grades are recorded as integral values: I always round up
  (e.g., a quiz score of 22.5 is recorded as 23).
<p>
If you believe that the TA has graded any of your work incorrectly, I encourage
  you to see him immediately about the discrepancy (in the case of programming
  assignments, you will alwasy see your TA too).
Such a discussion can have only positive outcomes: either he will agree with you
 that you deserve more credit (and, we do want you to receive all the credit
 that you are due), or you will come to understand the question, program, or
  solution better.
This is certainly a win-win situation.
In any case, carefully examine my solution before you come to see him.
Also, because of the size of this class, if you have a grading issue, you must
  bring it to TAs attention within a week of when I return the materials.
<p>
Generally written exams and quizzes are graded more closely
  than programming assignments.
If the average on any testing instrument is less than 75%, the column for
  that instrument will show the number of normalization points: the number of
  points each student would have needed to earn to have that instrument's
  average be 75%: these number of points are then added to the sum of the
  points for each student (in a later column).
This is the only curving I do in grading.
On this testing instrument (and typically most others, except the written
  exams), the normalization points are 0.
<p>
If you do not pick up your returned work in class, you should pick it up during
  my office hours ASAP; I don't like keeping student quizzes: it makes my office
  messier, and you don't get the benefit of the feedback written on the quiz.
<p>
Generally most students did well on all the problems.
Student who didn't approximate logarithms base 2 (e.g., Log2 1000 ~ 10) and
  instead calculated logarithms (9.96578, so 10 is wrong by .3 percent) had
  points deducted, as per the directions.
You should learn to do "back of the envelope" calculations, and you will not be
  able to use a calculator during the exam.

Some (but not many) students failed to turn in both a Checkmate solution and a
  printed quiz with the answers written on it. For future assignments, you will
  frequently submit your materials both online to Checkmate and on the printed
  quiz (although for Quiz #3 there is NO checkmate submission).

Generally most students did well on all the problems.
There were many small mistakes in problem #1 (including not writing / in
  variables t and b) or not crossing out / (in the LN storing 4) or other
  pointers: I graded this problem.
Problems #2-#4 were tested by running the code and counting failures.
Also, if a problem said to write a recursive solution, then an iterative one
  was unacceptable.
It turns out, based on what I've read, that C++ stores <b>std::string</b> with
  a '\0' terminator and doesn't care whether you access an index outside the
  string (including its length, which is the '\0' terminator).
The result is that many students wrote "slopply" code (which wouldn't work for
  the equivalent problem comparing linked lists) but did work for
  <b>std::string</b>.
On the midterm/final, we are likely to NOT have <b>std::string</b> problems for
  this reason; so if you write the same "sloppy" code you will likely lose more
  points on these instruments.

<p>
Generally most students did well on all the problems; we deducted points
  for overly-complicated code and non-working code.
The loop for problem #4 must be an indefinite loop: a for-each loop iterating
  through the key-value pairs might work for small problems (if it luckily
  iterates in the right order), but in general you need to write code similar
  to that in my solution.

  First Lab
</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
  As part of your first day in lab, students should check that they can log on
    to the ICS lab computers: those students who took previous ICS courses
    (which should be most of you) should have these accounts already.
  If you can log into these accounts, you can use them.
  <p>
  If you cannot log into these accounts, you should visit ICS-364 with your
     student ID during the lab, to have them activate an account for you.
  Activation may take a few days.
  In the meantime, you can work on your own computer or log onto the lab
    computers with the ID <b>ics-temp</b> and the password <b>Anteat3r</b>
   (yes, a capital <b>A</b> and the number <b>3</b>).
  When using Eclipse with this temp account, you must create a workspace on
    your desktop, not the <b>H</b> drive (otherwise all temp users would be
    sharing that workspace).

  #2: 1/6/14<br>
  Install Course Software
</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
  All students with computers should download and install the Course Software:
    Java (to run Eclipse), C++, and Eclipse (along with the <b>courselib</b>
    and <b>googletestlib</b> libraries).
  All three products are available for free on the internet.
  (note that Java is already installed on Macs).
  Students can view instructions for downloading and installing this software
    by following then
    <a href="../common/online.html" target="main">Course Software</a>
    link.
  You may complete the assignments using whatever software you want, but
    Eclipse (using C++ and MinGW) will be the official software.
  I <b>strongly</b> recommend that you become familiar with these systems during
    the first week of the quarter.

  <p>
  Although students can work on their programming assignments on the computers
    in the UCI labs, I expect students with computers to download and install
    this software by the end of the first week of the quarter.
  If you are having difficulty with this task, the TAs and Lab Tutors will help
    you during the first Lab meeting (or beyond, if necessary: bring your
    computer to the lab); if you have successfully downloaded and installed
    this software, please help other students do so too.
  Finally, you can also use the class MessageBoard Forums to ask questions about
    this software and help other students.

  Welcome to ICS-46.
  I am going to post and archive important messages about the class in this
    announcements web page: each entry will be numbered, dated, and labeled.
  The entries will appear in reverse chronological order.
  Whenever you follow the link to this page, scan its top for new announcements;
    scan downward for older announcements.
  This message will always appear at the bottom of this file. 
  <p>
  I will never remove a message from this page, although a subsequent message
    may "cancel" a previous one; in such a case, I'll refer to the number of a 
    canceled message in the message that cancels it.
  <p>
  Expect a few new messages to be posted here each week, mostly regarding graded
     work.
  <p>
  Check this Announcements page, along with the Forums on MessageBoard, daily.
