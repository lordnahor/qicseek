Three neat Web finds:

<LI><A NAME="QQ1"><H2>What is a protocol?</H2></A> 
A <B>protocol</B> is an agreement on how different computers will communicate or 
exchange information.  An example would be <I>HTTP</I> which is commonly used by the 
World Wide Web.  Other kinds of protocols include Ymodem, Xmodem, Kermit, Zmodem, etc.  
Zmodem is the most common one used today because of its special ability to continue 
transmitting a particular file after it has been interrupted (also known as 
"crash-recovery").  Many different kinds of protocols are being introduced in order to 
improve the efficiency and reliability of transmitting files.

<LI><A NAME="QQ2"><H2>What is an HTML?</H2></A>
<B>HTML</B> stand for HyerText Markup Language.  It is a specific SGML_DTD (Standard 
Generalized Markup Language_Document Type Definitions).  It is a specific kind of code 
in order to make documents more readable (and more attractive) to the 
reader.  In fact, this document you are reading was written in HTML.  It 
is the primary markup language used by the World Wide Web. The language of HTML has become more complex as new versions 
come out.  Consumers are demanding new features constantly.  So far, there are three 
levels of HTML.

<LI><A NAME="QQ3"><H2>What is a democracy?</H2></A>
In the world of politics, <B>democracy</B> is a form of government in 
which the citizens of the entity decide over public policies.  It is 
sometimes known as the 'majority rule'.  Most contemporary Western 
countries nowadays are using democracy as a form of government.  In order 
for the citizen to have an influence over public policy matter, they must 
must participate in some way.  The purpose of democracy is for the people 
of the society to have a say over how the government is run. It is the 
opposite of a dictatorship or a totaltarian country.

<LI><A NAME="QQ4"><H2>What is political participation?</H2></A>
<B>Political Participation</B> refers to the actions a citizen of a 
society can take in order to influence the process of the government.  
Political participation is most common with democratic societies.  There 
are many different kinds of political participation.  Voting in elections 
is the most common and direct way of influencing the government.  Other 
forms of political participation include campaigning, protests, 
donations, attending a political meeting, contact locally with others, 
etc.  However, with all these kinds of participation available to the 
citizens, political participation has gone down in some contemporary 
democrarcy countries especially the United States.

<LI><A NAME="QQ5"><H2>What formats are picture files stored in?</H2></A>
There are many ways in which pictures are stored in a file.  The most 
popular ones today are <B>GIFs</B> and <B>JPEGs</B> which are most 
commonly used in networking and bulletin board services.  The important 
concept of a picture format is compression and access time in order to 
display the picture.  Other kinds of picture format include BMP 
(Windows), PCX (PC Paintbrush), WPG (WordPerfect), MSP (Microsoft Paint), 
EPS (PostScript), MAC (MacPaint), etc.  MPEG is the most common format 
used today to display animations of pictures.  Different kinds of format 
will be developed in the future to increase speed and compression.
