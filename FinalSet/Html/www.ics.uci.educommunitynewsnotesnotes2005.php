<p>Bren School of ICS faculty, students and research initiatives are some of the most well regarded successes on the UC Irvine campus. We are pleased to announce the following noteworthy achievements for 2005.</p>
<p>Awards, grants and other honors can be sent to <a href="mailto: ic%73%6ee%77%73@ics.%75ci%2e%65d%75 ">icsnews@ics.uci.edu </a> to be considered for publication. </p>

<strong><a name="suprise"></a>NSF study will probe the quintessence of surprise</strong>
            </p>

<p>
Pierre<br/> Baldi</p>
</div>
Professor of computer science <strong>Pierre Baldi</strong> and information theorist Laurent Itti of the University of Southern California are joining with electro physiologist Douglas Mu&#241;oz of Queens University, Canada on a
           
              
              study of how brains measure &#8220;surprise&#8221; in a data stream.
<p>The computational theory of surprise was developed by Baldi in 1999 and first published in 2002. The NSF award will allow the multi-organizational team to put the theory to test. Early laboratory experiments have shown the Bayesian model of surprise outperforms previous theories in predicting human responses to suddenly unusual stimuli.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe this approach has potential for profoundly changing our current notions of how &#8216;important&#8217; or &#8216;surprising&#8217; information is understood,&#8221; said Baldi, also the Director of the Institute for Genomics and Informatics (IGB) at UCI. </p>
<p>Baldi and Itti will present the outlines of their new mathematical understanding of surprise &#8212; along with their empirical studies on human subjects that support their theory &#8212; on Wednesday, December 7 at the Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) Conference in Vancouver, British Columbia. </p>
<p>The new NSF project combines forces of Baldi&#8217;s computational and theory labs with the modeling and psychophysics lab of USC&#8217;s Laurent Itti, and expands the research to include neurophysiological studies of brain mechanisms in Mu&#241;oz electrophysiology lab at Queen&#8217;s University (Canada). Both experiments and modeling will be combined in the project to develop a new understanding of how the brain codes for novelty and importance.</p>

<strong><a name="lathrop_innovation"></a>Professor to be honored with Innovation Award</strong> 
</p>
<div class="img_caption_left">

<p>
Richard<br/> Lathrop</p>
</div>
Professor of computer science <strong>Richard Lathrop</strong> and professor of microbiology and molecular genetics G. Wesley Hatfield will be recognized for their unique entrepreneurial contributions at a November 9 ceremony honoring UCI&#8217;s most significant innovators. The event is part of celebration activities surrounding UCI&#8217;s 40th anniversary.
<p>Lathrop and Hatfield have seen their joint research in the emerging field of synthetic biology, applying computational and biological methods to optimize the self-assembly of chemically synthesized genes, blossom into UC patents, a fully functioning Computational Biology Research Laboratory (CBRL), a thriving start-up company (CODA Genomics, Irvine, CA), a cascade of new research projects criss-crossing the campus, a flood of new external funding for the university, and a growing list of industry applications.</p>
<p>Novel synthetic genes assembled for UCI researchers by the CBRL include a red fluorescent protein that allows cell biologists to track metabolic events through cellular process in living cells; a gene instrumental in the development of a DNA vaccine; and a synthetic version of a newly discovered protein that causes cancer.</p>

Assistant professor of computer science <strong>Max Welling</strong> along with Pietro Perona at Caltech have received a joint NSF grant to build a computer vision system that learns a taxonomy of visual object categories without supervision.
<p>Learning visual object categories, and recognizing objects in images, is perhaps the most difficult and exciting problem in machine vision today. In light of the fast growing data deluge in science, engineering, industry and society, recognition systems must be able to operate without human supervision. This poses new challenges: How can one learn automatically models of a large number of object classes from unlabelled images? How can one represent these object classes such that they can be searched efficiently? How can one leverage the learnt models to learn new object classes from very few examples?</p>
<p>Welling and Perona plan to combat these challenges by inferring hierarchical representations of object classes from unlabelled image data. Object classes are represented as constellations of parts, where each part extracts shape and appearance information. Non-parametric Bayesian techniques may be employed to organize these object classes into tree-structured representations. The richness of this representation grows incrementally as more data is presented to the system. New similarity measures between object classes naturally derive from this representation facilitating recognition.</p>

Professor of computer science <strong>Padhraic Smyth</strong> along with professor of earth systems science Gudrun Magnusdottir and professor of statistics <strong>Hal Stern</strong> have been awarded a 3-year $618,000 National Science Foundation grant to develop statistical image analysis and tracking algorithms for analyzing satellite images of large-scale atmospheric disturbances over time.
<p>The project will focus specifically on developing tools to better understand a phenomenon known as the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), an important part of global large-scale atmospheric circulation. New models and algorithms will be investigated for tracking dynamic objects in images over time, using historical image data from visible and infra-red imagery, as well as satellite estimates of winds and liquid cloud water content.</p>
<p>Research on this project will be carried out by a collaborative effort between the Bren School of ICS and the Department of Earth System Sciences at UC Irvine, including faculty members Smyth and Stern in ICS and Magnusdottir (in Earth System Sciences), Ph.D. student Lucas Scharenbroich and postdoctoral fellow Alex Ihler in the Computer Science department, and postoctoral fellow Chai-chi Wang in the ESS department. </p>

<strong><a name="humbolt_award"></a>Professor earns Humboldt Research Award </strong>
<p>
<strong>Alfred Kobsa</strong>, professor of informatics, has been awarded the coveted Alexander von Humboldt Research Award, conferred by the government of Germany upon senior foreign scientists and scholars. He will be accepting the award next Spring in Germany.             
			</p>
<p>The research award honours the academic achievements of the award winner&#8217;s lifetime. Furthermore, award winners are invited to carry out research projects of their own choice in Germany in cooperation with colleagues in Germany.             
			</p>
<p>Kobsa will work with Professor Oliver G&#252;nther and Dr. Sarah Spiekermann from Humboldt University, Berlin, and jointly study privacy implications of the usage of radio frequency identification tags in the retail industry.
            </p>
<p>The award program was inaugurated in thankful response for the European Recovery Program, or Marshall Plan established by the United States government after World War II. </p>
<p>The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation was entrusted with implementation of the program, which initially recognized senior natural scientists from the U.S., but which has since been extended to internationally recognized scholars in the field of humanities, including lawyers, social scientists, and economists, throughout the world.</p>
<p>However, the emphasis of the program continues to be in the honoring of American natural scientists. The object is to pay tribute to academic accomplishments of award winners and to foster long-term cooperation between foreign and German researchers.</p>

<a name="dechter_radcliffe"></a><strong>Dechter awarded Radcliffe fellowship</strong>
<p>
  <strong>Rina Dechter</strong>, professor of computer science, has been awarded a fellowship from the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University to pursue her research in automated reasoning.
</p>
<p>Dechter will spend the 2005-2006 academic year at the Radcliffe Institute to pursue her project on advanced search strategies for mixed probabilistic and deterministic networks.</p>
<p>Dechter's research has focused on automated reasoning, i.e., writing computer programs that assist in solving problems and answering questions by drawing conclusions from knowledge (e.g., data and facts). Automated reasoning research has evolved around two distinct ways of representing knowledge. </p>
<p>One way of representing knowledge uses hard constraints. An example of a hard constraint might be "a student cannot enroll in two courses if they meet at the same time." </p>
<p>The other recognizes that knowledge involves uncertainty and therefore uses probabilistic statements such as "if a student has a solid math background, he or she is likely (but not certain) to do well in computer classes." </p>
<p>Many real-life applications involve both types of information. The goal of Dechter's research project during her fellowship year is to work on a framework for automated reasoning that would accommodate both hard constraints and probabilistic information. </p>
<p>Reasoning about such "mixed" knowledge bases often requires lengthy and complex computation. Dechter will therefore focus on the development of efficient computational techniques that will enhance the usefulness of such automated reasoning systems.</p>
<p>Radcliffe Institute fellowships are designed to support scholars, scientists, artists, and writers of exceptional promise and demonstrated accomplishments who wish to pursue work in academic and professional fields and in the creative arts.<br/>
