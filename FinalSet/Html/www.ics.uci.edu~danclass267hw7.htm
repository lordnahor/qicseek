Do only TWO of the following.

<OL>
<LI>
     Given a discrete distribution on <I>n</I> points and a desired
     number of quantization levels <I>M</I>,
     find the optimum quantization points in time
     <I>O</I>(<I>nM</I>&nbsp;log&nbsp;<I>n</I>)
     [or at least faster than
     <I>O</I>(<I>n</I><sup>3</sup>&nbsp;log&nbsp;<I>M</I>)]
     using dynamic programming.
<BR> Hint: A perhaps useful reference is
     <BR>P. Brucker, ``On the complexity of clustering,''
     in <I>Optimization and Operations Research</I>
     (R. Henn, B. Korte, W. Oletti, eds.),
     Springer Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg, New York (1977), pp. 45-54.
<P>
<LI> What is "dithering" and why is it relevant for scalar quantization?
<P>
<LI> Consider a 2-state trellis which operates at a rate of one bit
     per sample, used for encoding uniformly distributed samples
     in the interval [0,1].  Each stage of this trellis has the
     following four edges (<I>A, B</I>) = (<I>value, code</I>)
     to the next stage, where <I>A</I> and <I>B</I> are states
     in the current and next stages,
     <I>value</I> is a quantized value, and <I>code</I>
     is the bit emitted to indicate the branch taken:
    <UL>
     <LI> (0,0) = (<I>x</I>, 0)
     <LI> (0,1) = (<I>x</I>+0.5, 1)
     <LI> (1,0) = (0.5<I>-x</I>, 0)
     <LI> (1,1) = (1<I>-x</I>, 1)
    </UL>
     and <I>x</I> is given to be in the range [0, 0.25].
  <P>
     Now consider an <I>n</I>-stage trellis code obtained by
     replicating the above stage.
  <P>
    <OL type=a>
     <LI> Let <I>x</I> = 0.1 and <I>n</I> = 10.
          Write a simulator that generates a sufficient number of
          <I>n</I>-vectors of random samples from [0,1],
          determines the optimum trellis code for each,
          and calculates the average SQNR in decibels.
     <LI> Vary <I>x</I> and determine the optimum value of <I>x</I>
          so as to maximize the average SQNR.
     <LI> Vary <I>n</I> to determine approximately the asymptotic
          optimal value of <I>x</I> and the corresponding average SQNR
          for an arbitrarily large trellis.
     <LI> Determine the optimum <I>x</I> and the corresponding
          average SQNR when using an on-line (as opposed to a Viterbi)
          branch selection and compare the results.
