             <p>These materials were assembled 
             by the following participants in the workshop: Kristen 
             Arbutiski, Julie Ballin, Matt Bietz, Jeremy Birnholtz,

     <p class="subhead">Measures of collaboratory 
             success </p>
     <p>All of the discussion groups, to varying degrees, began 
             consideration of collaboratory success by first attempting 
             to define a collaboratory.
       Synthesizing across these efforts produces 
             the following description:
       </p>
             <BLOCKQUOTE>A collaboratory 
             is a network-based facility and organizational entity 
             that spans distance, supports rich and recurring human 
             interaction oriented to a common research area, fosters 
             contact between researchers who are both known and 
             unknown to each other, and provides access to data 
             sources, artifacts and tools required to accomplish 
             research tasks.</BLOCKQUOTE>
     <p>Several features of this definition are helpful in thinking 
             about how to measure collaboratory success.
       First, the emphasis on spanning distance suggests 
             that when measuring collaboratory success, the correct 
             comparison is with other forms of long-distance collaboration 
             &#8211; and not with collocated collaboration.
       Second, the emphasis on contacts, recurring 
             interaction, and artifacts suggests that a critical 
             contribution of a collaboratory is to be a social 
             arena for research work &#8211; but an arena that 
             is not tied to a particular physical space.
       And finally, the emphasis on research suggests 
             that the impact of collaboratories must be evaluated 
             in terms of products critical to the research endeavor, 
             such as creation of new knowledge and techniques.
       </p>
     <p>The 
             following examples illustrate different kinds of measures 
             that may reflect success in collaboratory-based collaboration, 
             both in terms of process and product, when compared 
             to more traditional long-distance collaboration: frequency 
             and impact of discoveries; frequency and impact of 
             publications; diversity among collaborators (on multiple 
             dimensions); satisfaction of collaborators; frequency 
             of travel; number and prestige of honors accumulated 
             by collaborators; proportion of collaborations composed 
             of first-time collaborators; impact of the collaborations 
             on the training of young scientists; attracting newcomers 
             to the field, frequency and duration of delays; level 
             of interpersonal trust; extent of shared mental models; 
             degree of mutually consistent work practices; and 
             level of public interest.
       </p>
     <p>These 
             proposed measures form the focus for three principal 
             research threads: a) exploration of the feasibility 
             and sensitivity of the success measures using retrospective 
             and prospective data from operational collaboratories 
             &#8211; in comparison with traditional long-distance 
             collaborations; b) exploration of the different collaboratory 
             types that have evolved (e.g., integrated versus aggregation 
             of separate applications) &#8211; and how these types 
             influence success; and c) exploration of how collaboratory 
             stakeholders, level of analysis, and time interact 
             to influence success.
       An overarching concern was the problem of finding 
             a sufficient number of viable collaboratories to form 
             a sample for examining the impact of collaboratories.

     <p class="subhead">Group processes in collaboratories</p>
         <p>A way to view group processes in collaboratories is 
             to see these as independent variables that influence 
             the success measures summarized in the preceding section. This section, then, is divided into two parts. First, a list of candidate processes are 
             proposed.Then, 
             these candidate processes are analyzed in terms of 
             their importance to understanding collaboratory success.
       </p>
     <p><u>Candidate 
             processes</u></p>
     <p>The processes suggested in the discussion groups included: 
             a) awareness, meaning the availability and interpretation 
             of cues about what others are doing; b) task interdependence, 
             such as Van de Ven et al.'s (1976) scheme of pooled, 
             sequential, reciprocal, and team tasks; c) maintenance 
             of common ground; d) group dynamics (including trust, 
             leadership, conflict resolution, decision making, 
             roles, and goal setting); e) creation of routines 
             and procedures; f) communication, such as cultural 
             sensitivity and fluency; and g) interaction of task 
             and process characteristics and technology (e.g., 
             scarcity of instrument time).
</p>
     <p><u>Important 
             processes</u></p>
     <p>To 
             guide examination of the processes listed above, workshop 
             participants discussed building on an effort launched 
             by the Science of Collaboratories group at Michigan 
             to produce a framework for identifying variables of 
             interest.
This framework can be developed both retrospectively based 
             on data previously collected and prospectively for 
             new and ongoing collaboratories.
       Examples of relevant contexts include face-to-face 
             collaboration within and across science and engineering 
             labs and distributed collaboration outside of a collaboratory. 
       </p>
     <p>An 
             additional suggested starting point was to consider 
             how the identified processes and variables might moderate 
             and mediate collaboratory success.
       That is, from Baron and Kenny's (1986) description, 
             a moderator variable influences the strength or direction 
             of the relationship between an independent and a dependent 
             variable and a mediator variable explains the mechanism 
             behind the relationship.
       In the case of collaboratories, for example, 
             there may be an interest in how a particular measure 
             of collaboratory use relates to a particular measure 
             of collaboratory success &#8211; where this relationship 
             may be moderated by some factors (e.g., task interdependence) 
             and mediated by others (e.g., awareness).

     <p class="subhead">Organizational and community 
           consequences of collaboratory use</p>
<p>The 
             discussions of organizational and community consequences 
             of collaboratory use were focused along two lines: 
             examination of potential consequences, assuming widespread 
             collaboratory use; and specific collaboratory-based 
             interventions that might have beneficial outcomes 
             (e.g., expanding the pipeline for training of future 
             scientists).
</p>
     <p><u>Potential 
             consequences</u></p>
     <p><i>Expanded 
             access</i> &#8211; While some workshop participants noted that claims 
             for expanded access to science, through collaboratory 
             use, are probably exaggerated &#8211; there was still 
             hope that collaboratory development might create new 
             opportunities for broader participation in research 
             (particularly among institutions with fewer resources, 
             both domestically and internationally).
       Specifically, collaboratories may provide a 
             way for faculty at Master's Colleges and Universities 
             I and II (i.e., from the Carnegie Classification &#8211; 
             institutions that are primarily oriented to undergraduates 
             and award 20 to 40 masters degrees per year) to maintain 
             active research involvement with colleagues at Doctoral/Research 
             Universities &#8211; Extensive (i.e., from the Carnegie 
             Classification &#8211; institutions with undergraduate 
             and graduate programs, typically awarding 50 or more 
             doctorates per year across 15 or more disciplines).
       Also, collaboratories may provide a compelling 
             mechanism for outreach, particularly to K-12 audiences 
             (i.e., via science museums, classroom use and etc.).
</p>
     <p><i>Structural 
             transformation</i> &#8211; Again, while some participants expressed skepticism 
             &#8211; many expected that widespread collaboratory 
             use would produce changes in the structure of scientific 
             communities.
Specifically, collaboratories were seen 
             as accelerating trends toward increased multi-disciplinarity 
             (although there were concerns about the scientific 
             value of multi-disciplinarity) and toward cross-institutional 
             mentoring.Similarly, 
             there was an expectation that feedback might occur, 
             such that wider adoption of previously unorthodox 
             practices (e.g., electronic publication) and career 
             tracks (e.g., outside the tenure system) may also 
             produce incentives that reward collaboratory use &#8211; 
             which in turn, may accelerate transformation of the 
             status quo (e.g., by increasing visibility of junior 
             scientists or of researchers outside the scientific 
             mainstream).
</p>
     <p><i>New 
             kinds of science</i> &#8211; A principal envisioned impact was the capability 
             to bring previously unrelated communities of researchers 
             together through the capacity of collaboratories to 
             combine data in new ways.
For example, in the Space Physics and 
             Aeronomy Collaboratory, observational and simulation 
             data can be viewed side by side, which has led to 
             new interactions between theoretical space physicists 
             and experimental space physicists.</p>
     <p><i>Increased 
             production</i> &#8211; In the discussion of success measures, increased 
             rates of publication and discovery were identified 
             as important outcomes of collaboratory use.
       Discussions focused on the sensitivity of such 
             measures with particular attention to the lag between 
             adoption of innovative practices and impact in terms 
             of publication or citation patterns.
Comparisons to earlier innovations, like email and electronic 
             journals, suggested that even at mature points in 
             the penetration of these innovations &#8211; it was 
             still hard to see impact in terms of citation data.
       However, broader access to the Internet does 
             seem to have played a role in the dramatic increase 
             of papers within one very special class (authors from 
             ten or more different countries).
       Collaboratory impact might be most visible 
             in the case of similar &#8220;mega-collaborations.&#8221;
One proposal was to track the number of 
             different congressional districts represented among 
             authors on papers from collaboratory-based collaborations 
             versus conventional long-distance collaborations.
       </p>
     <p class="subhead">Collaboratory-based interventions</p>
<p>In 
             terms of next steps for research there was a reluctance 
             to pursue the connection between collaboratory use 
             and broad changes &#8211; both because of the immaturity 
             of collaboratory technology and because of the multi-causal 
             nature of large transformations (e.g., the trend toward 
             multi-institution authorship has been increasing for 
             several decades &#8211; pre-dating the Internet, collaboratories 
             and other more recent inventions).
       However, there was enthusiasm for tightly scoped 
             interventions with high impact, both in terms of outcomes 
             and as demonstrations.
       For example, in terms of Ph.D. production in 
             the United States, a small set of selective liberal 
             arts colleges have performed at a disproportionately 
             high level (Carrier &amp; Davis-Van Atta, 1987) &#8211; 
             with corresponding disproportionate representation 
             among authors of highly-cited publications and among 
             members of the National Academy of Sciences.
The keys to this success are partially related to the admission 
             criteria of these institutions &#8211; but other important 
             factors include exposure to hands on research activity 
             and mentorship by faculty.
With the right mixture of support, collaboratories 
             might be used to produce the conditions currently 
             found only at these selective liberal arts colleges, 
             but across a wider array of institutions &#8211; with 
             corresponding increases in the number of students 
             choosing to pursue graduate degrees and research careers.
