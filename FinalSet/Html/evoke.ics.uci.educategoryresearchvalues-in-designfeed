				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This project will enliven everyday life on campus. As with many campuses, the design of public space at UCI has been motivated by values of efficiency (getting cars parked, getting students to classes) and security (keeping it safe) and are seen by many as “sociofugal” &#8211;unfriendly and uninspiring &#8212; spaces.  Our challenge is to take such a ‘dead’ space (a parking garage, unused open space) on campus and develop a redesign based around the values of hesitation and presence.  By hesitation and presence, we mean creating spaces where people will stop, become aware of the area and people around themselves, and engage in meditation or reflection in ways that take them outside of the constant drive to get to the next class or meeting &#8212; thereby both permitting and encouraging enriched relationships with their physical environments. To get there, we will use ideas and principles from the fields of design, architecture, social ecology and computer science.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mornings were devoted to discussing a judicious mix of readings and exercises. In the afternoons, students worked in interdisciplinary teams working on projects to incorporate strong social values into information systems and technology, with guest lectures from thought leaders such as Paul Dourish, Helen Nissenbaum, and Carl DiSalvo throughout the week. The workshop closed with project presentations to a panel of academics and entrepreneurs. Below are descriptions of each of the 2012 projects:</p>
<p><img src="http://evoke.ics.uci.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/realtalk.gif" alt="realtalk" width="180" height="180" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-540" /></p>
<h4>Stickets</h4>
<p>Real Talk is a multi-media toolkit for community engagement, transparency, and mobile governance.  The toolkit revolves around Stickets&#8211;vibrantly colored bio-degradable stickers&#8211;that a community can use to draw attention to any part of their physical environment.  A community-wide &#8220;Sticket Day&#8221; centered around neighborhood safety, for example, would visually highlight problem areas in a neighborhood, which with the help and guidance of the toolkit would allow local Real Talk &#8220;ambassadors&#8221; to document and geo-locate these places online using their phones.  Information that was held by the community thereby becomes simultaneously visible online and in the world, which enhances opportunities for engagement with local government and community stakeholders.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>Stickets&#8217; design challenge: Transparency and Mobile Governance</i></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Transparency in government is linked to better engagement, feelings of empowerment, and participation in local government by the community. According to a recent pew survey, low-income teenagers are more likely to access the internet through a smartphone than through a computer; adoption of smartphones among low-income (&gt;$30,000) Americans between the ages of 18-35 is roughly consistent with the national average. However, these same groups may be among the most underserved in terms of local government access and participation, particularly in the area of laws and services created to protect their rights. Your challenge is to design a mobile application or device to increase transparency of or access to government services to underserved individuals or communities.</p>

<h4>Boy 2.0</h4>
<p>What if we could harness the best parts of boys’ play while rechanneling impulses of aggression and hyper-competition? What if we, as a culture, nurtured boys to play differently? What if we asked that toys for boys guide social development the way we have begun to expect from toys designed for girls? Boy 2.0 is line of toys designed to appeal to boys that encourage empathy, collaboration and conflict-netralization. One example is WeeSplat&#8211;a reinterpretation of the toy gun in the form of a snake that coils around the boy&#8217;s arm with a sticky, tentacle-esque tongue that can be fired out to capture game tokens. Playing collaboratively with a friend enables new features like lights and sounds that aren&#8217;t available when playing solo. By capitalizing on the kinds of play in which boys are already engaging, BOY 2.0 is a product line that will facilitate social change and be a satisfying product.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>Boy 2.0&#8242;s design challenge: Dark Values and Design for Hesitation</i></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">When we design with values in mind, there is a natural tendency to engage the pro-social or aspirational values on the positive end of a spectrum. There are entirely different sets of values – the negative, anti-social, destructive, abusive, abandoning, neglecting, disenfranchising – that are often invoked in cautionary or failure narratives of designed technologies and systems. But, can we design for these dark values with intention, even if only to learn and recognize the processes by which they come into the world? How would you go about designing a technology that embodies the values of control, subtle shifts to rob users of their agency, or subverts human and social values to convince people to behave against their own interests? Moving back toward the theme of responsive and responsible design, how can we design technologies to incorporate moments for hesitation, and opportunities to cultivate a sociotechnical reflexive practice? Each act of design involves acts of inclusion and exclusion. How do we make those explicit in the process of design? Your challenge is to design a piece of technology or software that embodies “Dark Values” or creates a space for hesitation in practice or process.</p>

<p><img src="http://evoke.ics.uci.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/socialcapital.gif" alt="socialcapital" width="180" height="180" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-564" /></p>
<h4>Social Capital</h4>
<p>Social Capital analyzes your relationships and helps you become the person you don’t have time to be. Your social media and digital communication are algorithmically analyzed and packaged for you to quickly and efficiently catch up on all the important events in the lives of your friends, family and acquaintances. The mobile app presents information using easy to digest visualizations, allowing for drill down into specific content and trends of communication patterns over time. Never be caught unaware again.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>Social Capital&#8217;s design challenge: Dark Values and Design for Hesitation</i></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">When we design with values in mind, there is a natural tendency to engage the pro-social or aspirational values on the positive end of a spectrum. There are entirely different sets of values – the negative, anti-social, destructive, abusive, abandoning, neglecting, disenfranchising – that are often invoked in cautionary or failure narratives of designed technologies and systems.

<p><img src="http://evoke.ics.uci.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/string.gif" alt="string" width="180" height="180" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-543" /></p>
<h4>STRING</h4>
<p>The idea behind STRING is simple: it&#8217;s an interface for emotional connection across physical distance. Designed for couples, the device is a loop of string about a meter long, allowing the user to bend it, knot it, twist it, loop it, or wear it. Upon contact with skin, a circuit is completed and sensors capture motion, translating it as an abstract visualization to the other person via a screen-based interface. STRING allows the different physical spaces two people are in to intersect in a discreet, interpretive, and beautiful way.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>STRING&#8217;s design challenge: The Virtual and the Real</i></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The advent of 3D printing technologies and object/motion capture brings new potential for crossing the divide between manifesting thoughts in the digital realm and the physical world. However, these technologies seem to simply bring design across the threshold from the virtual to the real, or from the real to the virtual. How might 3D printing and motion capture be made more complementary to each other? How might virtual representations and the digital capture of physical objects or relationships be made to translate or transduce useful aspects of materiality and embodiment? What new opportunities are there for immersion, reflection, augmentation, and experience in these technologies? What new kinds of aesthetics and evocations are possible when we think across these boundaries? What are the consequences of using the virtual to model the physical, and the physical to model the virtual? Your challenge is to work with modeling software, 3D printing, and motion/image capture devices to challenge the dichotomy of the virtual and the physical, to express its consequences, or to create a new space for experience, reflection, and action in the world.</p>

<p><img src="http://evoke.ics.uci.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/ampdamp.gif" alt="ampdamp" width="180" height="180" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-544" /></p>
<h4>ampDamp</h4>
<p>AmpDamp is a knob that lets you control the volume of social media updates. Designed specifically to work with Twitter, it provides an analog interface for controlling the volume of specific voices in your digital information stream. Users can identify accounts in their Twitter feed that are too noisy, and use the knob to &#8220;turn down the volume,&#8221; causing these voices to fade from the screen. When the user is ready for more noise, the knob can be cranked back up. AmpDamp helps keep important messages from getting lost in the crowd.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>ampDamp&#8217;s design challenge: Polyphony and Emerging Configurations of Knowledge</i></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Herotodus and Rabelais have been held up as writers of ‘polyphonous’ works – texts that incorporate multiple voices without the voice of the author making judgments between them. Polyphony seems to be a natural outcome of web-based writing, with the widespread practices and possibilities around commenting on, revising, and otherwise marking up text presented online. Even articles in the form of a traditional single-author voice become polyphonous when they are linked and spread among communities that have the opportunity to comment on or contribute to the work. However, conventions of presentation and fragmentation lead these multiple voices to cacophony rather than a rich multiplicity. Your challenge is to design an object or piece of software that leverages the possibilities of large and various numbers of voices and contributors in a graceful, rich polyphony.</p>

<p><img src="http://evoke.ics.uci.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/parresia.gif" alt="parresia" width="180" height="180" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-545" /></p>
<h4>Parresia</h4>
<p>Parresia is a system designed to bring attention back to the things that matter to you. Deceptively simple, it consists of a ritualized practice of creating a small paper ball using origami folding techniques that represents a (usually unquantifiable) goal&#8211;be more patient, get more sleep, go to more baseball games&#8211;the things that never seem to make it onto your overcrowded to-do lists of papers to write, emails to return, or meetings to attend. The purpose of Parresia is to create a physical object and place where the goals we don&#8217;t write down are recognized and reflected upon.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>Parresia&#8217;s design challenge: The Qualified Self</i></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The ‘quantified self’ is generically a movement wherein individuals make themselves, their biology and genetics, the subject and object of algorithmic living and substantial numerical representation. However, these quantifications generally focus on the measurable, tangible quantities of a person while ignoring the intangibles that directly contribute both to health and quality of life. You challenge is to design a system for the ‘qualified self’ that includes a procedure for the measurement and encouragement of contentment, pleasure, peace, and affirmation and similar intangibles.</p>
