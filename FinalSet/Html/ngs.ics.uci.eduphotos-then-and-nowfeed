		<description><![CDATA[Re: We got to change our perspective and think of all the billions of photos that are being captured by billions of people world-wide using their phones.

I don&#039;t disagree but the value of a photo is much lower to a 14 year old today than to one 15 or 50 years ago.   The value of the photo is directly proportional to the cost of the photo-capture device (low), complexity of taking a photo (low), availability of photo (instantly high) and shareability (high).]]></description>
