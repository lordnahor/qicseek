<h3>Instructions for Assignment 7: Project Progress Reports</h3>
The instructions for this assignment are quite simple. You need to (a)
write a brief report (up to 3 pages) that summarizes your
progress so far,
(b) write a MATLAB script that demonstrates your progress so far.&nbsp;<br>
<h4>
(a) Project Progress Report</h4>
Your project progress report should contain the following sections:
<br>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Section 1</strong>: The overall goals of the project (a paragraph, or a
bulleted list)</li>
  <li><strong>Section 2</strong>: The intermediate goals you have achieved so far, e.g.,
(a) setting up your data sets, design, (b) implementation, and testing
of feature extraction
code, (c) running classification/detection experiments, and so on. You should
have about 2 to 5 intermediate goals.&nbsp; For each of the
intermediate goals write a short subsection (2.1, 2.2, etc) that
includes:
<ul>
  <li> a brief definition of what you have actually done with respect to this
    goal,e.g., what you have implemented in code for this goal, described
    by using some text with a high-level pseudocode or flowchart
    description.&nbsp; You can refer to specific names of your ".m"
    functions that you include in your submitted code in Part (b). Be sure
    to indicate which functions you have written and which you obtained from
    elsewhere.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
  </li>
  <ul><li>
      preliminary results if available (e.g., some images with examples of
      features
      found, or preliminary classification results). If there are no
      preliminary results you can demonstrate, explain why. Please use
      example images to illustrate progress if you can.<br>
    </li>
    <li> the status in terms of completion of this goal (e.g., "this code has
      been written
      but not fully debugged or tested yet").</li>
    <li>a list of any difficulties that you have encountered so far or
      anticipate encountering</li>
  </ul>
  <li>&nbsp;<strong>Section 3</strong>: A brief section (a few lines or bulleted list) describing
what remains
to be done on the project (coding, testing, documentation, extended
task, etc) and any difficulties
that you anticipate in getting the project finished.</li>
</ul>
<h4>
(b) Project Demo Script</h4>
Write a simple demo script called <b>progress.m</b> that illustrates
in
some simple manner the progress you have made so far, e.g.,
<p>data = load sampleimages
<br>
templates = load templates
<br>
[features labels] = feature_extract(data, templates);
<br>
plot_features(features,labels,feature1, feature2);&nbsp; % function
to plot the feature values for feature 1 and feature 2 (x-y plot,
colored
according to the labels)
<br>
OR
<br>
display_features(data.images, features)&nbsp; % function that shows
the original images and also visually displays (somehow) the extracted
features for each image
</p>
<p>This is just a simple example. There are lots of different
possibilities
for a sample script, so feel free to be creative! The main thing is
that
you illustrate some aspect of the work you have done so far and that
the
plots/displays provide an indication of progress.
</p>
<p>The scipt should not take any longer than 1 minute to run. (so if it
involves a learning algorithm you may want to include your learning
algorithm code in what you hand in, but run it beforehand, save the
results, and just run the learned classifier in your demo script). The
script
need not illustrate all the work you have done so far, but it should
illustrate at least
one of the goals that you wrote about in the progress report, e.g., the
extraction and visual display of some feature of interest.</p>
<p>Your  script should print comments to the screen to explain what your script is doing and
  it should put titles, labels, etc., on any plots produced. <br>
</p>
<p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE</b>: please make sure that this script runs in a
stand-alone mode and that it includes all functions needed (that are
not part of the standard MATLAB package), and all data needed, in a
single directory. So you need (for example) to include any "support"
functions you have written and any functions that you are using that
were written by someone else (e.g., functions that I provided from
earlier assignments). Be sure to indicate at the top of each function
whether you wrote it or not. <br>
</p>

<h3>What to Turn In</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Your project progress report&nbsp; in WORD or PDF format, called progress.doc or progress.pdf, uploaded to EEE Progress Report directory. <br>
    <br>
</li>
  <li>Upload a Zip file with all the code and data needed to run your script to the EEE&nbsp; Progress Report directory. The Zip file should contain a single
directory with your MATLAB demo script, called progress.m, as well as
all image and data
files, and other MATLAB functions, that are needed to run it. Please do
not upload a Zip file that is greater than 10 Mbytes in size (your
whole submitted directory should not exceed 10 Mbytes, including data,
functions, etc, after compression into a Zip file), e.g., just use a
few images for illustration, rather than uploading the full set. </li>
</ul>
