I am new to researching my family, and by accident I came across your family tree.  I have a 
Pesel Sauerhaft who married a David (?).  They had several children, one of whom Rachel (?) 
married a Shmiel Langsam during the war.  They both died in 1942.
 
Do I have the right family tree.  If not, please point me in the direction where I may continue 
my search.
 
Thanking you in advance.
 
Howard Nightingale

Hi,
Thanks for your inquiry. I am researching ALL Langsam's in the belief it is one large family. 
The core seems to be primarily in Galicia and Slovakia. There were many Samuel (anglocized 
version of Shmiel) Langsam's in our family. Can you elaborate at all? Wife's surname (David's)?  
Where they lived? Shmiel's parents? Age? What is your source for Shmiel Langsam? Do you know of 
other Langsam's from his family?

Please stay in touch.

Good Luck!
-Moishe

Thank you for your answer.    The information I have on the family is as
follows:


Ephroim and Rifka Sauerhaft had four children:  
Fayge Leah (who married Aaron Adler) 
Pesel who married (David?) 
Golda ( who married Lazar Wiesenfeld) and 
Yaakov Baruch (who married Sheinder Rikel)   

Pesel and David
had  five children: Moishe, Itzik, Rifka, Reisel and Rachel (who married
Shmiel Langsam)  

Ephroim and Rifka lived in Bialoboki, Poland.  Pesel was born in Bialoboki, 
Poland and then married David (?) and moved to Drobitzka (it may be Debica).
David (?) was a farmer.


I hope that this helps.


Looking forward to your reply - maybe we are related.


Howard

Hi,
Do you have dates (or years) of birth for Rachel and Shmiel? Have you found anybody with more 
knowledge of this Shmiel?
