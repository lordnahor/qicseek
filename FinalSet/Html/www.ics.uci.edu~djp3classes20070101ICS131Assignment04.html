  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is an individual assignment which is designed to help you prepare for the final exam.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Create a 10-question multiple choice test with answer key. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>One question should  come from  the material covered in each of the 10 weeks. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The questions should seek to evaluate the test takers understanding of the concepts in the course rather than simply asking  questions that could be answered by memorizing a list.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is a bad question:</p>
  <p>Which of the following is one of the 8 golden rules of interface design: A)...B)...C)...D)....</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is a good question:</p>
  <p>If  a user feels like their computer is acting in response to something which they aren't doing and that they don't have control of it, then the have lost: A)Their internal locus of control B)Feedback C) Closure D) Consistency. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You will be graded on the quality of the questions and the correctness of the answer key.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Turn in a paper copy of your test on the last day of class in lecture. </p>
