Transportation Information</FONT></FONT></B></CENTER>

<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">The closest airport for Interface '01 is Orange
County Airport (sometimes referred to as Santa Ana Airport, or John Wayne
Airport), which is within 5 minutes drive from the <A HREF="http://www.costamesa-ca.com/hotel/westin.html">Westin
South Coast Plaza Hotel.</A> Orange County airport is served by Alaska,
America West, American, Continental, Delta, Northwest, Reno Air, Southwest,
TWA, United, and US Air, and has direct flights to most parts of the United
States. In the Baggage Claim area there is a courtesy telephone to the
Westin Hotel, which can be used to arrange for the courtesy van that leaves
every half-hour (on the half-hour and on the hour). Taxis are also plentiful.
Rental cars are available from the Baggage Claim Area.</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT></B>
<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) offers
international connections as well as more non-stop scheduled flights to
US locations. It is located further away from the conference hotel, about
a 45-minute to 1-hour drive (depending on traffic).&nbsp; On the island
outside the Baggage Claim Area, both shuttle vans (about $25 or $30) and
taxis (about $65) are available. Rental cars are also available adjacent
to the Baggage Claim Area.</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT></B>
<P>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial">For attendees who wish to do some sight-seeing
in the Southern California area while visiting, a rental car is probably
a good idea since although there is quite a reasonable public-transportation
system in the area, most attractions, restaurants, etc., require a car
to get there. For attendees who are just planning to attend the conference,
a car is not necessary since there are plenty of restaurants within walking
distance of the hotel.</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT></B>
