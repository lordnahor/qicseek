		<description><![CDATA[according to there rules a submission should consist of a two-page summary to the ACM MM Grand Challenge track and the authors may include a link to an online demo or video. And at the conference, you will introduce the idea shortly to the audience, give a quick demo, and take short questions from the judges. Based on your presentation, a team of judges and the attending crowd will select the top contributors. Now its  your presentation or your idea :s]]></description>

In any case, details will be posted on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://multimediagrandchallenge.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;GC blog&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What problems do Google, Yahoo, HP, Radvision, CeWe, Nokia and other companies see in the future of multimedia? The Multimedia Grand Challenge is a set of problems and issues from these (and other) industry leaders, geared to engage the Multimedia research community in solving relevant, interesting and challenging questions about the industryâ€™s 2-5 year horizon for multimedia. The Grand Challenge is initially presented as part of ACM Multimedia 2009. Researchers will be encouraged to submit working systems in response to the challenge to win the Grand Challenge competition!
