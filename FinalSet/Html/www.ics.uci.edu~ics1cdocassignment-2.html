<H1>UCI ICS 1C, Lab Exercise #2</H1>
<B>Week 3, 24-30 January 1995</B>

<P>During scheduled lab hours from Tuesday, 24 January, to 10:45a.m., Monday,
30 January each person enrolled in ICS 1C should have a member of the ICS
1C instructional staff verify that person's mastery of all the skills given
in the 16 Jan 1995 e-mail describing "ICS 1C, 17-20 Jan Lab Exercises" plus
the following tasks described below.  This assessment will be done by 
randomly checking mastery of some subset of the skills and tasks and will
be confirmed by the person being checked sending e-mail with the subject
"X OKed this" to ics1c@ics.uci.edu, where "X" is the name of the person
doing the checking.  The body of the e-mail message should be the
ics.1c/hot.w3.html file described below in the last supplementary task.

<P>Here are the supplementary tasks:
  <OL>
    <LI>Create a hotlist with at least 10 reasonably named entries.<BR>
      This list should include at least the following URL:
	 <UL>
	 <LI><A HREF="http://www.oac.uci.edu/">
		http://www.oac.uci.edu/</A>
	 <LI><A HREF="http://ea.oac.uci.edu/">
		http://ea.oac.uci.edu/</A>
	 <LI><A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/">
		http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/</A>
	 </UL>
      and your own ics.1c directory which you can access by using the
      "Open Local ..." option under the "File" menu at the top left
      of Mosaic's Document View Window.
    <LI>Use the "Save as ..." option under the "File" menu in Mosaic
      to save in your "ics.1c" both the "Plain Text" and HTML version
      of any (short) HTML file you find of interest.<BR>
<PRE>
 <B>BEWARE:</B> You may have to make the "Save Document" window a bit
   wider in order to have the button at the right end of the 
   "Format for saved document:" line appear so that you can
   click on it with the left mouse button to see the choices
   of format for saving the file.<BR>
</PRE>
      The name of the HTML version of the what you save should end
      in ".html" as in "sample.html"
      Use pico (or another text editor) to examine both the "Plain Text" 
      and HTML versions of the file you have saved and then use the
      "Open Local ..." Option on Mosaic's File menu to examine both.
   <LI>Using the "Mail To" button on the "Hotlist View" window
      (select "Hotlist" from the "Navigate" Menu), mail a copy of your
      hotlist to yourself.  Next, put a copy of this mail to your "ics.1c"
      directory under the name "hot.w3.html" and edit this file to remove
      the mail headers.  Finally, use "Open Local..." under Mosaic's
      "File" menu to view this file ("ics.1c/hot.w3.html") within Mosaic.
