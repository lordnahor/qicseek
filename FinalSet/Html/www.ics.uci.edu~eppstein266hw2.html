<OL>
<LI><B>Lifting transformation</B>.<BR>
A <I>quadratic spline</I> is the curve formed by the set of planar points
(x=f(t),y=g(t)) where f and g are both quadratic polynomials.
Describe how to use the lifting transformation to transform questions
about points and splines to higher-dimensional questions about points
and hyperplanes.
What dimension space does this transformation produce?
What is the function lifting a given point (x,y) into this space?
<P>
<LI><B>Range search</B>.<BR>
An <I>axis-aligned right triangle</I> in the x-y plane is one in which
the two shorter sides are parallel to the x and y axis.
Describe a data structure for, given a point set,
listing all the points inside a query axis-aligned right triangle.
Describe another data structure for, given a weighted point set,
finding the maximum-weight point inside a query axis-aligned right triangle.
What are the query times, preprocessing times, and space complexity
of your data structures?
<P>
(Hint: combine recursive orthogonal range searching with onion layers.)
<P>
<LI><B>Recursive decomposition</B>.<BR>
Describe algorithms for testing whether a given point in three-dimensional space is inside a given polyedron,
<UL>
<LI>...using the inner recursive decomposition of the polyhedron
<LI>...using the outer recursive decomposition of the polyhedron
</UL>
Which did you find easier?
