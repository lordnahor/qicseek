The authors addressed the problem of selecting the cheapest possible route
between a source and a destination in a graph in which edges are owned by
self agents.  The VCG mechanism is the unique efficient mechanism, however
the payments made by VCG can be unacceptably high in some graphs.  In
this paper, they study the VCG overpayment in different types of graphs
with unit and uniformly random edge costs.  The results suggests that for
common real-world networks, the VCG payments will not e too much higher
than the true costs.
