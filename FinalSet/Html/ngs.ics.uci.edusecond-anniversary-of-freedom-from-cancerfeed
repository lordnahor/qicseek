		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ramesh,

I&#039;m on a bit of a mission to spread the word that the best way to combat cancer - any type of cancer is to improve one&#039;s immune system by balancing the body&#039;s minerals and vitamin intake.

As Linus Pauling believed, every disease is caused by a mineral deficiency.  My father-in-law was diagnosed with lung cancer 5 years ago, and while in the care of bumbling doctors, he was given 3 months to live.  

I&#039;m glad to say he&#039;s alive and well, and his lung cancer has not grown a bit because we opted not to do any drugs, or chemotherapy, or radiation.  What we resorted to do was to improve his diet and make his body stronger.  He&#039;s 81 and doing great.   We make sure he eats properly, and gets enough sunshine - because vitamin D is critical to retarding the growth of any type of cancer. 

Best of luck,
Berta]]></description>
