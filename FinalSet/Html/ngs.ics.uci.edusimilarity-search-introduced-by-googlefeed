		<description><![CDATA[Okay, it&#039;s nice to see that Step-1 of real image searching seems to be have been accomplished. Now the major work required is to enable user input in the system (that is, Query by Example).  We can notice that the input is still &quot;text&quot; and not &quot;image&quot;. Second development would be to set up a relevance feedback system to refine search results with every search. Indeed Google&#039;s main challenge is to use content based retrieval (CBIR) methods and also maintain the scalability. The latest I found during my research was this: http://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~deselaers/fire/
We will surely see above two developments hitting the web in near future. It&#039;s just about time.
Cheers,

		<description><![CDATA[I need to agree that this Google Similar Images is a good idea.  It will lessen the time for looking  images because it already provides related information. Well, you said it right more better than live.com]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google Lab&#039;s revised similarity image search has garnered wide media coverage.  To compare and contrast have a look at http://www.xyggy.com/image.php.  Drag and drop ONE or MORE images from the left hand set of images into the search oval.  Results will appear on the right hand side.  

Which is cooler and more useful?  Xyggy or Google image search?
