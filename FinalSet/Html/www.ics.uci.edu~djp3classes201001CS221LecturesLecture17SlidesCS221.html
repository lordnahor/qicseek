Patterson  Advances in Link Analysis “The Impact of Crawl Policy on Web Search Effectiveness” by Fetterly, Craswell, Vinay  SIGIR2009 “Link Analysis for Private Weighted Graphs” by Sakuma, Kobayashi SIGIR2009  The Impact of Crawl Policy on Web Search Effectiveness Crawl Selection Policy A good page, not crawled, is not returned for a query Deciding what to crawl can make a difference with finite resources    The Impact of Crawl Policy on Web Search Effectiveness For a web page to get to a user in a search result many things must go well A failure results in worse quality and unhappy users Instead of holding the corpus constant and testing retrieval algorithms, this paper varies the corpus through crawl strategies     The Impact of Crawl Policy on Web Search Effectiveness Successful crawling depends on  size of crawl crawl selection policy     The Impact of Crawl Policy on Web Search Effectiveness Improving crawling depends on  Increasing the size of the crawl, or  using a better crawl selection policy     The Impact of Crawl Policy on Web Search Effectiveness Improving crawling depends on  Increasing the size of the crawl, or  using a better crawl selection policy     The Impact of Crawl Policy on Web Search Effectiveness This paper Provides a metric to compare crawls evaluates 4 different crawl policies one-time incrementally  The Impact of Crawl Policy on Web Search Effectiveness A naive approach to crawling would be to start from a seed set every time A smarter approach is to crawl based on quality metrics derived from the last crawl   The Impact of Crawl Policy on Web Search Effectiveness 4 crawl selection policies breadth first search (baseline) indegree trans-domain indegree highest PageRank Not done: focussing crawl based on queries with lame results  The Impact of Crawl Policy on Web Search Effectiveness Options for evaluating a crawl Efficiency politeness queueing data structures resource allocation “Goodness” of collected corpus  The Impact of Crawl Policy on Web Search Effectiveness Goodness can be measure by “RankMass” Like precision over PageRank What % of top N pages did you crawl? Requires a big crawl for ground truth Requires crawler  Alternative is Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)  The Impact of Crawl Policy on Web Search Effectiveness metric: maxNDCG eliminates variation based on retrieval algorithm several thousand test queries 10,570 sampled queries (Microsoft) maxNDCG = “how many of the web pages returned by 3 large web search engines are in your crawl set?” weighted by human judged relevance  The Impact of Crawl Policy on Web Search Effectiveness metric: NDCG@K G(j) is user rating of document at position j  The Impact of Crawl Policy on Web Search Effectiveness metric: click utility sum of clicks on pages in crawled corpus requires search engine support (Microsoft) not weighted by rank in query results (multiple queries) like RankMass for clicks    The Impact of Crawl Policy on Web Search Effectiveness incremental metric: Jaccard coefficent High Jaccard coefficient means not many pages changed between crawls  The Impact of Crawl Policy on Web Search Effectiveness incremental metric: churn How many pages came and went during the iterative crawls Users care because it makes the search engine look stable  The Impact of Crawl Policy on Web Search Effectiveness Systems issues Hard to compare crawls when the Internet is dynamic Real-time events are irreproducible network transience For this experiment Sandbox crawl (basically a big cache) First time a URL is requested it is cached. Time is not being evaluated When required equal scores are randomly selected for a ranked list (like trans-domain indegree)  The Impact of Crawl Policy on Web Search Effectiveness Experiments Baseline breadth-first crawl starting at open-directory 930,320,010 filtered pages recovered   The Impact of Crawl Policy on Web Search Effectiveness Experiments - Single Crawl   The Impact of Crawl Policy on Web Search Effectiveness Experiments - Single Crawl   The Impact of Crawl Policy on Web Search Effectiveness Experiments - Hybrid Crawl   The Impact of Crawl Policy on Web Search Effectiveness Experiments - Domain Limits on PageRank Crawl   The Impact of Crawl Policy on Web Search Effectiveness Experiments - Iterative Behavior   The Impact of Crawl Policy on Web Search Effectiveness Experiments - Iterative Set Similarity   The Impact of Crawl Policy on Web Search Effectiveness Experiments - Iterative Self-Similarity   The Impact of Crawl Policy on Web Search Effectiveness Experiments - Iterative Stability   The Impact of Crawl Policy on Web Search Effectiveness Take Away Use a combination of TD and PageRank to guide crawl Don’t overcrawl one domain maxNDCG is a measure comparable to user click utility  Advances in Link Analysis “The Impact of Crawl Policy on Web Search Effectiveness” by Fetterly, Craswell, Vinay  SIGIR2009 “Link Analysis for Private Weighted Graphs” by Sakuma, Kobayashi SIGIR2009"/>
