		<description><![CDATA[This is an interesting concept.
It closely follows the way that the human mind is &quot;wired &quot;in that we make connections based on several different criteria.

When we experience a significant event it affects the sytem that contains and experiences the experiences. 
I guess that this is a long winded way of saying that everything  we experience goes through our brain and in so doing also goes through filters.
These filters are contextual and sort out the information into Bits ( or bytes ) that make sense to what we have already decided these types of experiences actually mean.

Great article and thought provoking,
