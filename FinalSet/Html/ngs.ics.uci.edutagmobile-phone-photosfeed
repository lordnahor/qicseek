				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While playing with my Android, and later with iPhone, I realized how much improvement has taken place in the camera technology in these devices â€“ also in other mobile phones.  One gets a fairly decent camera in a phone, and there is enough memory to store thousands of photos.  Many cameras also offer special scene modes and even special effects to be applied to a photo if so desired.  These cameras definitely encourage people to take lots of photos.  And one can easily notice that â€“ even in emerging countries.</p>
<p>It is surprising, however, that photo browsing approach on an android or even iPhone  still remains very primitive.  All photos captured on an android  go to the â€˜galleryâ€™.  And this gallery allows you to browse through the photos either in thumbnail mode.  Granted that flicking through photos is fun.  And that many systems give a facility to create a slideshow.  These things are not bad to go through and find photos that you may want to retrieve or find use or share them, if the number of photos is not too large.  As the number of photos goes to hundreds and then to thousands, these playful methods starts becoming punishment.  It is amazing how the volume of data changes how we interact with it.  When we took just a few photos, it was OK to sequentially browse them.  But with the culture that has emerged with the new technology, this approach is as if we have to still deal with our music in the days of sequential reel-to-reel tapes.  We were forces to go through our music sequentially.  We were used to listening to all our music that way â€“ it was too much work to find songs that we wanted to listen to.  There was no concept of playlists.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, our photo galleries on our mobile phones as well as elsewhere have not much evolved from the days of traditional Kodak Moments.  It will be great if we could modernize photo galleries in our mobile phones so we can browse them using techniques of this decade rather than using those from several decades ago.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If one looks at all the emerging photo services that are built using confluence of mobile phone cameras, Internet, and social networks then one may start thinking that photos, and visual memory, is a fleeting experience.  From Instagrams of the world to PicPlz, Path, Color, and many many more systems that emerged in the last several months and even gained significant buzz are implicitly based on an assumption that people believe in &#8216;shoot-share-forget&#8217; about photos.  They will spontaneously shoot a photo because they have their mobile phone camera with them and then share it with one or more people and thats the end of the life of a photo.</p>
<p>The beauty of the photo, unlike sound, is that it represents exeperience of a moment and many of those moments are considered extremely precious, some are not as precious but are still precious enough for people to reminisce them by using photos.  After the current fad of &#8216;shoot-share-forget&#8217; disappears soon, people will go back to collecting their visual memories which are to be shared but are also to be treasured as ones life&#8217;s pleasent moments.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Comes 2009 (which conveniently I consider for this discussion as 2010) and we enter the new decade &#8212; lets call Teens.  Teens brought smartphones, first iPhone and then Android.  The camera in these phones is not the same quality as P6000 or D80, but is acceptable quality.  But these devices (yes I carry both â€“ call me crazy) have excellent quality camera from my perspective because now I rarely print photos and the 5MegaPixel is more than enough quality to view on a monitor and on my phone.  More importantly, I can immediately send photos I capture at the moment and of the moment to Facebook or email them to relevant people.  The luxury I did not have earlier.  Now I can literally share moments with my friends and family 10,000 miles away within moments of those key moments.  Moreover, I can broadcast them or directly share them.  And the cost to do this is the most attractive â€“ ZERO.  And the convenience â€“ well I have my phones always with me â€“ so I donâ€™t need to carry any special camera with me.  </p>
<p>So now I donâ€™t have to even think of my cameras.  I noticed that first my D80 stopped traveling with me.  And in the last two trips it did not travel even to places where normally it would have gone.  But what is more surprising is that though P6000 went with me but did not come out of my bag.  All the photos that I took were taken using VisR on Android, and many were taken using iPhone camera.  I also took some photos using Instagram and in Foursquare.  This trip I did not take any photos using picplz or Path â€“ I have no explanation â€“ just that is what happened.  Several photos that I took were shared immediately on Facebook and I even heard comments from people within minutes.  In one case even got some helpful hints.</p>
<p>And this is just the beginning of Teens.  All indications are that photography is going through same temperamental period as Teens go through.  Based on all technological progress ranging from hardware to software to social practices to spread of cameras in developing countries to more than 75% of all humans, I am eagerly waiting to see how this field is going to evolve.  I must say, however, that I am very optimistic about the future of photography as a experience sharing medium.</p>
