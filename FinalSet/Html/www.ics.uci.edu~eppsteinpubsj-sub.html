We provide a graph-theoretic characterization of three classes of
nonconvex polyhedra with axis-parallel sides, analogous to Steinitz's
theorem characterizing the graphs of convex polyhedra.

We characterize the graphs that can be isometrically embedded into the
Cartesian product of two trees (partial double dendrons), and the metric
spaces obtained as the
median complexes of these graphs. These spaces include the space of
geodesic distance in axis-parallel
polygons in the L<sub>1</sub> plane, hence the title. An algorithm based
on lexicographic breadth-first search can be used to recognize partial
double dendrons in linear time.

We give tight bounds on the size of the largest remaining grid minor in
a grid graph from which a given number of vertices have been deleted,
and study several related problems.

A superpattern of a set of permutations is a permutation that contains
as a pattern every permutation in the set. Previously superpatterns had
been considered for all permutations of a given length; we generalize this
to sets of permutations defined by forbidden patterns; we show that
the 213-avoiding permutations have superpatterns half the length of the
known bound for all permutations, and that any proper permutation
subclass of the 213-avoiding permutations has near-linear superpatterns.
We apply these results to the construction of universal point sets, sets
of points that can be used as the vertices of drawings of all n-vertex
planar graphs. We use our 213-avoiding superpatterns to construct
universal sets of size approximately <i>n</i><sup>2</sup>/4,
and we also construct near-linear universal sets for graphs of bounded
pathwidth.

<li><b>Drawing arrangement graphs in small grids, or how to play
planarity</b>.<br>

<i>21st Int. Symp. Graph Drawing</i>, Bordeaux, France, 2013.<br>
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-03841-4_38"><i>Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci.</i> 8242, 2013, pp. 436-447</a>.<br>
<p>
The <a href="http://planarity.net/">planarity game</a> involves
rearranging a scrambled line arrangement graph to make it planar.
We show that the resulting graphs have drawings in grids of area
<i>n</i><sup>7/6</sup>, much smaller than the quadratic size bound for
grid drawings of planar graphs, and we provide a strategy for
planarizing these graphs that is simple enough for human puzzle solving.
