When I was about three years old, living in New York City, a tow truck
driver named Dietz lived under my bed.   He was about a foot and a
half tall, wore blue overalls and a red baseball hat, and smoked
a cigar.   We played together from morning until night, except when
he had to leave to help a stranded motorist.

<p>
When I was four, my family left New York, and at the time I thought we left America 
behind as well, to settle in New Jersey.  One thing
is for sure, we left Dietz behind and we went our separate ways. From
New Jersey, we moved to Connecticut. I went to college, moved to
New Hampshire, started work and got married.  A few years
later, I moved to California, got a Ph.D., settled down in
a real job in suburbia and raised two beautiful daughters
with a wonderful and loving wife.  I completely lost track
of Dietz, although every once in a while, I thought I detected the faint
odor of his cigar.

<p>
A few years back, I planned to take a flight out of Orange County
Airport when the flight was cancelled due to mechanical problems.
They put me on a shuttle bus on an terrible stormy day to catch a
flight from Ontario Airport.  As we approached the airport, I saw a
sign through the gloom that read "Dietz Towing."  I was thrilled to
see my old friend had also moved to California.  I resisted the
temptation to miss the flight and catch up on old times.

<p>After I returned I always planned to stop in on Dietz, but never
found the time. I was always too busy with my work as chairman of a
large academic department. A few times I had to drive by Ontario and I
always secretly hoped my car would break down so Dietz could come to
my aid.  Once I drove by with the gas tank precariously near empty.

<p>After five years, I decided to step down as chairman so I could
have more time to pursue my research interests and spend time with my
family and friends.  This seemed like the perfect opportunity to catch up
with Dietz.  One Sunday morning, Father's Day in fact, I talked my
wife into going out to Ontario with me to see what had become of
Dietz.

As we approached the shop, I was a little disappointed.
Dietz isn't located in the best part of town, and his shop
isn't the largest.

The shop was closed and surrounded by barbed wired.

I tried calling, but he didn't answer.

When we went around the side, I was finally impressed.
Dietz no longer had a single tow truck, but a whole fleet.
He had the largest tow truck I've ever seen.  I bet he
can tow ten tow trucks with that truck.

Some may mock me or humor me, but I plan on going out to see Dietz when he is open real soon.
