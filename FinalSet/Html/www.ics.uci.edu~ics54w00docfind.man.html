NAME
     find - find files

SYNOPSIS
     find path ... expression

DESCRIPTION
     The find  utility recursively descends the directory hierar-
     chy for each path seeking files that match a Boolean expres-
     sion written in the primaries given below.

     find  will be able to descend to arbitrary depths in a  file
     hierarchy  and  will not fail due to path length limitations
     (unless a path operand specified by the application  exceeds
     PATH_MAX requirements).

<a name="operands">OPERANDS</a>
     The following operands are supported:

     path      A path name of a starting point in  the  directory
               hierarchy.

     expression
               The first argument that starts with a -, or is a !
               or  a  (,  and  all  subsequent  arguments will be
               interpreted as an expression made up of  the  fol-
               lowing  primaries  and operators.  In the descrip-
               tions, wherever n is used as a  primary  argument,
               it  will  be  interpreted  as  a  decimal  integer
               optionally preceded by a plus  (+)  or  minus  (-)
               sign, as follows:

               +n        more than n

               n         exactly n

               -n        less than n

  <a name="expressions">Expressions</a>
     Valid expressions are:

     -atime n  True if the file was  accessed  n  days  ago.  The
               access  time  of directories in path is changed by
               find  itself.

     -cpio device
               Always true; write the current file on  device  in
               cpio  format (5120-byte records).

     -ctime n  True if the file's status was changed n days ago.

     -depth    Always  true;  causes  descent  of  the  directory
               hierarchy  to  be  done  so  that all entries in a
               directory  are  acted  on  before  the   directory
               itself.
                This can  be  useful  when  find   is  used  with
               cpio(1)  to  transfer  files that are contained in
               directories without write permission.

     <a name="exec">-exec command</a>
               True if the executed command returns a zero  value
               as  exit status.  The end of command must be punc-
               tuated by an escaped semicolon.  A  command  argu-
               ment {} is replaced by the current path name.

     -follow   Always true; causes symbolic links to be followed.
               When  following  symbolic links, find  keeps track
               of the directories visited so that it  can  detect
               infinite  loops;  for  example,  such a loop would
               occur if a symbolic link pointed to  an  ancestor.
               This  expression should not be used with the -type
               l expression.

     -fstype type
               True if the filesystem to which the  file  belongs
               is of type type.

     -group gname
               True if the file belongs to the  group  gname.  If
               gname  is  numeric  and  does  not  appear  in the
               /etc/group file, it is taken as a group ID.

     -inum n   True if the file has inode number n.

     -links n  True if the file has n links.

     -local    True if the file system type is not a remote  file
               system  type  as  defined  in the /etc/dfs/fstypes
               file. nfsis used as the default remote  filesystem
               type if the/etc/dfs/fstypes file is not present.

     -ls       Always true; prints  current  path  name  together
               with  its  associated  statistics.  These  include
               (respectively):

                  +  inode number
                  +  size in kilobytes (1024 bytes)
                  +  protection mode
                  +  number of hard links
                  +  user
                  +  group
                  +  size in bytes
                  +  modification time.

               If the file is a special file the size field  will
               instead   contain   the  major  and  minor  device
               numbers.

               If the file is a symbolic link the pathname of the
               linked-to  file  is  printed preceded by `->'. The
               format is identical to  that  of  ls  -gilds  (see
               ls(1)).   Note:  Formatting  is  done  internally,
               without executing the ls  program.

     -mount    Always true; restricts the search to the file sys-
               tem  containing  the directory specified. Does not
               list mount points to other file systems.

     -mtime n  True if the file's data was modified n days ago.

     -name pattern
               True if pattern matches  the  current  file  name.
               Normal  shell file name generation characters (see
               sh(1)) may be used. A backslash (\) is used as  an
               escape  character  within the pattern. The pattern
               should be escaped or quoted when find  is  invoked
               from the shell.

     -ncpio device
               Always true; write the current file on  device  in
               cpio  -c format (5120 byte records).

     -newer file
               True if the current file has  been  modified  more
               recently than the argument file.

     -nogroup  True if the file belongs to a  group  not  in  the
               /etc/group file.

     -nouser   True if the file belongs to  a  user  not  in  the
               /etc/passwd file.

     -ok command
               Like -exec except that the generated command  line
               is printed with a question mark first, and is exe-
               cuted only if the user responds by typing y.

     -perm [-]mode
               The mode argument is used to represent  file  mode
               bits.  It  will  be  identical  in  format  to the
               <symbolicmode> operand described in chmod(1),  and
               will  be  interpreted as follows. To start, a tem-
               plate will be assumed  with  all  file  mode  bits
               cleared.  An op symbol of:

               +         will set the appropriate  mode  bits  in
                         the template;

               -         will clear the appropriate bits;

               =         will  set  the  appropriate  mode  bits,
                         without  regard  to the contents of pro-
                         cess' file mode creation mask.

               The op symbol of - cannot be the  first  character
               of  mode;  this avoids ambiguity with the optional
               leading hyphen. Since the initial mode is all bits
               off, there are not any symbolic modes that need to
               use - as the first character.

               If the hyphen is omitted, the primary will  evalu-
               ate  as true when the file permission bits exactly
               match the value of the resulting template.

               Otherwise, if mode is prefixed by  a  hyphen,  the
               primary  will evaluate as true if at least all the
               bits in the resulting template are set in the file
               permission bits.

     -perm [-]onum
               True if the file permission  flags  exactly  match
               the  octal  number onum (see chmod(1)). If onum is
               prefixed by a minus sign (-), only the  bits  that
               are set in onum are compared with the file permis-
               sion flags, and the expression evaluates  true  if
               they match.

     -print    Always true; causes the current path  name  to  be
               printed.

     -prune    Always yields true. Do not examine any directories
               or files in the directory structure below the pat-
               tern just matched. (See EXAMPLES).  If  -depth  is
               specified, -prune will have no effect.

     -size n[c]
               True if the file is n blocks long (512  bytes  per
               block).  If  n  is followed by a c, the size is in
               bytes.

     -type c   True if the type of the file is c, where c  is  b,
               c,  d,  D,  f,  l, p, or s for block special file,
               character special  file,  directory,  door,  plain
               file, symbolic link, fifo (named pipe), or socket,
               respectively.

     -user uname
               True if the file belongs to  the  user  uname.  If
               uname  is  numeric  and does not appear as a login
               name in the /etc/passwd file, it  is  taken  as  a
               user ID.

     -xdev     Same as the -mount primary.

  <a name="complex">Complex Expressions</a>
     The primaries may be combined using the following  operators
     (in order of decreasing precedence):

     1)   ( expression )
               True  if  the  parenthesized  expression  is  true
               (parentheses  are special to the shell and must be
               escaped).

     2)   ! expression
               The negation of a primary  (!  is  the  unary  not
               operator).

     3)  expression [-a] expression
               Concatenation of primaries (the and  operation  is
               implied by the juxtaposition of two primaries).

     4)  expression -o expression
               Alternation of primaries (-o is the or operator).

     Note:  When you use find  in conjunction with cpio , if  you
     use  the  -L option with cpio  then you must use the -follow
     expression with find  and vice versa. Otherwise  there  will
     be undesirable results.

     If no expression is present, -print  will  be  used  as  the
     expression. Otherwise, if the given expression does not con-
     tain any of the primaries -exec, -ok or  -print,  the  given
     expression will be effectively replaced by:

     ( given_expression ) -print

     The -user, -group, and -newer primaries each  will  evaluate
     their respective arguments only once.

USAGE
     See largefile(5) for the description of the behavior of find
     when encountering files greater than or equal to 2 Gbyte ( 2
    **31 bytes).

<a name="examples">EXAMPLES</a>
     Example 1: Writing out the hierarchy directory

     The following commands are equivalent:

     example% find .
     example% find . -print

     They both write out the entire directory hierarchy from  the
     current directory.

     Example 2: Removing files

     Remove all files in your home directory named a.out  or  *.o
     that have not been accessed for a week:

     example% find $HOME \( -name a.out -o -name '*.o' \) \
      -atime +7 -exec rm {} \;

     Example 3: Printing all file names but skipping SCCS  direc-
     tories

     Recursively print all file names in  the  current  directory
     and below, but skipping SCCS directories:

     example% find . -name SCCS -prune -o -print

     Example 4: Printing all file names and  the  SCCS  directory
     name

     Recursively print all file names in  the  current  directory
     and  below,  skipping  the contents of SCCS directories, but
     printing out the SCCS directory name:

     example% find . -print -name SCCS -prune

     Example 5: Testing for the newer file

     The following command is basically  equivalent  to  the  -nt
     extension to test(1):

     example$ if [ -n "$(find
     file1 -prune -newer file2)" ]; then

          printf %s\\n "file1 is newer than file2"

     Example 6: Selecting a file using 24-hour mode

     The descriptions of -atime, -ctime, and -mtime use the  ter-
     minology n ``24-hour periods''. For example, a file accessed
     at 23:59 will be selected by:

     example% find . -atime -1 print

     at 00:01 the next day (less than 24 hours  later,  not  more
     than one day ago); the midnight boundary between days has no
     effect on the 24-hour calculation.

     Example 7: Printing files matching a user's permission mode

     Recursively print  all  file  names  whose  permission  mode
     exactly  matches  read,  write, and execute access for user,
     and read and execute access for group and other:

     example% find . -perm u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx

     The above could alternatively be specified as follows:

     example% find . -perm a=rwx,g-w,o-w

     Example 8: Printing files with write access for other

     Recursively print all file names whose permission  includes,
     but is not limited to, write access for other:

     example% find . -perm -o+w

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
     See environ(5) for descriptions of the following environment
     variables  that  affect  the execution of find : LC_COLLATE,
     LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES, and NLSPATH.

EXIT STATUS
     The following exit values are returned:

     0         All path operands were traversed successfully.

     >0        An error occurred.

FILES
     /etc/passwd
               password file

     /etc/group
               group file

     /etc/dfs/fstypes
               file that registers distributed file system  pack-
               ages

ATTRIBUTES
     See attributes(5) for descriptions of the  following  attri-
     butes:

     ____________________________________________________________
    |       ATTRIBUTE TYPE        |       ATTRIBUTE VALUE       |

WARNINGS
     The following options are obsolete and will not be supported
     in future releases:

     -cpio device
               Always true; write the current file on  device  in
               cpio  format (5120-byte records).

     -ncpio device
               Always true; write the current file on  device  in
               cpio  -c format (5120 byte records).

NOTES
     When using find  to determine files modified within a  range
     of  time,  one must use the ?time argument before the -print
     argument; otherwise, find  will give all files.
