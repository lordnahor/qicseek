consent for such processing, in both cases with guarantees of non-discrimination and with
the security measures provided for in Article 15.</p>

including genetic data, shall be permitted if it is necessary for the purposes of
preventive medicine, medical diagnosis, the provision of care or treatment or the

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3 &#150; If the data are not collected from the data subject and except
where he already has it, the controller or his representative must provide the data
subject with the information set down in 1 at the time of undertaking the recording of
data or, if a disclosure to third parties is envisaged, no later than the time the data
are first disclosed.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4 &#150; If data are collected on open networks the data subject shall
be informed, except where he is already aware of it, that personal data relating to him
may be circulated on the network without security measures and may be at risk of being
seen and used by unauthorised third parties.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5 &#150; The obligation to provide information may be waived by a legal
provision or decision of the CNPD on the grounds of State security and criminal prevention
or investigation and also in particular for processing for statistical purposes or for the
purposes of historical or scientific research, when the provision of such information
proves impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort or if recording or disclosure
is expressly laid down by law.</p>

  concerned and the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the data are disclosed;</p>

  processing and of any available information as to their source;</p>

  which does not comply with the provisions of this Act, in particular because of the
  incomplete or inaccurate nature of the data;</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(e) Notification to third parties to whom the data have been disclosed
  of any rectification, erasure or blocking carried out in compliance with (d), unless this
  proves impossible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2 &#150; In the case of the processing of personal data relating to
State security and criminal prevention or investigation, the right of access may be
exercised by means of the CNPD or another independent authority in whom the law vests
verification of compliance with legislation on the protection of personal data.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3 &#150; In the cases provided for in 6 above the right of access is
exercised by means of the CNPD, securing the constitutional rules applicable, in
particular those guaranteeing freedom of expression and information, freedom of the press
and the professional independence and secrecy of journalists.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4 &#150; In the cases provided for in (2) and (3), if communication of
the data might prejudice State security, criminal prevention or investigation and freedom
of expression and information or the freedom of the press, the CNPD shall only inform the
data subject of the measures taken.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5 &#150; The right of access to information relating to health data,
including genetic data, is exercised by means of the doctor chosen by the data subject.</p>

regarding any particular individual, the law may restrict the right of access where there
is clearly no risk of breaching the fundamental rights, freedoms and guarantees of the
data subject, particularly the right to privacy, and when the data are used solely for
purposes of scientific research or are kept in personal form for a period which does not
exceed the period necessary for the sole purpose of creating statistics.</p>

  referred to in Article 6 (d) and (e), to object at any time on compelling legitimate
  grounds relating to his particular situation to the processing of data relating to him,
  and where there is a justified objection the processing instigated by the controller may
  no longer involve those data;</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b) to object, on request and free of charge, to the processing of
  personal data relating to him which the controller anticipates being processed for the
  purposes of direct marketing or any other form of research, or to be informed before
  personal data are disclosed for the first time to third parties for the purposes of direct

this Act, a person may be subject to a decision taken under 1 if that decision is taken in
the course of the entering into or performance of a contract, provided that the request
for the entering into or the performance of the contract has been satisfied, or that there
are suitable measures to safeguard his legitimate interests, particularly arrangements
allowing him to put his point of view.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3 &#150; The taking of a decision under 1 may also be permitted when

destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, in
particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and
against all other unlawful forms of processing. Having regard to the state of the art and
the cost of their implementation, such measures shall ensure a level of security
appropriate to the risks represented by the processing and the nature of the data to be
protected.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2 &#150; Where processing is carried out on his behalf the controller
must choose a processor providing sufficient guarantees in respect of the technical
security measures and organisational measures governing the processing to be carried out,

processor.</p>

the European Commission according to its own procedures, because they provide the adequate
