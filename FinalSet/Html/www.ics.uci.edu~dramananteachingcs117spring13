<p><span class="red">News:</span>
<ul>
<li> Office hours updated.
<li> No class on Tuesday, April 9.
</ul>


<p><span class="h2"> Course overview </span>
<p> This project-based class will focus on the algorithmic design and implementation of vision-based interfaces. Lectures will cover the background for feature extraction from video frames, motion-processing, face and hand tracking, and gesture recognition. Students will be expected to implement algorithms through a series of 5 homework assignment. Students will be required to work in MATLAB for the homework assignments.

<p><span class="h2"> Prerequisites </span>
<p> CS 116 and the following undergraduate courses or their equivalent: ICS 6D/Mathematics 6D, Mathematics 6G or 3A, Mathematics 2A-B, ICS 23, or permission of the instructor.

<p><span class="h2"> The required course materials are available online</span>
<ul>
<p><li> <a href="http://szeliski.org/Book/">Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications</a> by Szeliski. Textbook available online.
<p><li> <a href="http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/9780596516130"> Learning OpenCV </a> by Bradski. Free online access from on-campus. Access from off-campus via the <a href="https://vpn.nacs.uci.edu/">web-based VPN</a>.
</ul>

<p><span class="h2"> Recommended course materials (all in course reserves at Library) </span>
<lu>
<p><li> <em>Computer Vision, A Modern Approach</em> by Forsyth and Ponce. Modern text on computer vision.
<p><li> <em> Robot Vision </em> by Horn. Classic text on machine vision.
</ul>

<p><span class="h2"> Grading </span>
<p> 5 projects worth 20% each. Projects handed in 24 hours early will get 5% extra credit on the assignment (e.g. if the assignment is worth 100 points you will get 5 pts extra credit). Each project will require writing code in <a href="matlab.html">MATLAB</a>, which is available on about 34 machines in the CS 364 lab - the machines are in 3 rows front of the lab assistant's desk and to the left of this desk as you face away from it. 

<p><span class="h2"> Classroom Policies </span>
You are asked to be respectful of your student colleagues and instructor in class, not being disruptive or otherwise distracting others in the classroom. This includes turning off cell-phones and not using your laptops during class.

<p><span class="h2">Academic honesty</span>
<p> Homeworks can be discussed, but each student must independently write up their own solutions. In particular, no sharing of code. Please see the university policy on academic honesty. It is fine to use reference materials found online, but do not search for homework solutions. Rather, students are strongly encouraged to ask questions at both office hours and on the class discussion group. 

<p><span class="h2">Acknowledgemnts</span> 
<p>I gladly acknowledge a host of other instructors for making their teaching materials available online.
