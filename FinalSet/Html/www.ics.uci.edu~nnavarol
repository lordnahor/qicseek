<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a fourth year Ph.D. Candidate at University of California, Irvine.  My adviser is Padhraic Smyth and I am a part of the UCI Datalab group, a group whose research interests involve probabilistic modeling and analyzing datasets.  I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science and minor in Mathematics at California State University San Bernardino in 2009, and my M.S. degree in Computer Science at University of California, Irvine in 2011.

<h1>Research Interests</h1>
<p>My current research involves probabilistic modeling of email behavior.  In particular, I'm interested in analyzing the email behavior for individuals and, for each individual, learn the following:
<ul>
<li>common groups of people (friends, family, research groups, etc) the individual emails</li>
<li>the time-varying interaction between the individual and these groups of people</li>
</ul>

<p>I am also interested in modeling large datasets that contain noisy and/or missing data, such as large sensor networks (traffic sensors, weather sensors, etc) tend to have these characteristics.  Models that handle such datasets must be able to both accurately and efficiently describe the underlying relationships of the dataset.

<h1>Previous Research</h1>
<h2>Bayesian Data Reduction Algorithm</h2>
<p>I worked with Arturo Concepcion and David Turner at CSUSB on benchmarking the performance of Bayesian Data Reduction Algorithm (BDRA), developed by Robert S. Lynch.  BDRA is a probabilistic classifier that eliminates "irrelevant" features from a labeled training dataset in order to improve the accuracy of classifying test datasets.  We developed experiments to compare classification errors between BDRA and an Artificial Neural Network, and showed that in many cases BDRA can acheive smaller classification errors.

<h2>Minimizing Knot Energies</h2>
<p>In Summer 2008, I worked with Rolland Trapp in the Mathematics department at CSUSB on optimizing the structure of "knots", arrays of 3-dimensional vertices that represent loopy strings.  The vertices and angles between edges define various energies, such as curvature energy (how curved the string is).  We developed algorithms that manipulated the locations of vertices in order to minimize these energies, while maintaining overall structure.

<h2>Evaluating Clustering Algorithms</h2>
<p>In Summer 2008, I worked with Haiyan Qiao at CSUSB on developing numerous clustering algorithms.  I evaluated the performance of these algorithms using multiple metrics, including the Dunn Index and Davies-Bouldin Index.

<h2>Different Approaches to Cell Segmentation</h2>
<p>In Summer 2007, I participated in the <a href="http://www.bioimage.ucsb.edu/outreach-and-traning/summer-internships">Bio-Image Internship at UCSB</a>, an internship that focused on developing programs and tools for biologists to use.  I worked with Luca Bertelli on implementing several existing image segmentation algorithms (such as normalized graph cuts and the fast marching method).  We also developed a competitive algorithm similar to fast marching method, using only pixel colors.  We applied the algorithms on images of cat retina to detect photoreceptors and describe their characteristics, and to images of breast cancer cells in order to detect various nuclei and their patterns.
