<LI><A NAME="QQ2"><B>Now with the answer to question number one answered, What is the correct percentage to answer number 1?  a)5% b)20% c)35%</B></A><br>
My answer is...<a href="http://phwww.cwis.uci.edu/cgi-bin/phwww">b)20%</a>   
This answer gives insight into into the world of art 
and how much or how little the world of art is appreciated in other countries   <p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>
<LI><A NAME="QQ3"><B>What is it called when a form of a sexual reproduction only involves on egg? </B></A><br>
My answer is... <a 
href="http://ea.oac.uci.edu/indiv/students.html">parthenogenis, It is the 
process of one egg being able to reproduce itself without engaging in the 
act of sexual intercourse. This process would be very useful if you and 
your partner were not on very good terms</a> 
 

<LI><A NAME="QQ4"><B>What is a chain of Amino Acids linked together, fold and coil in a specific chain sequence according to its genetic make-up?</B></A><br>
My answer is... <it> "Protein". Your body is made of up of many 
proteins and proteins are the building blocks for everything. According to 
Professor Hoffman in the U.C.I biology department proteins are specifically 
designed for specific parts of the body in specific codes. If you would
