<LI><A NAME="QQ1"><B>Where are law schools which you are interested in on 
the World Wide Web located and what are some of the services the school 
offers to students? </B></A><br>
The law schools on the World Wide Web are located in the law schools and 
law firms on the WWW URL.  They are also located in the WWW virtual 
library of law.  Both of these document URLs have various law schools 
located in their database.  The law schools and law firms document URL 
also has law firms which helps the student to look ahead for after law 
school.  Each of the various schools gives information on how to apply to 
the school, what types of scholarships they offer, and the type of 
financial aid that is available.  There are various resources to which 
you can access the schools themselves.  <A

<LI><A NAME="QQ2"><B>Name two World Wide Web browsers and 
explain their differences.</B></A><br>
 Two World Wide Web browsers are Lynx and Mosaic.  Lynx is a text-only 
World  Wide Web client.  It does not display graphics and therefore is 
much  faster than Mosaic.  
Right now Lynx can be run on UNIX and VMS.  Mosaic is a browser that 
allows you to access sound, binary pictures, moving pictures, as well as 
text.  It is currently the most popular browser, because of these 
assets.  Additionally, it the browser this ICS.1C class is using.  There 
is also a third World Wide Web browser, Netscape, which is gaining ground 
on Mosaic in terms of being the most popular Web browser.<A

<LI><A NAME="QQ3"><B>What is a document URL?</B></A><br>
A document URL is a string of characters that distinguish a resource on the 
internet and identifies the type of media that is being used.  It allows for 
the linking within HTML hypertext read by 
Web browsers.  URLs create information spaces on the Web in terms of the 
protocol used and the spaces represent a big well of knowledge that the 
Web can dip its jug in.The basic format for many URLs is :  
scheme://host:port/path.  
The scheme is one of the ways to retrieve or send information through the 
internet.  The host is the computer that the resource is located in.  The 
port is a number that distinguishesthe service you are requesting from 
the host.  The path is an the location of a resource on a particular 
host. <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/urls.html">URLs</A> & <A

<LI><A NAME="QQ4"><B>Name two URLs that have the latest sports 
information, choose one and give some information on three of the 
major sports.</B></A><br> Two 
URLs that have the latest sports information are Satchel Sports 
and the Mercury Newspaper sports page.  Satchel sports is a very detailed 
sports information server that has everything a sports fan could want.  
It even keeps up to date on sports that are not even in season.  I found 
out information about three of my home teams.  The San Jose Sharks beat 
the Vancouver, British Columbia Canucs by a score of 3 to 1.  The San 
Francisco 49ers released defensive tackle Richard dent because he is 
injured and has a very big salary.  The Golden State Warriors'  Chris 
Mullin injured himself at home when he fell and had a concussion.  It is 
not known when he will be able to return back to basketball.<A

<LI><A NAME="QQ5"><B>Where are some of the current governors in the 
states of the United States located and name at least two governors who 
you did not know before and give some of their responsibilities, and/or 
accomplishments or information about them. </B></A><br>Each of the 
governments of each of 
the states in the United States is listed under the state World Wide Web 
Servers.  The governor of Hawaii is Benjamin Cayetano.  He is responsible 
for the execution of laws and the supervision of the executive 
departments.  The governor of Maryland is William Donald Schaefer.  His 
phone number is (301) 
974-3901.  <A HREF="http://hinc.hinc.hawaii.gov/gov/gov.html">Hawaiin
