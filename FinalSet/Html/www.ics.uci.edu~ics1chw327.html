<h2>About Vula Baliotis</h2>
Name: Vula Baliotis<br>
E-mail: <code>easu1569@ea.oac.uci.edu</code><br>
Major: English and psychology
<p>
Three neat Web finds:
<ol>
<li>Being a full-blooded Greek who lives of bread, olive oil and feta 
cheese, I took it upon myself to look for a pita bread recipe.  
<A 
HREF="http://cray-ymp.acm.stuorg.vt.edu/PetitChef/Recipes/Bread/pita.html">Pita 
bread</A> is useful for so many Greek foods and seems manageable to make!

<li>Another neat thing I found in World Wide Web is a collection about poetry. 
Specifically, there is a section to click on that tells one all about the 
haiku.  Click <A HREF="http://mikan.cc.matsuyama-u.ac.jp/~shiki/Pleasure_of_Haiku.html">here</A> to get haiku 
pleasure.

<li>A great way to take a break and get a few laughs is by looking at the 
<A HREF="http://www.webcom.com/~ctt/comic.html">Comic Relief</A> page under 
the Christian religion section of the ElNet Galaxy. 
This is definitely something the pathologically philosophical could get 
a kick out of!</ol>

<A NAME="Questions"><H2>Questions I can now answer</H2></a>
<ol>
<li><A HREF="#QQ1">What is the relationship between a client and a 
server?</A>
<li><A HREF="#QQ2">What is HTML and what is its purpose?</A>
<li><A HREF="#QQ3">I want to apply to graduate school in English at the 
University of Washington.  What are the admissions requirements?</A>
 <li><A 
HREF="#QQ4">I want to do an independent study with a professor in the 
cognitive sciences department who is working with linguistics.  Who does 
research in this field?</A> 
<li><A HREF="#QQ5">I've heard a Sting version of a song called "Come 
Down in Time" but wasn't sure who wrote it or what the lyrics are.  I 
want to find out this information</A> </ol>

<LI><A NAME="QQ1"><H2>What is the relationship between a client and 
a server?</H2></A>Clients and servers are agents, or programs, 
that work for a purpose--acting on behalf of something.  A client is the 
software that allows users to access and browse the World Wide Web.  Clients
can display HTML pages in their desired format.  They are refered to as 
browsers and respond to a user.  Servers, on the other hand, are computers 
on which the Web documents reside and which runs HTTP software to permit Web 
transactions.  Look into the various <A 
HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Clients">client software products</A> 
and <A 
HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/Overview.html">World-Wide 
Web server software products</A> available for more information.<p><A 
HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a><p>

<LI><A NAME="QQ2"><H2>What is HTML and what is its purpose?</H2></A> HTML 
stands for <B>Hypertext Markup Language</B>.  One uses <A 
HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/html-jpowell">HTML</A> to create a 
Web page.  Web clients display HTML pages according to their coded format.  
HTML is a protocol designed specifically for the Web:  <I>any</I> browser 
can read and display a written document that fits its needs, for html 
carefully defines the document for this purpose.  The reason why html can 
be so versatile for browsers is that it expresses information in raw 
form, without consideration for formatting.  For more information on 
html, go to the <A HREF="http://fire.clarkson.edu/doc/html/htut.html">HTML 
Document Tutorial</A>.<p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of 
questions. </it></a><p>

<LI><A NAME="QQ3"><H2>I want to apply to graduate school in English 
at the University of Washington.  What are the admissions 
requirements?</H2></A> The <A 
HREF="http://www.cac.washington.edu:1180/">
University of Washington Home Page</A> is a good place to start on 
information about the university.  There are photographs, 
descriptions about the university in specific, and about the 
surrounding environment. The University of Washington also 
includes <A 
HREF="http://www.cac.washington.edu:1180/home/catalog/graduate/admiss_grad.html">graduate 
school entrance policies</A>.  A student must have a 
strong GPA (averaging a 3.00 or above) and should have high scores on 
both the general and English subject GRE tests.  Also, the student 
should be able to display consistency in having completed her undergraduate 
program.  For information on fellowships, traineeships, and scholarships offered 
during the admission process, click <A 
HREF="http://www.cac.washington.edu:1180/home/catalog/graduate/fellowships_grad.html">here</A>.

<LI><A NAME="QQ4"><H2>I want to do an independent study with a 
professor in the
cognitive sciences department who is working with linguistics.  Who 
does
research in this field?</H2></A> A couple of professors in the 
school of social sciences do research in 
linguistics.  A good way to start one's search is by getting a broad 
view on who the professors in the <A 
HREF="http://www.socsci.uci.edu/cogsci/personnel/personnel.html">cognitive
science department</A> are.  In this search, one can also find 
descriptions of each professor's research areas.  The two professors 
who conduct
research in linguistics are as follows:  <A 
HREF="http://www.socsci.uci.edu/cogsci/personnel/landau/landau.html">professor 
Barbara Landau</A>, who works with spatial knowledge and language 
learning, and <A 
HREF="http://www.socsci.uci.edu/cogsci/personnel/kean/kean.html">professor 
Mary Louise Kean</A>, who works with linguistic theory and 
biological foundations of higher mental processes.

<LI><A NAME="QQ5"><H2>I've heard a Sting version of a song called 
"Come Down in Time" but wasn't sure who wrote it or what the lyrics are.  I
want to find out this information.</H2></A> Bernie 
wrote this song, and Sting re-did it.  Press on the song title to get 
Sting's introduction on why he chose to cover this song as well as to 
get a look at the lyrics:  <A 
HREF="http://mmm.dartmouth.edu/pages/wsk/ent/sting.html">Come 
Down in Time</A>.  For more information on numerous lyrics, images and 
sounds by Sting, press <A HREF="http://www.ot.com/sting/">here</A>.  For 
all of you die-hard Sting fans, would you like to get a look at real Sting 
photographs and album covers on your screen?  <A 
HREF="http://www.ot.com/sting/imgpage.html">Sting images</A> will get him 
there!<p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a><p>
