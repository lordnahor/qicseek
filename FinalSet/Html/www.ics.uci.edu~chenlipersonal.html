<Li>Many people are confused by my name, since both "Chen" and "Li" can be a
first name and a last name in Chinese. In fact, "Chen" is my FIRST name,
meaning "Morning," since I was born in a morning. "Li," often written as
"Lee," is my LAST name, which is very popular in Chinese. Most people call
me "Chen." The following is my name in Chinese:&nbsp;<IMG
