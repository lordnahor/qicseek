<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="4">Important note</font></strong><font size="4">:
    The main point of the following tasks is<span style="font-style: italic;"> to describe what exactly you did and what you experienced </span><em style="font-style: italic;"></em>when
    navigating the website of&nbsp; Task
  1, and when working with the technical system you chose in Task 2<em>. </em>  In cases
  of unfulfilled expectations, you should additionally explain what you <em>intended</em> to achieve, <em>why</em> you
  decided to perform a specific action to achieve this aim, and <em>in what respect</em> that action did not deliver what you expected.</font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><strong>Task 1. </strong>Visit <a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/special_features/hf_jp_ii_xxv_en.htm">the
website of Pope John Paul II</a>, find out which speeches he gave in
January 1992 and list the first three of those speeches. Describe <em>stepwise</em> your actions
and experiences when carrying out this task, at a level
of detail that allows one to <em>replicate</em> your steps. It does not really
matter
whether you actually find the correct solution, but try your best.<br>
<em><br>
Note:</em> Only use the Firefox, Safari or Google Chrome web browsers for this task, and
make sure Java/JavaScript is on. Give up after 10 minutes if you don't succeed
(but
still describe your experiences).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><strong>Task 2</strong>.
    Describe a usability problem that you encountered in the past. This is not
    restricted to software
systems, but may relate to any man-made system. Check out <a href="http://www.baddesigns.com/examples.html">http://www.baddesigns.com/examples.html</a>  to refresh your memory.<br>
Explain the problems that you encountered and their impacts on you.
Describe your suggestions for improvement. Do not write more than half
a
page, unless you need more space to describe the problem or your
suggestions. Try to express your experiences in terms of the central
measurable human factors for user interface evaluation that we learned
in class.<br>
