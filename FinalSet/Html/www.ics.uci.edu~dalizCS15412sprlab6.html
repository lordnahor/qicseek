<title>CS 154 Lab 6: Controller, Complete MIPS CPU</title></head>
<body><c></c><h1>Complete MIPS CPU</h1>
<h2> Lab 6</h2>
<p>
  The objective of this lab assignment is to design and implement a CPU. The
  CPU consists of the data path, control unit (your design task in this lab),
  and additional logic needed for PC update and ALU control.</p>
<p>
  The controller should work with the data path you implemented in lab 5. Or you can use <a href="image/datapath.svg" target="_blank">this one</a> as reference.
</p>

<a name="SPEC"><h3>Specification</h3></a>
<p>
  In this lab you will complete the design of the MIPS CPU by adding
  controller unit to lab 5.</p>
<p>
  The control unit consists of a Moore state machine (FSM) with registered
  output and a combination logic that generates "ALU_opcode". Your control
  unit should correspond to a multi-cycle implementation. In a multi-cycle
  implementation, each step takes 1 clock cycle. Following figure gives the
  summary of the steps taken to execute any instruction class:<br>
  </p><center><img src="./image/steps.gif"></center><br>
  Note that the empty entries indicate that particular instruction takes
  fewer than 5 cycles to execute. <b>You also need to implement JAL and I
  type instructions which are not shown in the above table.</b><p>
   Please turn in a <b>"bubble diagram"</b> of the FSM.</p>

<p><b>Memory Unit Description:</b></p>
<p> Memory is byte addressable and has 32 words, where the lower half
stores the instruction, and the upper half stores the data. Even though
lw / sw and IF access the memory, there is no possibility of having
multiple memory requests in the same clock cycle. An example memory is
shown below:<br>

  Please note that the cell immediately under the field "Final code" shows
  the bit number of each instruction bit.<p>
  <b>Be careful for memory write instructions. Do not overwrite the instructions.</b></p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>
  Your task is to first design the controller
  (<a href="./lab6.zip">control.vhd</a>) and then incorporate it with the
  data path you built in previous labs to make a CPU.&nbsp;</p><p>Inside
entity "lab6" you need to connect the controller with your lab5
datapath. &nbsp;Then, simulate your design using ModelSim. The final
top-level entity "lab6" will only have 2&nbsp;inputs: clk and reset_N.</p>
<p>
  The <a href="./lab6.zip">template VHDL files</a> are provided to you. The
  interface (that is, ports) is already defined. You need to add code for
  functionality in these files to make them work.</p><p>Timing
is very imporant for this lab. The basic idea is to start operation at
the beginning of each cycle, and commit the result to various registers
on the rising edge that ends this cycle.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, in
fetch stage, start memory access in the beginning of each cycle by
generating a pulse on the MemRead signal, also start calculating PC + 4
on the ALU at the same time. Both memory operation and ALU calculation
would have some delay, but the result should be ready by the end of the
cycle. Therefore, at the end of this cycle, on the rising edge of the
clock, new PC (PC+4) is committed to the PC register, and new
instruction is committed to the IR register.</p><p>Another example, in
decode stage, 2 things happen: register access, branch target
calculation. So in the beginning of this cycle, we would use rs and rt
to read the register file. At the same time, we calculate the branch
target [ PC + Sign_extend(Immediate &amp; "00") ]. Both operations will
have some delay, but the result should be ready by the end of the
cycle. So on the rising edge that terminates this cycle, register
values are committed to RegA and RegB, at the same time branch target
is committed to ALUOut.</p><p>In order to achieve this, the control
signals should be stable on the clock edge. Especially the write enable
signals (PCUpdate, IRWrite, RegWrite). We may need to use "after 1 ns"
in the signal assignments.</p><h3>Verification</h3>
<p>
  To start, use the program segment given above to test your design. Then,
  develop your own program segment(s) for more rigorous testing. Test your
  design in a step-by-step fashion, e.g., make sure that your CPU executes
  the R-format instructions correctly and then addresses the others. The
  program segment to be used during the demo WILL BE different from the one
  above).</p>
<p>You need to test the following:<br>
</p><ol>
  <li>Memory access instruction (LW - 5 steps, SW - 4 steps) </li>
  <li>ALU Computation (I or R type instruction, 4 steps)</li>
  <li>Branch Equal/Not Equal. (3 steps)</li>
  <li>Jump. (J, JAL - 3 steps)</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Minimal requirement for this lab is fully functionally correct design i.e.
  ModelSim project with the test bench showing that your design satisfies
  all previous requirements:<br>
   - Correct execution of a given code fragment.<br>
   - Execution of each instruction in the specified number of steps
     (defined above). The time interval between two consecutive rising
     edges is 40 ns.</p>
