				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>VisR has new version available on Android phones.  The new version works effortlessly on your android mobile phones.  Even if you don&#8217;t take photos using VisR, but other cameras &#8212; including the native camera &#8212; that put photos in the gallery of the phone, VisR will organize them in events, will allow you to search them based on type of events, people, places, and dates.  You can also edit events and annotate them.  The system helps you even when you did not use it to take and organize photos explicitly.  It acts like your personal butler &#8212; always working for you.  You can also share events (all or some photos) on facebook, twitter, or using email.  VisR is for sharing Visual Events, not just photos.</p>
<p>This system is also supported by the back end where all your shared photos are collected and you can share them with any body.  Photos from all users will also be available there and you could visualize them based on multiple search criteria.  </p>
<p>And the system is currently in its very early version.  All capabilities will be refined soon and new powerful introduced.  So if you have an android, download it from marketplace and enjoy.   For iPhone users, please wait for a bit more.</p>
<p>(Disclaimer:  I am a co-founder of mChron, whis is behind VisR.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been working with a team of entrepreneurs in designing a Visual Sharing and Reflection system based primarily on mobile phones.    It is nice to see that this application, called VisR, is now released on Android. From the description of the application,</p>
<blockquote><p>
VisR:</p>
<p>VisR helps you spontaneously capture, share, organize, and reflect on moments effortlessly.  Seize the moments and relive with friends and family. Never again spend countless tedious hours searching for and organizing pictures on your phone.  </p>
<p>Do you love sharing  experiences, but find it aggravating to locate the perfect picture to describe it?  VisR removes this issue. VisR automagically classifies and organizes photos utilizing information readily available on your mobile phone in a what, when, where, and who form that is specific to you. You can find the photo of interest and with a few taps post it to your favorite place such as Facebook or Twitter.
</p></blockquote>
<p>iPhone application is coming soon.</p>
<p>Currently VisR is free and is also supported by a website where you can see all photos shared by you and others.  As usual, what you see is a very early functionality of this system.  The team wants to move fast and make an application that allows you to share your moments (may be using special effects and special lenses) spontaneously, but also effortlessly organize all the photos that you take in a form natural for you to access and share.  It uses events to organize photos but these events, unlike many current systems, and not just the date, but use multiple sources to identify them.</p>
<p>I am very happy to share this News with you.  I do intend to use all the feedback and work with the team in refining the system so my almost 20 year old dream of organizing and accessing photos and other visual media may become reality soon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pinaki Sinha finished his doctoral dissertation (under my supervision) on automatic summarization of personal photo collections.  As he states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Photo taking and sharing devices (e.g., smart phones, digital cameras, etc) have become<br />
extremely popular in recent times. Photo enthusiasts today capture moments of their personal<br />
lives using these devices. This has resulted in huge collections of photos stored in<br />
various personal archives. The exponential growth of online social networks and web based<br />
photo sharing platforms have added fuel to this fire. According to recent estimates [46],<br />
three billion photos are uploaded on the social network Facebook per month. This photo<br />
data overload has created some major challenges. One of the them is automatic generation<br />
of representative overviews from large photo collections. Manual browsing of photo<br />
corpora is not only tedious, but also time inefficient. Hence, development of an automatic<br />
photo summarization system is not only a research but also a practical challenge. In this<br />
dissertation, we present a principled approach for generation of size constrained overview<br />
summaries from large personal photo collections.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Considering the importance of the problem created by advances in photo related technology, this dissertation addresses<br />
and makes good progress towards solving an important problem for many people.  Very good dissertation.<br />
Congratulations, Pinaki, for a job well-done.</p>
