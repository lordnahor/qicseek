		<description><![CDATA[Well said Rajesh,

In fact, though the numbers are huge, the per user spending capacity is what that will decide the actual potential of this market. India has a peculiar market as of now with a large prepaid market, and very less premium users. But the time is ripe for big players to come in, although the call tariff is at a flat low rate these days.

The more the merrier!

Best,
