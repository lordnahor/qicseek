<TABLE border=10><TR><TD><FONT SIZE=+2>Mendel Langsam</FONT> (1854 - Dec 24, 1932), son of <B>Pesach Langsam</B>, was married to Chaya/Sarah/Jennie. Mrs. Barbara Blosveren related that her father told her Mendel shot a man and had to escape, fleeing Jaroslaw, Poland. Mendel had five known children. His NYC death record lists him as living in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, NY as a retired tailor. He was in the USA since 1886 and is buried at Mt. Zion Cemetery (with a synagogue society - Independent Congregation Ohel Itzchok Anshe Zurawner, associated with <a href="zhuravno.htm">Zhuravno</a>, in Ukraine, formerly Galicia, Path 10 Left, Gate Road) in Flushing, NY.Imigration records show him leaving thru Hamburg on his way to New York via Liverpool. He arrived in New York with 3 other Langsam family members on 27 May 1885. They must have gone back, becuase Mendel and Sure (Sarah) show up again leaving Hamburg on 10 Sep 1886.
