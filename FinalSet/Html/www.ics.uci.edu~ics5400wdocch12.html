<h2>TCP/IP</h2>
Network hardware allows sending packets of data
(of limited size) from one computer to another.  
<p>Higher level protocols
are needed to solve the following problems:
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Routing.</b>
<dd>With a complex topology such as the Internet's,
<BR>
how do packets efficiently find their way to the appropriate gateways?
<dt>
<b>Virtual circuits.</b>
<dd>Most applications want a continuous, ordered,
full-duplex communications link, not packets.
<dt>
<b>Robustness.</b>
<dd>Checksums, retransmission, packet ordering, and duplicate removal.
</dl>

<p><hr><!--<tt> QQ </tt>--><p>
<h2>TCP/IP Key Points</h2>
<ul>
<li> Transport hardware independence
<li> Vendor independence
<li> Routing packets: Provides for a network of networks.  
This is done by the Internet Protocol (IP) and
managed by ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol).
<li> Message Transport: Build virtual circuits when needed using
the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).
</ul>
<p>

<p><hr><!--<tt> QQ </tt>--><p>
<h2>TCP/IP Network Model</h2>
TCP/IP model of networking has are four layers:
<dl>
<dt><b>Link Layer</b><dd>
Network hardware and device drivers.
<dt><b>Network Layer</b><dd>
Does addressing and routing.  IP and ICMP operate here.
IP layer.
<dt><b>Transport Layer</b><dd>
Enables application programs to communicate
over the network.  TCP and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) operate here.
<dt><b>Application Layer</b><dd>
Applications may define their own protocols: HTTP, telnet,
FTP, SMTP, etc.
</dl>

<p><hr><!--<tt> QQ </tt>--><p>
<h2>The "Other" Network Model</h2>
<p>
Networking classes usually teach the 7 layer ISO Open Systems
Interconnection (OSI) networking model:
<OL>
<li>Physical
<li>Data Link
<li>Network
<li>Transport
<li>Session
<li>Presentation
<li>Application
</OL>
<p>
In addition to the 7 layers, OSI committees specified a set of standard
protocols which in the 1980's were expected to replace TCP/IP.
<p>
When finally implemented, they were found to be inefficient and
underspecified.  
<p>
TCP had by then become established, and the OSI protocols
have largely fallen by the wayside, though many commercial e-mail systems
still use the X.400 family of mail protocols.

<p><hr><!--<tt> QQ </tt>--><p>
<h2>Packets</h2>
<p>
Network data is transmitted in <em>packets.</em> 
<BR>At the hardware level,
packets are often called <em>frames.</em>
<p>
The packet header contains the addresses of where it's coming from and
where it's going to, checksums to verify data integrity, and other
protocol-specific information.
<p>
The packet's body contains data which may represent a packet of
another protocol.  
<p>
As packets move from the application to the hardware,
each layer of software adds its own header information, called
<em>encapsulation.</em>  Upon receipt, of course, each layer removes its
headers as the packet moves upwards to the application.
<p>
This is why it's often called a <em>protocol stack.</em>

<p><hr><!--<tt> QQ </tt>--><p>
<h2>Packet Size</h2>
<p>
Packet size may be limited.
<BR>Most interfaces specify a
<em>Maximum Transmission Unit</em> (MTU).
<BR>Ethernet, for example, has an MTU of 1,500 bytes.
<p>
Because software at the application and transport layers can't know
the MTU limit which will be encountered by their packets, it is the
job of the Internet Protocol (IP) to <I>fragment and reassemble</I>
packets
when necessary to make them fit through a selected interface.
<p>Fragmentation
may also be necessary when a packet moves through several different media;
fragmentation of fragments is quite possible.

<p><hr><!--<tt> QQ </tt>--><p>
<h2>Routing</h2>
<p>
<em>Routing</em> allows packets to cross network boundaries on their way
from system to system.
<p>
Whenever the IP layer receives a packet (it doesn't matter if it came
in from another interface or if it came from application software on this
machine), IP decides what to do with it. 
<p>If it's for the current machine,
IP passes the packet up to the correct transport software above it,
based on information in the packet header.
<p>If it's for another machine,
then IP tries to decide which interface it should use and what hardware
address should be put on the enclosing packet. 
<p>If IP can't find a
suitable place to send the packet, then it is returned with a "network
unreachable" error.

<p><hr><!--<tt> QQ </tt>--><p>
<h2>TCP</h2>
<p>
All higher level protocols (TCP, UDP) in the Internet use IP to route their
packets to their destinations.
<p>
Sometimes packets are lost or destroyed.
<p> UDP doesn't address these problems.
<BR>TCP does.
<p>
For reliable communication, checksums must be employed to determine
if a packet has been corrupted, and a mechanism of acknowledgements,
timeouts, and retransmissions will be needed.
<p>
If there are retransmissions, then duplicates may be received and 
must be discarded.
<p>
If there are multiple routes to a destination, or packets are lost and
retransmitted, then they may arrive out of sending order.
<p>
TCP uses these mechanisms to provide virtual circuit service to applications.

<h2><tt>rlogin</tt>, <tt>rsh</tt>, <tt>rcp</tt></h2>

These commands allow one to assume on a remote host <tt><i>Rhost</i></tt>
the rights of the remote user <tt><i>Ruser</i></tt> on that system.
<p>

All of them depend on <tt>/etc/hosts.equiv</tt> 
and <tt>~<i>Ruser</i>/.rhosts</tt>
on <tt><i>Rhost</i></tt>
<p>
<tt>/etc/hosts.equiv</tt> lists those systems which are considered
equivalent to this one in the sense that a valid login as
<tt><i>Ruser</i></tt> there is considered as proof that the
person should be allowed to operate as <tt><i>Ruser</i></tt> here.
<p>

<tt>~Ruser/.rhosts</tt> lists pairs of the form
"<tt>thatsystem user</tt>" saying that <tt>user@thatsystem</tt> can
operate on this system with the same rights as <tt>Ruser</tt>
has on this system.
<br>If <tt>user</tt> is omitted, its value is understood to be
<tt>Ruser</tt>.

<dl>
<dt><tt><b>rlogin</b> [ <b>-l</b> <i>Ruser</i> ] <i>Rhost</i></tt>
  <dd>Login to <tt><i>Rhost</i></tt> as <tt><i>Ruser</i></tt>
  <br>If <tt><i>Ruser</i></tt> is omitted the login name used on
  <tt><i>Rhost</i></tt> is the same as the login name on this system.
  <br>Suppose that from system S1 you rlogin to S2 and from there
  to S3:
  <tt>~CTRL-Z</tt> suspends all your rlogins back to S1;
  <tt>~~CTRL-Z</tt> suspends only the rlogin from S2 to S3.
<dt><tt><b>rsh</b> [ <b>-n</b> ] [ <b>-l</b> <i>Ruser</i> ] <i>Rhost</i> <i>command</i></tt>
<br><tt><b>rsh</b> <i>Rhost</i> [ <b>-n</b> ] [ <b>-l</b> <i>Ruser</i> ] <i>command</i></tt>
  <dd>On <tt><i>Rhost</i></tt>, acting as <tt><i>Ruser</i></tt>,
  execute the command <tt><i>command</i></tt>.
  <br>If <tt><b>-n</b></tt> is specified, <tt><b>rsh</b></tt> takes its
  input from <tt>/dev/null</tt>.
<dt><tt><b>rcp</b> [ <b>-p</b> ]  <i>file1  file2</i></tt>
<br><tt><b>rcp</b> [ <b>-pr</b> ]  <i>file  directory</i></tt>
<dd>These remote copies act exactly like <tt><b>cp</b></tt> except
that the form of the file and directory names is a bit different.
<br>That form is &nbsp;
<tt>[<i>Ruser</i><b>@</b>]<i>Rhost</i><b>:</b><i>name</i></tt>
<br>Examples: &nbsp; <tt>you@x.y.edu:InYourHomeDir</tt> &nbsp;&nbsp;
<tt>x.y.edu:/users/homes/me</tt>
</dl>

All of these commands present the security problems associated
with transmitting unencrypted information between systems.
<p>
Versions of these commands which used encrypted transmission
between systems are called <tt>slogin</tt>, <tt>ssh</tt>, and <tt>scp</tt>.
<p>
They are often simply considered part of "<tt>ssh</tt>, the secure shell."

<h2>ftp = File Transfer Protocol</h2>

For moving files between systems and remote
manipulations of files and directories.
<p>
When "ASCII" (as opposed to "binary") mode is used,
it compensates for the differences among systems in
in how text files are represented (end of line).
<p>
Note that password is sent unencrypted.

<p><hr><!--<tt> QQ </tt>--><p>
<h2>telnet</h2>

<tt><b>telnet</b> <i>host</i> [ <i>port</i> ] </tt>
<p>
Interactive access to remote systems and services.
<p>
Note that password is sent unencrypted.
<p>
Ability to access ports other than the default (23) can be
very useful.
