<P>
The previous sections covered the creation of deterministic
external predicates.
The nondeterministic predicates can of course use the same macros
as the deterministic ones, however their functionality
is larger in that they are sensitive to the backtracking process.
<P>
A non deterministic Prolog procedure has potentially more than one
solution. When it is first called, a solution is found if possible, and
execution proceeds. If a subsequent goal fails, backtracking occurs,
and an attempt is made to find another solution to the
call of the procedure. To
make this action possible in the procedural language C, <A NAME=tex2html813 HREF="http://www.ecrc.de/eclipse/eclipse.html"><b> ECLiPSe</b></A>
<P>
provides a macro which will take note of the values to be given to the
arguments of an external procedure if an attempt is made  to resatisfy
it. This macro is <tt> Remember()</tt>.
<P>
To illustrate its use, consider the next example,
it shows a C implementation of the Prolog predicate <b> member/2</b>.
As opposed to the well-known Prolog definition this one does not work
backwards, i.e. it will not construct lists when called with the
second argument uninstantiated:
<blockquote> <PRE>int
p_member(velt, telt, vlist, tlist)
value velt, vlist;
type telt, tlist;
{
        pword *p;

        /* we require a list or nil */
        Check_List(tlist);
        /* if the list is empty, we fail */
        if(IsNil(tlist))
        {
                Cut_External;
                Fail;
        }
        /* the tail of the list */
        p = vlist.ptr + 1;
        /* must be dereferenced! */
        Dereference(p);
        /*
        * on backtracking we will get the tail of the list
        * instead of the list itself
        */
        Remember(2, p-&gt;val, p-&gt;tag);
        /*
        * and we behave as the unification
        * of the element and the head
        */
        Return_Unify_Pw(velt, telt,
                vlist.ptr-&gt;val, vlist.ptr-&gt;tag);
}
</PRE>
</blockquote>
To link this C function to a Prolog predicate use b_external/2 as 
follows:
<blockquote> <PRE>b_external(member/2, p_member)
</PRE></blockquote>
In a Prolog program the call 
<blockquote> <PRE>member(X, List)
</PRE></blockquote> 
will succeed if X is
a member of the list List. This is clearly resatisfiable - for example
in the call
<blockquote> <PRE>member(X, [1, 2, 3, 4])
</PRE></blockquote> where X is an uninstantiated variable,
X will first be instantiated to 1, and on resatisfaction of the goal it
will successively be instantiated to 2, 3, and 4 before it finally
fails.
A solution to the call <blockquote> <PRE>member(X, List)
</PRE></blockquote> is found when
X is unified with the head of <i> List</i>
by the <tt> Return_Unify_Pw()</tt> statement in the last line of the
function. When an attempt is made to resatisfy the above clause,
X must be instantiated to another element of <i> List</i>. This will
be done if the procedure is called again with a new instantiation of
its arguments, namely that when the second argument has the value of
the tail of the list which it was given on the previous call.
<P>
The use of the macro <tt> Remember()</tt> makes this new instantiation of the
<A NAME=3655>&#160;</A>
procedure's arguments possible. In an external procedure, the call of
the macro
<blockquote> <PRE>Remember(n, val, tag);
</PRE></blockquote> has the effect that if an attempt is
made to resatisfy the procedure, the value given in argument <tt> n</tt>
<i> of the Prolog procedure</i> will be the Prolog term represented by the
<i> value</i> val and the <i> tag</i> tag. The type of  val must be <tt> value</tt>
and the type of tag must be <tt> type</tt>.
<P>
Thus in the above example, it is required that the procedure be
called with the second argument instantiated to the tail of the list
which was its previous value. So a pointer is taken to the tail
by the assignment of the pointer <tt> p</tt> in the fourth statement,
and the call <blockquote> <PRE>Remember(2, p-&gt;val, p-&gt;tag);
</PRE></blockquote> informs <A NAME=tex2html815 HREF="http://www.ecrc.de/eclipse/eclipse.html"><b> ECLiPSe</b></A>
<P>
that to resatisfy the goal
a call of the Prolog procedure must be made again, with the second argument
instantiated to the object pointed to by <tt> p</tt>.
<P>
Note the use of the <tt> Dereference</tt> macro in the previous
<A NAME=3669>&#160;</A>
example.
<tt> p</tt> is the tail of the list and so to access its value,
it must be dereferenced, even though it will become
<A NAME=3671>&#160;</A>
predicate argument in the next invocation of <tt> p_member</tt> - only
the terms which are arguments of the normal (not after backtracking)
invocation are dereferenced by the system.
<P>
A nondeterministic external predicate is resatisfiable until
it explicitly cuts all following alternatives using
the macro <tt> Cut_External</tt>, i.e.
<A NAME=3674>&#160;</A>
if it uses <tt> Return_Unify</tt> and this unification fails
or if it uses the macro <tt> Fail</tt>, it will be
called immediately again with the newly remembered value, if any.
If it is known that the current solution is the last one,
the macro <tt> Succeed_Last</tt> can be used for a deterministic exit
<A NAME=3678>&#160;</A>
from this external predicate, i.e. the predicate succeeds
and is no longer resatisfiable.
<P>
To perform the backtracking operation, some information must be stored
between one attempt at satisfaction of the goal and an attempt to
resatisfy it.
By this mechanism,
the backtracking of Prolog can be imitated by  the facilities in
C. It is not always possible (and seldom desirable)
to map directly from the  definition of
the procedure in Prolog to an implementation in C. Some ingenuity may
be required. A very simple example is the procedure <b> p/1</b> defined in Prolog
as
<blockquote> <PRE>p(a).
p(b).
p(c).
</PRE>
</blockquote>
This is implemented as a C external by defining the Prolog code
<blockquote> <PRE>p(X) :- p(X, 1).
</PRE></blockquote>
The C external is then written for the procedure <b> p/2</b>, whose
auxiliary second argument serves to count its invocations.
<blockquote> <PRE>int
p_p2(v1, t1, v2, t2)
value v1, v2;
type  t1, t2;
{
        char        *result;
        pword       new;

        /* first check the arguments */
        Check_Integer(t2);
        Check_Output_Atom(t1);
        /* take note of new resatisfaction */
        Make_Integer(&amp;new, v2.nint + 1);
        Remember(2, new.val, new.tag);
        /* get the string that corresponds to the value of v2 */
        switch(v2.nint)
        {
                case 1:
                        result = &quot;a&quot;;
                        break;
                case 2:
                        result = &quot;b&quot;;
                        break;
                case 3:
                        result = &quot;c&quot;;
                        break;
                default:
                        Fail;
        }
        Return_Unify_Atom(v1, t1, Did(result, 0));
}
