		<description><![CDATA[Cho Seung-hui was a quiet child perhaps autistic.  He came to the US when he was 8 and was teased by his peers in school.  He grew up feeling rage, resentment and anger.  He acted out with violence.  
Most people in the US do not know anything about Jainism.  Perhaps someone may consider publishing a newsarticle relevant to the Virginia Tech Massacre.  Also, I wish that someone would expand the Jain section of the &quot;ahimsa&quot; article in Wikipedia.
