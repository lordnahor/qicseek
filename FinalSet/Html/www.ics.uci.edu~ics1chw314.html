with lots of good things and a chance to work with other students.
<li><A HREF="http://cybersight.com/cgi-bin/cs/gw/gw?submit+526+104">I

<A NAME="Questions"><H2>Questions I can now answer</H2></a>

create hypertext links within plain text to eventually create a 
beautiful HTM document?</A>

<LI><A NAME="QQ1"><H2>About Hypertext...</H2></A>
I must begin this with my personal definition and understanding of 
Hypertext.  On entering ICS 1c I did not have a clue about what 
hypertext was. <A HREF= "http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Terms.html"> 
Hypertext</A>,I have learned, is the way that normal people are 
allowed to use computers.  What I mean by that is hypertext covers up all 
the messy computer commands that most people do not understand (like me 
before I took this course).  Now when someone wants to write something on 
the computer, one needs to use all those messy commands (plain text).  When 
people see
what you have written they are looking at it in HTML (hypertext markup 
language)i.e., the pretty,clean stuff that we all see on Mosaic and the 
Internet.  Now a <A HREF= 
"http://www.ziff.com/~eamonn/crash_course.html#links"> 
link</A> is 
merely how one makes those blue words that you 
click on that can send you from one document to another document. Please 
click on the highlighted markers in this article to get much more detailed 
information and directions on how to create your very own <A 
HREF="http://www.willamette.edu/html-composition/strict-html-single.html">HTML</A> 
document 
with links! <p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ2"><H2>The weather...</H2></A>
While looking for the weather in my favorite ski spot I happened to find several 
different weather reporting services.  Curious about the weather in <A HREF= 
"http://thunder.met.fsu.edu/~nws/flwx.html">Florida</A>?  At this site you may view the 
entire state of Florida and then click on hi-lited cities for a current weather 
report.  For weather all over the world all you need to do is hop onto the <A HREF= 
"http://thunder.met.fsu.edu/nws/public_html/wxhwy.html"> Weather 
Information Superhighway</A> and choose just about anywhere in the world.  Some sites 
include colorful satellite maps.  You can then see for yourself how the weather system 
is acting and possibly predict your own weather forecast. My <A HREF= 
"http://zebu.uoregon.edu/weather.html">favorite</A> so far is 
the local Oregon weather reports.  Here you can hit the second `this' by local forecast
and link into the University of Michigan's Weather Underground and receive information 
about many different cities in the U.S.  Happy weathering!   <p><A

<LI><A NAME="QQ3"><H2>Do you like to ski?</H2></A>Skiing happens to be 
one of my most favorite things to do in the whole world.  When I found 
the<A HREF="http://diamond.sierra.net:80/SkiWeb/">SKIWEB</A> I was pretty 
excited.  Now I can look up current 
weather conditions if I'm planning a trip.  I can also get current road 
conditions and lodging information.  From the Rocky Mountains to 
Europe, it's all covered right here.  One of my favorite spots to visit 
in the Web World is<A 
HREF="http://www.adfa.oz.au/aais/Maps/AUS.html">Australia</A> 
because I have not yet had a chance to visit there in the real world. 
They have a great map with satellite pictures and the works.  Just give 
it a couple of minutes to download.  

<p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ4"><H2>Learn about a special study in Cognitive 
Science..</H2></A> I have discovered that I can learn about what my 
professors are researching while they are here at U.C. Irvine.  One 
interesting study that you can discover for<A HREF="http://www.socsci.uci.edu/cogsci/projects/civs/civs.html"> yourself</A> is 
by my 
Experimental Psychology profesor, Professor D'Zmura. You can <A HREF="http://www.socsci.uci.edu/cogsci/personnel/dzmura/dzmura.html">`meet'</A>
him and all the other members of the U.C. Irvine Social Science <A HREF="http://www.socsci.uci.edu/faculty.html">faculty</A> 
and find out about the research of other professors.  His main research 
emphasis is in color and visual comprehension of color.  This has a lot 
to do with understanding colorblindness. So...if everyone is telling you 
that your clothes never match when you think they do, D'Zmura's the man for 
you. <p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ5"><H2>Information about becoming an undergraduate in 
the school of Social Sciences at U.C.I.</H2></A> Entering U.C. Irvine as a 
freshman was difficult. What made it even harder was the fact that I knew 
very little about my major.  On the web one can find important 
information that introduces the new student or just an inquisitive one 
to the department of<A HREF="http://www.socsci.uci.edu/umsocsci/umsocsci.html">Social Sciences at 
U.C.I.</A>As we have previously seen you can even meet the members of the 
faculty and communicate with them through<A 
HREF="http://www.socsci.uci.edu/faculty.html"> e-mail</A>. Pick a professor 
in an area that looks interesting and send them some mail. Professors are 
human, too, they love mail.
