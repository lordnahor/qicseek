Our private charters take place on our sportfishing boat, the Hornsby.
Reservations for one-day private charters must be made at least two weeks in
advance, and two-day trip reservations must be a month in advance.  Private
charters are held only on weekends and are for parties ranging in size from
one to eight people.  These trips can be very customized according to the
party leader.  Since they are paying by the hour, they may request a spot, or
ask for the captain's advice on the best spot for certain fish.  Charges will
be based upon length of trip, number of members in the party, and conditions
for fishing.</p>

<p>
To assure our clients of a good fishing experience, we have provided an
exclusive <b>insurance policy</b>, for information <a href="ins.html">click
