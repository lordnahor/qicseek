Note that there are separate record numberings for births, banns,
marriages, and deaths.
<BR>(Banns are the public declaration of the intent to marry.)
<UL>
<LI> a person is described in one line,
with the given name first and the surname in ALL CAPS
<LI> an "<tt>x</tt>" before a name indicates a male,
     <BR>an "<tt>o</tt>" before a name indicates a female
<LI> births and deaths are expressed as
<pre>
       Date1 Year1 #Akt1 - Date2 Year2 #Akt2
</pre>
  <UL>
  <LI> not all of these items are necessarily present
  <LI> Date1 (Date2) refers to the date of birth (death)
  <LI> Year1 (Year2) refers to the year of birth (death)
  <LI> Akt1 (Akt2) refers to the record, or Akt, number
      <BR>in the archival birth (death) records of that year
      <BR>for the city of Krakow, unless another city is cited
  <LI> if there is only one event and there is no "<tt>-</tt>" then it is a birth
  <LI> if there is only one event and there is a "<tt>-</tt>" before the event then it is a death
  <LI> in some instances, an event was recorded in a later year,
   <BR>in which case that fact will be shown in parentheses.
   <BR>For example: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
       <tt>Mar 15, 1834 (1836 #75)</tt>
   <BR>means that the birth on Mar 15, 1834
   was recorded as birth Akt 75 of the year 1836 in Krakow
  </UL>
<LI> a person's spouse is shown in the following line,
   <BR>an "<tt>m:</tt>" preceding the name indicates a wife,
   <BR>an "<tt>M:</tt>" preceding the name indicates a husband
<LI> the children of a (married) couple are shown,
   in chronological order when dates are known,
   <BR>under the lines of the (married) couple
   <B><font color=blue>with a common indentation</font></B>
<LI> a person's second spouse (presumably after death or divorce
     of the first spouse)
     <BR> is shown after the lines of
     the descendents of the first spouse
<LI> the indentations are synchronized by use of vertical lines
   that alternate using the | and ! symbols
<LI> an absence of one of the vertical lines indicates that a
   relationship (usually of the groom-bride, but sometimes of
   the child to the parents) is probable but uncertain
