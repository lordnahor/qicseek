		<p><b>Mapping Attribution in Large-Scale Distributed Astrophysics Collaborations</b>
		<br><br><img src="i/LHC.jpeg" width="420" height="250"><br />
		<p>The move toward 'big science' in a growing number of fields like astrophysics and particle physics has led to massively decentralized scientific collaborations. Perhaps the archetypal example of a massive scientific collaboration is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Massive scientific collaborations suffer from the inability to track and recognize the contributions of scientists. The LHC, for example, has just under 3000 collaborators on its initial publication, and the names of contributors are largely put in alphabetical order in such large collaborations. The traditional order-by-contribution model does not work for growing collaborations; how do we begin to address attribution in growing scientific collaborations?
		<p>I have been interviewing astrophysicists for a qualitative study to understand the social and work processes in their current collaborations. My interviews will be used to gather requirements for tools to map digital traces of scientists' contributions. The research will yield tools to visualize the level of contribution from every collaborator. Dr. Olson and I are also exploring the possibilities for novel cataloging methods for scientific contributions.
		<p><b>Adoption of Google Apps in University Settings</b>
		<br><br><img src="i/gapps.png" width="420" height="168"><br />
		<p>A growing number of universities are adopting browser-based software suites like Google Apps that allow people to collaborate on maintenance of documents. I work with Dr. Judy Olson on a longitudinal study on how students and faculty use Google Apps in university settings. I administrate and analyze surveys focused on students' use of Apps across six campuses within the University of California and University of Michigan. Our lab continues to work with partners at Google to share insights on pathways to adoption.
		<p><b>Building a Social News System for Scientific Articles</b>
		<br><br><img src="i/reddit.png" width="420" height="140"><br />
		<p>There are too many scientific articles to sort through efficiently, and it's difficult to find interesting papers without exhaustive literature review or learning about useful resources from others. Social news websites like <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">Slashdot</a>, <a href="http://www.digg.com">Digg</a>, <a href="http://www.reddit.com">reddit</a>, and others, surface interesting and timely media content from across the internet by letting users vote on the prominence of links. I am interested in adapting their design features to better surface timely and interesting scientific articles. 
		<p>My current work is devoted to building and user testing a social news aggregation tool for scientific articles, starting with the ACM Digital Library. The platform will also provide context for the reader. Using this system, scientists will also be able to rate, discuss, and critique articles.
