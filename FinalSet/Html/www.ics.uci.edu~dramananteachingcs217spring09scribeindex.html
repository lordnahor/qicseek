<h1>Scribe instructions</h1>
<hr>

<p>Scribes are required to copy down all notes presented in class. If necessary, they are expected to go back to the source material to clear up the notes. They are due <b> 1 week </b> after the corresponding lecture. Since they are worth 10% of your final grade and will be used by the whole class, please put some effort into them.</p>

<p><b>Latex</b><br>
If you are not familiar with latex, now is a great time to learn it. Here is a useful starting <a href="http://www.maths.tcd.ie/~dwilkins/LaTeXPrimer/"> page</a>.  It is de facto standard for nearly all conference and journal publications. You can get started by downloading the below files and running "pdflatex lecture.tex" on any linux machine from the instructional labs. Here is link to installing on <a href="http://www.pinteric.com/miktex.html">Windows</a> and <a href="http://guides.macrumors.com/Installing_LaTeX_on_a_Mac">Mac</a>.</p>

<p><b>Files</b><br>
<a href = "lecture.tex"> lecture.tex </a> <br>
<a href = "scribe.sty"> scribe.sty </a> <br>
</p>

<p><b>Figures</b><br>
Since we will be using pdlatex, figures must be jpegs or pdfs.  The easiest solution is to find a corresponding diagram in another source, or scan in a hand-drawn diagram. One can also use drawing programs such as xfig, visio, powerpoint 2008, etc.</p>

<p> <b> Instructions for submission </b><br>
[1] Place lecture.pdf, lecture.tex, scribe.sty, and associated figures into a single directory named <em>lectureX</em>, where X is the given lecture number. I should be able to regenreate lecture.pdf by running pdflatex from this directory. <br>
[2] Zip or tar all files from the directory into <em>lectureX.tar</em> or <em>lectureX.zip</em>.<br>
[3] If possible, place zipfile online and mail me a link (<tt>dramanan@ics.uci.edu</tt>). Else upload zipfile to the <em>SharedStudentFiles</em> directory in the EEE dropbox and mail me a notification.</p>
