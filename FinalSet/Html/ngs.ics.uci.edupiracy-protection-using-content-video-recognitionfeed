		<description><![CDATA[As Richard Stallman says, its not piracy (they are not pirates who kill and steal).. The word is &quot;unauthorized copying&quot; :)

Using his terminology, unauthorized copying,  in my opinion, can never be curbed.  Using the above technique, only a certain part of the web can be monitored for unauthorized media. Websites like rapidshare, the plethora of P2P networks share more media than one can imagine. Processing all of this can take up tonnes of processing power. 

Also,  a main reason of unauthorized copying, besides many others, are the high prices of the original goods. If the original prices are reduced, we may see a marked reduction in P2P transfers. 

A possible threat to media sharing may be imposed in the form of DRM. But this again has ways to be tackled. Personally, I do not like DRM and would prefer Vance Ikezoye&#039;s approach to curb unauthorized media sharing.]]></description>
