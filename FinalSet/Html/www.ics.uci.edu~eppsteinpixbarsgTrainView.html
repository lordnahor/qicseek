Sitges (pronounced to rhyme with "stitches" -- it's Catalan for "silo") is 
a popular beach town near<br>
Barcelona that Diana visited while I was giving my talk. She accidentally 
got onto the express train,<br>
which passed by Sitges without stopping, so she had to get off and come 
back on a different train.<br>
The added views of this detour easily made up for the slight delay.
