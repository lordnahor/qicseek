<H1>Letters of Recommendation</H1>
I will gladly write letters of recommendation for 
people I've worked with:
students (past or
present), TAs, tutors, or other colleagues.
<p>
Since I've taught large classes for many years,
I receive many recommendation requests.
A few guidelines will help me satisfy yours most effectively:

<UL>
<LI><B>Give me enough lead time.  </B>
If you do have a last-minute need for a letter,
I'll try to accommodate it, but I'd prefer to have 
at least two weeks' advance notice. Also, it will make both of us feel more secure if you drop me an Email message three days before the letter is due, just to make sure it got sent out.</LI>
<br>

<LI><B>Give me the vital statistics.  </B>
At a minimum, remind me of the details of our
association:  Which course(s) <EM>in which quarter(s)</EM>
did you take, tutor, or TA?
This helps me find your records and those of your class.
It's really important, especially during the season when
many recommendations are due, that I have this information
in writing, right along with your recommendation forms.
(Don't just tell me in person; don't just send me a message, unless all of your applications are on-line. 
Write down each course and each quarter and give it to me
at the same time you give me the form(s).
Also, please make sure your name is on every form,
transcript, and envelope.)</LI>
</br>
<LI><B>Give me details.  </B>
The more information I have, the better.
Copies of your resume or statement of purpose are helpful.
Better still would be to 
help me recall any particularly good questions
you asked in class, any conversations we had outside of class, any
particularly interesting projects you've done, any teaching evaluations you have, or any other details
that I may have forgotten&mdash;these will help flesh out your recommendation. This is important for people I haven't seen in a while,
but it's also useful if I know you well and see you often;
I still may not remember specific details of our early association.</LI>
<br><li><b>Let's talk.  </b>
Try to arrange a time to sit down with me for a brief chat,
to let me know what you've been doing and what you'd like to do.
I may even be able to give you some useful advice
for your application process and choice of schools.
</li>
</UL>


<H3>References Without Letters</H3>
I'm also glad to entertain requests to serve as an employment reference
or other reference that doesn't require that I write
a letter.  
Most of the same guidelines apply:  When you get in touch
with me to ask, give me as much information as you can.


<H3>Good luck!</H3>
