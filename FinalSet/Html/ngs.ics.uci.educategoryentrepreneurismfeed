				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Twitter became a very powerful medium and its popularity soared rapidly.  Twitter became a major News source for the latest events.  And it remains a popular site.  Many academic researchers are exploring all aspects of twitter ranging from how it is used, how information propagates on it, how can one get information, how can one detect sentiments, and so on.  Twitter data has become a good source of research papers for many budding researchers in different research fields.  On the other hand, many companies build products using Twitter data. Products ranging from early detection of trends, popularity of politicians, to sentiments of people on a particular topic have been productized.  However, there are some limitations of Twitter data for many applications.  </p>
<p>Twitter data is so broad in scope that any topics can be found in tweets, but unfortunately all topics are mixed together. If we treat the relevant information as signal, and all others as noise, twitter data has very low signal-noise-ratio (SNR).  Use of tools like hash-tags help, but do not really solve the problem.  Given this about current Twitter like social network, we believe that they all suffer serious issue of low SNR and are less effective as information sources. Therefore, we propose the concept of Focused Micro Blogs (FMB).  FMBs are on a focused topic and are targeted to a specific source.  Since the topic is fixed, the information in a FMB could be easily structured and parsed.   FMBs retain the important feature of sending brief real time information of Tweets, while overcoming their weakness of combining too many different topics in one place. This information is aggregated at a server designed for a specific task.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s consider one concrete example of FMB in a popular application for traffic â€“ the Waze.  Waze is an application on phones that takes GPS data periodically from the phone and uses this to compute the speed of the device.  This is aggregated at the server to know traffic conditions in different areas.  A user may also do a micro-blog using specific input mechanisms so that the system knows about a stalled car or a police officer at a specific location.  By using sensor data from the phone and specific micro-blog-inputs, a Waze server provides very useful information to its users.  This is an FMB in action.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two common buzz words in computing are currently big data and social computing.  As with most new technologies, both these terms mean different things to different people.  </p>
<p>Big data to some people is defined only using the size, to others it has equally important other dimensions such as the variety or heterogeneity of data, speed of generation of new data, and processing requirements.  For every new technology, initially people use it to only extend old applications.  Big data is no different.  Most initial problems are considered related to storage, indexing, search, and visualization.  Much attention is being received by these old problems that definitely become more serious problems as the size and the nature of data changes.  Soon we will see people talking about new problems that are solved by big data and will drive technology development in big data.  Nothing new here, this has happened to almost all revolutionary technologies.  And the same will keep happening in future also.  That is how technology progresses.  After initial incremental applications,  big data will help in solving problems that could not be solved until now.  And that will be the exciting period. </p>
<p>Social computing started becoming a popular area with increasing popularity of social networks, particularly Facebook and Twitter.  One of the reasons for the rapid emergence of social computing as a discipline is availability of large volumes of social data very rapidly.  Before social networks, collection of social data was an expensive and deliberate effort requiring significant amount of time.  Moreover, data-collection techniques functioned in artificial environments and did not necessary reflect a natural state.  Just a few years ago, nobody could imagine that so many people will be contributing so much personal information, opinions about issues, and information related to happenings in the world from mundane to important.  This allows collection of data that was unimaginable related to social behavior as well as issues.  The effect of social media on News is well recognized.  With the popularity of smart phones and applications, so called Apps, one can see another interesting trend.  One can collect data related to people, activities, and events that nobody could imagine.</p>
<p>From ancient times, people have been interested in designing social systems.  I believe that now is the right time to combine Big Data and Social Computing to design unique social systems and applications.  In the following, I will present my early thoughts on this topic to get better clarifications, through my articulation and then feedback from you, on this topic.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since the acquisition of Instagram earlier, the guessing game of who is next &#8216;Instagram&#8217; to be acquired has become popular.  All kinds of guesses are around.  You may also have your favorite company or area that you think is the next Instagram.</p>
<p>I find this guessing game interesting.</p>
<p>Instagram was unique and so will be the next company to be very successful &#8211; the so-called Next Instagram.  The idea that one can simply find a &#8216;similar&#8217; company in slightly different space seems naive.  Instagram was unique in its approach to use filters in such a simple, expressive, spontaneous way that people just could not resist the urge to share their photos.  This was photo sharing app, like many others, but was very easy to use, it allowed people to express themselves (note it did not express &#8212; it just gave very easy ways to express just a few things), and promoted spontaneity.  You don&#8217;t have to spend lot of time trying to be &#8216;expressive&#8217; in your communication.  The most powerful communication is usually the one that does not come in the way.  If the tools for communication take more effort than the satisfaction given by the need of modern generation for instantaneous communication, then it is likely to be rejected.  Most other sharing applications even after Instagram&#8217;s success do not have courage to accept the elegance offered by the courage to reject featuritis.  </p>
<p>The space of communication and experience sharing is huge.  Much of human activities are based on this communication.  Interestingly, even in 2012, most of the experience sharing mechanisms have not used even a fraction of experience capture and sharing ability offered by mobile phones.  Most applications do utilize photos/videos and location.  And yes visual information is dominant mode in experience sharing, but even visual information becomes order of magnitudes more experiential when enhanced using the context and other experiential data.  By effectively using multiple modes and sources of experiential data, it is possible to communicate holistic experience that may even surpass one day the experience by being there.  Many of us may find it difficult to believe, but that is already happening in some areas and will happen in many more areas and will become available commonly on regular devices.  </p>
<p>Most of the current successful companies on mobile phones have used the experiential and contextual power of these devices only partially.  Many interesting apps are emerging in this space and most address one component of the experience.  What we require is breaking the silos and creating more realistic experiences.  And that is now possible using emerging devices.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>VisR has new version available on Android phones.  The new version works effortlessly on your android mobile phones.  Even if you don&#8217;t take photos using VisR, but other cameras &#8212; including the native camera &#8212; that put photos in the gallery of the phone, VisR will organize them in events, will allow you to search them based on type of events, people, places, and dates.  You can also edit events and annotate them.  The system helps you even when you did not use it to take and organize photos explicitly.  It acts like your personal butler &#8212; always working for you.  You can also share events (all or some photos) on facebook, twitter, or using email.  VisR is for sharing Visual Events, not just photos.</p>
<p>This system is also supported by the back end where all your shared photos are collected and you can share them with any body.  Photos from all users will also be available there and you could visualize them based on multiple search criteria.  </p>
<p>And the system is currently in its very early version.  All capabilities will be refined soon and new powerful introduced.  So if you have an android, download it from marketplace and enjoy.   For iPhone users, please wait for a bit more.</p>
<p>(Disclaimer:  I am a co-founder of mChron, whis is behind VisR.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While playing with my Android, and later with iPhone, I realized how much improvement has taken place in the camera technology in these devices â€“ also in other mobile phones.  One gets a fairly decent camera in a phone, and there is enough memory to store thousands of photos.  Many cameras also offer special scene modes and even special effects to be applied to a photo if so desired.  These cameras definitely encourage people to take lots of photos.  And one can easily notice that â€“ even in emerging countries.</p>
<p>It is surprising, however, that photo browsing approach on an android or even iPhone  still remains very primitive.  All photos captured on an android  go to the â€˜galleryâ€™.  And this gallery allows you to browse through the photos either in thumbnail mode.  Granted that flicking through photos is fun.  And that many systems give a facility to create a slideshow.  These things are not bad to go through and find photos that you may want to retrieve or find use or share them, if the number of photos is not too large.  As the number of photos goes to hundreds and then to thousands, these playful methods starts becoming punishment.  It is amazing how the volume of data changes how we interact with it.  When we took just a few photos, it was OK to sequentially browse them.  But with the culture that has emerged with the new technology, this approach is as if we have to still deal with our music in the days of sequential reel-to-reel tapes.  We were forces to go through our music sequentially.  We were used to listening to all our music that way â€“ it was too much work to find songs that we wanted to listen to.  There was no concept of playlists.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, our photo galleries on our mobile phones as well as elsewhere have not much evolved from the days of traditional Kodak Moments.  It will be great if we could modernize photo galleries in our mobile phones so we can browse them using techniques of this decade rather than using those from several decades ago.</p>
