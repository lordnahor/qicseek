<p>
Starting in 2004 I have lead the development of a new offering of the ICS Masters degree in  <br>
Embedded Systems.  The goal of this effort was two-fold: to make access to our program easier for<br>
European and international students and to create a Masters degree program for American students  <br>
that will expose them to foreign cultures and languages. <br>
</p>
<p>
After only 2 years of effort the program has been approved by the University of California in 2006. The <br>
program is now being offered part time in Naples, Italy and part time in the US at UC Irvine. It is <br>
offered in collaboration with the Institute of Cybernetics of the Italian National Research Council at<br>
their location in Nalpes.<br>
</p>
<p>
The program can be completed in 5 quarters, two summer quarters at UCI and 3 quarters in Naples.  The courses<br>
and the teaching faculty are exactly the same as in the standard UC Irvine offering of the program and offer <br>
an excellent general Computer Science degree with a particular emphasis on parallel and embedded systems.<br>
Upon completion of the program the students can choose to undergo practical training at the many high technology<br>
companies in California or can choose to pursue a PhD program at UCI or other California or US universities. <br>
