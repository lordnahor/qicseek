Three neat Web finds:
<ol>
<li><A HREF="http://hanksville.phast.umass.edu/misc/NAresources.html">Native 
American Resources on the Internet</A> - This is interesting, because I 
realize that my community has the capability to access current technology. 

<li><A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~aisi/">American Indian Summer Institute 
Home Page</A> - I enjoyed viewing this link, because I have worked for 
this program for the last three summers as a Resident Assistant.

<li><A HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">U.S. White House Welcome</A> - 
This is just another means of seeing what's going on at the White House, 
besides radio and television.

<LI><A NAME="QQ1"><B>What does the word 'wacipi' mean in Sioux?</B></A><br>
In Sioux <A 
HREF="http://www.state.sd.us/state/executive/tourism/sioux/powwows.htm"> 
wacipi</A> literally means 'dance' and can be defined 
as a powwow, a cultural gathering where American Indians can dance, 
socialize, and just have a good time.  Usually a traditional wacipi will 
occur during the summer months and can last about three days, beginning 
at noon and continuing on till the wee hours of the morning.  There are 
various styles of dance for men and women, each with their own origin 
myths.  The men may dance Traditonal, Grass Dance, or Fancy 
War, whereas the women dance Traditional, Fancy Shawl, or Jingle Dress.  
For each style, the regalia clearly defines the differences.  However; 
one thing that is common to the dancers outfit is the footgear, also
known as moccasins which can be adorned with <A

quillwork</A> or beadwork.

<LI><A NAME="QQ2"><B>What type of syntax does the Mosaic browser read?

</B></A><br>
This question was originally, for the Jingle Dress dance style, what 
tribe did it originate from?  The answer regarding syntax that the Mosaic 
browser can read is <A 
HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/MarkUp.html#4"> HTML</A> 
(Hypertext Markup Language).  This language utilizes documents which 
contain hypertext links, the relationship between two documents, which 
allows a viewer the ability to jump from page to page by using the 'mouse' 
to point and click to the desired document. The
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Tags.html">elements of 
HTML</A> are very important, they are what comprise an appropriate 
document.  There are many things which should be included in an HTML 
document; however the most important are the 'links' and what is included 
in the text portion.

<LI><A NAME="QQ3"><B>What tribe did the U.S. Government first promise physician
services as partial payment for rights & property ceded?</B></A><br> 
The U.S. Government's first <A 
HREF="http://www.tucson.ihs.gov/Docs/GenFolder/IHSFacts.html">Federal-Tribal 
relationship</A> that promised physician services was with the Winnebago 
tribe in 1832. Today this agreement is referred to as 
the <A HREF="http://www.tucson.ihs.gov/Docs/GenFolder/IHSProfile.html"> 
Indian Health Service (IHS)</A>.  The IHS was established to meet the health
needs of American Indian and Alaska Native people on and off the 
reservations.  The services provided include hospitals, emergency rooms, 
and health management.  Even though this modern-day medical service is 
provided as a result from past treaties and agreements, the American Indian 
people are not always openly accepting towards a 'strange' medicine.  For 
hundreds of years, they have relied upon traditional means of curing - 
their spirituality (healing the whole, rather than the part) and turning to 
Mother Earth for roots and herbs.

<LI><A NAME="QQ4"><B>Where would one go to learn about Labanotation?</B></A><br>
Interestingly enough one can learn about Labanotation here 
at <A HREF="http://www.cwis.uci.edu/information.html"> UCI</A>.  There are 
currently two professors within the 
<A HREF="gopher://uniedit.cwis.uci.edu:7026/00/new.cat/fa/dance">Dance 
Department</A> who are certified Labanotators: the Chair of the Dance 
Department - Professor James Penrod, and Mary Corey.  Labanotation is the 
way in which one records dance movement and steps through a system of 
symbols that represent body parts, direction (three-dimensionally) and 
timing (phrasing and musicality).  All the elements involved with a 
dancer and her movements. This method of notation allows choreographers 
to preserve their 'works' in exact duplication, rather than relying on 
memory or handwritten notes (usually the interpretation gets lost with 
words and is not always comprehensible by others reading the notes).   It's 
comparable to learning a foreign language.

<LI><A NAME="QQ5"><B>What can the World Wide Web offer?
</B></A><br>
It has become a cold-hard fact that computers are an integral part of 
today's society.  The World Wide Web was proposed 
by <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/People/Berners-Lee-Bio.html"> 
Tim Berners-Lee</A> of 
the <A HREF="http://www.cern.ch/">CERN</A> laboratory in Geneva, 
Switzerland to be a system which could 
easily be accessed universally by anyone with Internet connections.  By 
means of the Web, one has connections to various forms of multimedia - 
sound, music, video, games and CD-ROM.  Since the Web was set up to be as 
simple as possible, a person can locate information such as universities 
in the United States, find out the weather in a certain city or even read 
cartoons.  The search is endless and 'surfing' the Web allows people in 
various fields a chance to locate their interests and needs.  FYI:  this 
question was formerly - what university is ranked number one for their 
Dance Department?
