	<h3>COAST</h3> (with Michael Gorlick, Alegria Baquero, Alberto Pareja-Lecaros, Christoph Dorn, Richard N. Taylor)
	<p><b>COmputAtional State Transfer</b> (COAST) (following a previous project, <a href="http://www.erenkrantz.com/CREST/">CREST</a>) is an architectural style for the construction of adaptive, decentralized Internet service ecosystems.
	In COAST, customized, tailored microservices are implemented as mobile computations and deployed across organizational bounds to execute in the context of domain- and organization-specific execution sites.
	Those services collaborate with other services by exposing fine-grained, differentiated interfaces to computations exchanged amongst them.</p>
	<p>Our implementation of COAST comprises <b>Motile</b>, an architectural style-specific functional mobile code language designed to enforce the security and functional constraints of COAST, and the supporting infrastructure <b>Island</b>.
	Security is addressed via the application of <i>capability security</i> to limit both the communicative and computational capability allocated to deployed services.
	The rights to communicate with COAST services are conferred by <i>Capability URLs</i>, unforgeable cryptographic structures that encompass numerous restrictions on communication and provide a basis for higher level constructs such as transactions and contracts between mutually suspicious parties.
	The rights afforded to any Motile mobile code are determined by <i>islands</i> whose owners use the <b>Island</b> infrastructure and tools to segregate, allocate and monitor the functions and assets granted to visiting Motile code.
