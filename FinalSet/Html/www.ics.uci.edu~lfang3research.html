								<div class="sub_brief">Brief Description:</div>
								Performance problems in a large-scale application are extremely
								difficult to find. Traditional performance test oracles such as
								time/memory checks are coarse-grained and subjective; as a result,
								performance bugs often escape to production runs, hurting
								software reliability and user experience. In this project, we focus on  
								a class of performance problems whose symptoms can be described by logical
								statements over a history of heap updates. We propose
								a general technique that can amplify the effects of this kind of performance bugs
								as well as provide precise
								diagnostic information. Amplification serves as an automated
								test oracle because it increases memory consumption significantly
								for tests that trigger performance problems while having a very
								small impact on bug-free runs. As a result, developers can easily
								divide tests into successful and failing runs, and focus their effort
								on failing tests. Using the diagnostic precise information (such as reference paths)
								which is provided by our tool, developers can easily identify the root causes
								of performance problems.

								<br /> Superviser: Dr. Lijie Wang,
								Software Engineering Institute, Peking University <br />
								<div class="sub_brief">Brief Description:</div>
								APIExample is an effective web search based usage example
								recommendation system for java APIs (Here we use API to
								represent java classes). It automatically identifies and
								extracts usage examples (containing both code snippet and
								readable descriptive texts) from various web pages on the
								Internet. Based on in-depth analysis on the collected examples,
								APIExample provides API's usage related information in multiple
								aspects to programmers. With the help of APIExample, a
								programmer can capture a full view on the usage of target API
								and thus learn about the API efficiently. The tool provides two
								kinds of user interaction style: a web search portal and an
								Eclipse plug-in. <br />

								<div class="sub_brief">Brief Description:</div>
								Existing web service tags are annotated manually, and manual
								tagging is time-consuming and expensive. The approach exploits
								WSDL documents and additional information, extracts semantic and
								syntactic information, and annotates web services automatically.
								These tags can support web service understanding, categorizing
								and discovering, which are important tasks in a service-oriented
								software system.

								<div class="sub_brief">Brief Description:</div>
								With more and more Web services available on the Internet, many
								approaches have been proposed to help users discover and select
								desired services. However, existing approaches heavily rely on
								the information in UDDI repositories or WSDL files, which is
								quite limited in fact. The limitation of information weakens the
								effectiveness of existing approaches. A novel Web services
								search engine named CoWS (Comprehensive Web services Search
								engine) is presented. CoWS enriches Web services information
								using the information captured from the Internet to provide
								quality-aware Web services search. The information captured can
								be classified into two groups: functional descriptions and
								subjective feedbacks. The functional descriptions are used to
								enrich descriptions of Web services, and the subjective
								feedbacks are used to calculate Web servicesâ€™ reputation.
								<ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
