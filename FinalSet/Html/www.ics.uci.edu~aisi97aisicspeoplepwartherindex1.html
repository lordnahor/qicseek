<P>Phisherman Phil's Charter Fishing is an organization which allows a
quality fishing experience for anyone, rich or poor. We have fishing trips
to several locations in the

There are either <a href="schedule.html">public
trips</A>, scheduled for weekdays, or
<a href="private.html">private charters</a> which occur on weekends.</P>

and one full-size party boat. Rod rentals are available for all trips.</P>
