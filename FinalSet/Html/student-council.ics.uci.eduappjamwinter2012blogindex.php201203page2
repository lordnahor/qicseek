<p>App Update:<br />
Today we made a lot of progress in getting our app&#8217;s components to work together. In the beginning of the week when we threw around ideas and planned out our app, we all had our own goals and visions of what we would eventually make. As of tonight, the primary functionality of our app is finished, some of which we did not even anticipate having time to implement. While there are still a few aspects of our app which we are tweaking and/or trying to implement, here is what we have done so far:</p>
<p>Implemented:<br />
&#8211;Google Maps<br />
&#8211;Text to speech<br />
&#8211;Search Functionality<br />
&#8211;User Uploads<br />
&#8211;Personal Profiles</p>
<p>Challenges:<br />
Now that we are satisfied with our app, our main focus is on the presentation. We still lots to do and we are working hard to not slow down and continue to look for ways to improve our app and find creative ways we can present on Tuesday. One of the biggest challenges we faced this week were implementing and GUI without the use of a 3rd party API. However, after much hard work and deliberation over design styles, we are all happy with our result. Hopefully all goes well tomorrow.</p>

<p>Current Project Status:</p>
<p>Our app is functionally complete! We are at the point of fine-tuning all components to make sure the final product is as smooth and efficient as possible.</p>
<p>Progress Today:</p>
<p>Our progress today somewhat blended with our progress yesterday. Our group worked tirelessly through the night and into the morning. We spent all of Sunday as a group to put the final touches on the apps highest priority requirements. Through our hard work, superb communication, and extensive dedication, we have created a product that is very close to the app we design in the first couple days of AppJam.</p>
<p>Challenges:</p>
<p>Aside from usual Git merge issues, today was arguably our most productive day. Our biggest challenges came with fighting exhaustion and hunger from the long work hours of the previous day and the morning.</p>

<p><strong>Current Status of the Project<br />
</strong>Our app is currently at 80% complete. We got a bulk of the work done today.   We met up today at 1pm today and have stayed together until midnight.  We&#8217;re not having as many challenges as we expected, so today&#8217;s workflow was extremely efficient.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Today:</strong><br />
<em>Android (Client Side ):</em></p>
<p><em></em>The majority of the app&#8217;s functionality was implemented. Aesthetics were tremendously updated. Added almost all of the necessary connections with the database.</p>
<p><em>Server/Database:<br />
</em>We have completed our database.</p>
<p><em>Design/UI:</em><br />
We got our design at 100%.   We finished all of our icons and artwork.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<p>Limitations with the database required us to change how we handled several aspects of the app.  Issues with figuring out how do certain things with the android code were frustrating, but we figured them out after plenty of time spent debugging.</p>

<p><strong>Current Status of the Project<br />
</strong>All of the major features that we proposed in our design  have been implemented. Our app is  now being tested and is looking great. However, this does not mean that implementation and development has stopped, as bug fixes need to be made. While half of the team test to assure quality, the other half of the team has started on our presentation materials (i.e. the powerpoint presentation, poster, and report).<strong><strong></strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Progress Today:</strong><br />
<em>Android (Client Side ):</em><br />
The client team implemented the very last of the features on our functional specifications list today, the major one being the history module of the app. The app now dynamically creates a list of the 10 most recent user feedback submitted to the logged in user. This feature was second to only the chat feature  in difficulty so we were glad to have accomplished this. We uncovered a few bugs today that still need to be fixed but they are minor. Once these bug fixes are complete, we are then going to focus all our attention on polishing up both the app and our presentation.</p>
<p><em>Server/Database:</em>Development of the server and database infrastructure is complete and tested.</p>
<p><em>Design/UI:</em>The UI team fixed a major issue with the splash screen size. The problem was it was not scaling for different size screens correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:<br />
</strong>Finishing up the last 10% of the application turned out to be more difficult than we anticipated. Pulling all of our work together and integrating it into a working system was quite a challenge indeed. We were lucky though that we ran into few bugs during testing. It definitely helped that we put in the time to do planning and design of the system architecture before diving into the implementation.</p>

<p><strong>Current Status:</strong><br />
We currently have a working application locally. It creates objects and allows text, and the objects connect to one another as desired for the application. The GUI is completely done and it is working well with the touch interface and tapping. We have figured out the way to do the Client-Server and pushing notifications using XMPP and PHP.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Today:<br />
</strong>We spent hours and hours today spending time on figuring out the XMPP and PHP coding in order to send notification to the clients once a map was updated. We needed to implement a method that would send a new map to all involved clients and not just all the clients that are registered with the map. This proved to be difficult as well as we have a SQL server that is storing all the data in terms of ID, Title, and JSON Information. This Data all needed to be received and sent and the code for this written in PHP. We worked on this for greater part of the day as well as the Android based code.<strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>Challenges:<br />
</strong>We have completed the greater part of the project and are prepared for the due date tomorrow. We are half way through the document and have created a great powerpoint document. The application itself needs some PHP and Android coding to interact with the client-server but this is minimal. We need to fix some minor bugs and work on efficiency tomorrow.</p>

<p>Today was a great day for our application. We finally integrated all of our individual parts into one app. Of course this took a long time and it is still not complete but seeing the app come together is a pretty awesome feeling. The user interface is mostly complete we just need a few small details. The main function of the app is also near complete. We have been testing our app on our phones non-stop for the past three days.</p>
<p>We are all very tired since we have been working on this app from the minute we wake up until we go to sleep (I even had a dream about it). We have run into many issues with our app. One such issue was with customizing a list in the user interface. This issue persisted for the past day and a half. When this issue was finally fixed we were all very happy because now we could continue with other parts of the application. The database seems to be working correctly so far as well as the calculations that our app performs.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we are finishing up the app and adding some finishing touches. We are going to meet up tomorrow to discuss the presentation of our application as well as anything that needs to be fixed or changed. We are all so excited to complete this application after a week of working hard, not only for the app but for classes as well.</p>

<p><strong>Current Status:</strong><br />
All major features have been implemented. The app has been tested on the android and works. There are still some bugs that need to be fixed, and we need to work on our presentation.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Today:</strong><br />
Our team was unable to meet up today, so it was an individual work day. Most of our work today was testing the app to find bugs, fixing bugs, and adding data to the database. We also tested the app on the android again and were able to get it working the same as in the emulator.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong><br />
There are still some bugs we need to fix before the deadline. There was also some difficulty getting the app to work on the android due to the google maps api and using the right keystore. However, we were able to get it working on a phone and have a better idea of how much work remains.</p>

<h2><a href="http://student-council.ics.uci.edu/appjam/winter2012/blog/index.php/day-7-progress/" rel="bookmark">Day 7 : Progress</a></h2>
<span class="submitted">March 4, 2012 &#8212; Team1 </span>

<div class="content">
<p>Before I get into the progress we had today, I wanted to mention that it was weird for me to write Day 7 : Progress when we had only 7 days to finish this. But of course I quickly realized that Day 1 was actually last monday. I now regret not stating that last monday was Day 0.</p>
<p>Today was amazing.</p>
<p>We begun at 10:00 AM and had worked on each of the small components that we had stubbed in in the previous days. After having lunch at Wendy&#8217;s ( which is the only one that was open today near the courtyard study lounge, where we worked ), we started adding functionality to the existing platform. Eventually, we took a break at 4 PM to rest from coding. At 8 PM, we meet up again and got the coolest part of the whole thing working. Our mobile app now updates asynchronously, requesting streaming data from the web server. We had some interesting issues because we had two databases (mobile, and web), and they had slightly different schemas between each other, but in the end everything worked out beautifully.</p>
<p>Our goal for tomorrow is simply to polish the UI and add in icons, and prepare for the presentation. We may add in another view now that we have all the information we need. We also need to change a little bit of code to fit to the newer version of the database.</p>
<p>The challenges we faced were mainly with storing information on the mobile end. It turned out that if we stored all the data in memory, in a conventional list data type, we would exit the application due to memory constraints. Instead we switched to a SQLite database in order to perform quick queries and keep track of things. Since we had to change our approach, some of the older code has a few problems. This will be fixed soon though.</p>
<p>All in all, I am amazed at how well our group is collaborating to get things solved. It&#8217;s a great feeling indeed.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge today was splitting our existing user interface into multiple activities instead of one, so that we could utilize both tabs and list views. We could not have our whole team present, but we continued to work on finalizing the app. We also had some difficulty with the database.</p>
