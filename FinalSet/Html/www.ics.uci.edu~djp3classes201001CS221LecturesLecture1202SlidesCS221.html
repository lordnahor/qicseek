    <meta name="description" content="Link Analysis Introduction to Information Retrieval CS 221 Donald J. Patterson Content adapted from Hinrich Schütze http://www.informationretrieval.org  Outline Link Analysis The web as a directed graph  Assumption 1: A hyperlink between pages denotes author perceived relevance (quality signal) Assumption 2: The anchor of the hyperlink describes the target page (textural context) The web as a directed graph Link Analysis  Assumption 1: A hyperlink between pages denotes author perceived relevance (quality signal) Assumption 2: The anchor of the hyperlink describes the target page (textural context)   Where might these assumptions not hold? The web as a directed graph Link Analysis  Anchor Text WWW Worm -McBryan94 For IBM how do you distinguish between IBM’s home page (mostly graphics) IBM’s copyright page (high TF for “ibm) Rival spam page (high TF for “ibm”) ? A million pieces of anchor text with “ibm” send a strong signal The web as a directed graph Link Analysis  When indexing a document D include anchor text from links pointing to D Indexing anchor text also Link Analysis  Anchor text is often a better description of a page’s content than the page itself. Can be weighted more highly than the text If enough anchor text is available Same technique as zone weighting create a “zone” for anchor text Indexing anchor text can have unexpected side effects Google bombs, miserable failure nigritude ultramarine follow-on Indexing anchor text	 Link Analysis  Other applications Weighting links in the graph Generating page descriptions from anchor text Anchor text Link Analysis  Citation analysis: Analysis of citations in the scientific literature Example citation: “Miller (2001) has shown that physical activity alters the metabolism of estrogens” PageRank Link Analysis  Link Analysis/PageRank has its origins in bibliometrics “Measurement of influence among publications based on citations” Just as citing a paper confers authority upon it, linking to a page confers authority to it. The web as a directed graph Link Analysis  Two ways of measuring similarity of scientific articles: Cocitation similarity: The two articles are cited by the same articles Bibliographic coupling similarity: The two articles site the same articles Bibliometrics Link Analysis  Co-citation similarity Link Analysis  Bibliographic coupling similarity Link Analysis  Citation frequency can be used to measure impact Each article gets one vote Not a very accurate measure Better measure: weighted citation frequency/ citation rank An article’s vote is weighted according to its citation impact. Sounds circular, but can be formalized in a well-defined way This is basically PageRank Invented for citation analysis in the 1960’s by Pinsker and Narin Bibliometrics Link Analysis  A citation in scientific literature is like a link on the web Key Observation Link Analysis  A full search engine ranks based on many different scores Cosine similarity Term proximity Zone scoring Contextual relevance (implicit queries) Link analysis Link Analysis  Retrieve all pages meeting the query First generation:  Then order them by their link popularity citation frequency Easy to spam.  Why? Second generation: Order them by their weighted link popularity PageRank Link based query ranking Link Analysis  Every webpage gets a score between 0 and 1 it’s PageRank The random walk Start at a random page Follow an out edge with equal probability In the long run each page has a long-term visit rate. PageRank Link Analysis  PageRank is a page’s long-term steady state visit rate based on a random walk model. PageRank Link Analysis  The web is full of dead-ends A random walk can get stuck in dead-ends Makes no sense to talk about long-term visit rates Visit Rate not quite enough Link Analysis  At a dead end, jump to a random web page at any non-dead end, with probability 10% jump to a random web page anyway the other 90% choose a random out link “10%” is a tunable parameter Teleporting Link Analysis  Now we cannot get stuck locally There is a long-term visit rate at which any page is visited. How do we compute the visit rate? How do we compute PageRank? (By the way this is a Markov Chain) Teleporting Link Analysis  A Markov Chain is a mathematical “game” It consists of n states  corresponds to web pages And a transition probability matrix corresponds to links it is like an adjacency matrix Markov Chains Link Analysis  At any moment in the game we are in one of the states In the next step we move to a new state We use the transition matrix to decide which state to move into. If you are in state “i” then the probability of moving into state “j” is P(i -&gt; j) Markov Chains Link Analysis  Markov Chains are described by two parameters: A list of n states An (n  by n) transition probability table It’s like a graph, except that links aren’t boolean, they are real numbers. A link doesn’t just exist or not exist It exists with a probability also Markov Chains Link Analysis  Compute the parameters of the Markov Chain for this graphical model Exercise Link Analysis  Example: 8 states (web pages or whatever) 8 by 8 transition prob. matrix Markov Chains Link Analysis  Example: 8 states 8 by 8 transition prob. matrix Handle Dead-Ends also Markov Chains Link Analysis  Example: 8 states 8 by 8 transition prob. matrix Handle Dead-Ends also Handle teleports Markov Chains Link Analysis  You may be in one state at a time Every tick you move one step chosen randomly from the transition probability matrix Markov Chain : The Game Link Analysis  It doesn’t matter where you came from. All information that you need to take the next step comes from your current state and the transition probability matrix History is irrelevant given your current state The Markov Property Link Analysis  PageRank is the long term visit rate of a random walk on the graph.
