<h3>
Student Use</h3>
Students only need to be given the following two files:
<ul>
<li>
controller.o: This is the object file that students need to link with their
application program</li>

<li>
interface.h: This is a header file that the student program must include
(#include "interface.h")</li>
</ul>
For example, under Unix the call "gcc -g controller.o student.c" produces
the executable file a.out, which runs the student program; this program
then may invoke any of the functions provided by the disk controller. (Note:
the header file and the controller module can also be used with applications
written in C++).
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Instructor Use</h3>
The emulation software consists of the following three files:
<ul>
<li>
controller.c: This contains the source code for all functions. It is compiled
into an object module (e.g. controller.o), which uses the following two
header files</li>

<li>
interface.h: This defines the interface to the controller (functions, parameter
constants, error constants)</li>

<li>
internal.h: This defines various internal functions and constants of the
emulator.</li>
</ul>
Both header functions are included by the controller.c program and must
be available when compiling controller.c into the corresponding object
module controller.o.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Modifying the Emulator</h3>
There are two features of the emulator that may be modified before producing
the object module for students: (1) the probabilities of transient errors;
(2) the emulated busy-wait times.
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
Modifying Transient Error Probabilities</h4>
Each of the three disk operations, SEEK, READ, and WRITE, may experience
a transient error. These are generated probabilistically using error rates
specified by the following three constants (in internal.h):
<pre><i>#define SEEK_ERROR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30
#define READ_ERROR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30
#define WRITE_ERROR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30</i></pre>
Each constant may range from 0 to 100, where 0 means that no transient
errors will occur and 100 means that every SEEK/READ/WRITE operation always
produces a transient error. With the above code fragment, 30% of all operations,
on average, would result in a transient error.
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
Modifying Busy-wait Times</h4>
Whenever a new opcode is written into the OP register and the controller
is not busy, it becomes busy for a certain period of time. The emulator
does not cause an actual time delay. Instead, it mimics the behavior by
requiring that the BUSY register must be polled (read using the read_reg()
function) a certain number of times. The number of polls required for a
given operation is generated probabilistically and can be controlled by
setting the following constants (in internal.h):
<pre><i>#define SEEK_POLL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 100 /* minimum value */
#define READ_POLL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 100 /* minimum value */
#define WRITE_POLL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 100 /* minimum value */
#define REPORT_POLL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10 /* minimum value */
#define ILL_OP_POLL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10 /* minimum value */
#define POLL_VARY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 50 /* percentage polling varies */</i></pre>
The first three constants give the minimum number of polls for each type
of operation. The actual number of polls is calculated by adding a random
number to the minimum value. The random number of generated using POLL_VARY,
which gives a range of variability between 0% and 100% of the minimum value.
For the above code fragment, POLL_VARY is 50% of the minimum value. So,
for the SEEK, READ, or WRITE operation, the number of times the BUSY register
must be polled will be a random number from 100 to 150.
