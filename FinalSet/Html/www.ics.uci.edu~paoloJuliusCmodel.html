<HR> 
  <li><h3 ALIGN=LEFT>A Model for Recursive Algorithm - <b>Type-DAG</b> </h3>
  
  <P> Consider matrix multiply, for example <i>C+=AB</i>. Consider the
  simplest recursive algorithm you can think of, where the matrixes
  are logically composed of four quadrants: 
  <pre>
      |C0  C1 |     |A0  A1 |     |B0  B1 |  
  C = |C2  C3 | A = |A2  A3 | B = |B2  B3 | 
  </pre> 
  We may write the algorithms as follows:
  <pre>
  C += AB  /* &lt; m,n,p &gt; */ : 
    if (m<=1 or n<=1 or p<=1) 
       c += a*b; 
    else {    
      C0 += A0*B0; /* &lt; m/2+m%2,n/2+n%2,p/2+p%2 &gt; */
      C0 += A1*B2;
      C1 += A0*B1;
      C1 += A1*B3;
      C2 += A2*B0;
      C2 += A3*B2;
      C3 += A2*B1;
      C3 += A3*B3; /* &lt; m/2,n/2,p/2 &gt;*/
   } 
  </pre>

  We indicate the size of the problem using
  the notation <i>&lt;m,n,p&gt;</i> where <i>m</i> is the number of
  rows of matrix <i>A</i>, <i>n</i> is the number of rows of <i>B</i>
  and <i>p</i> is the number of columns of <i>B</i>.
  </P>
 
  <P>
  We may wonder how many different problems we need to divide or to
  solve for a matrix multiply of size <i>&lt;17,17,17&gt;</i>. Or
  stated differently, we may wonder whether or not there are function
  calls that solve the same problem but on different data. We know
  that there are no more than <i>2*17^3</i> problems, but in practice
  there are only 34 different problems!
  </P>

  <P> By showing the unfolding of the recursion calls, and presenting
  only one node per unique problem, it should be clear why there are
  only 34 different problems (for a problem <i>&lt;n,n,n&gt;</i>, we
  have proven that there are <i>O(8log n)</i> different
  problems).

  <center> <img SRC="DAG.jpg"></center>
  </P>

  <P> For square matrices of size <i>n x n</i>, the data structure can
  be built in <i>O(8logn)</i> steps.  This is the <b>Type-DAG</b> of
  the computation.
  </P>
<HR> 

<li><h3>Type-DAG</h3>


<P> A <b>call graph</b> is a static description of the relation among
function calls in an application. Using the call graph, we can
determine whether or not we may reach from a function <i>f()</i> a
function <i>g()</i> at run time. If there is a path from <i>f()</i> to
<i>g()</i>, the execution of the application may reach <i>g()</i> if,
at any time, it reaches <i>f()</i>. (If there is no path, the
execution that reaches <i>f()</i> it will not reach <i>g()</i>.) The
call graph is used for inter-procedural - data dependency -
analysis. It is an extremely powerful abstraction.
</P>

<P> <b>Type-DAG</b> is a data structure that captures the information
of the unfolding of the call graph - which is the information about
function calls available at run-time.  The
<b>Type-DAG</b> represents the control flow of an application using a
<b>Direct Acyclic Graph</b> (DAG). Each node on the DAG represents a
family of function calls having a particular type. </P>

<P> In fact, the <b>Type-DAG</b> is the result of a hybrid
approach. Our approach requires a - very - partial execution of the
application, like a profiler, but it is based on a static analysis
reducing to a minimum the run-time information required.</P>
