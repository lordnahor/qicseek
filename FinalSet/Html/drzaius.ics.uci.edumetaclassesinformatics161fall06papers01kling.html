<font color="#000066">
</font><p><font color="#000066">A serviceable working conception of
"social informatics" is that it identifies a body of research that
examines the social aspects of computerization. A more formal
definition is "the interdisciplinary study of the design, uses and
consequences of information technologies that takes into account their
interaction with institutional and cultural contexts." </font></p><font color="#000066"> 

</font><p><font color="#000066">It is a field that is defined by its
topic (and fundamental questions about it) rather than by a family of
methods, much like urban studies or gerontology. Social informatics has
been a subject of systematic analytical and critical research for the
last 25 years. This body of research has developed theories and
findings that are pertinent to understanding the design, development,
and operation of usable information systems, including intranets,
electronic forums, digital libraries and electronic journals.</font></p><font color="#000066">  

</font><p><font color="#000066">Unfortunately, social informatics
studies are scattered in the journals of several different fields,
including computer science, information systems, information science
and some social sciences. Each of these fields uses somewhat different
nomenclature. This diversity of communication outlets and specialized
terminologies makes it hard for many non-specialists (and even
specialists) to locate important studies. It was one impetus for
coining a new term -- social informatics -- to help make these ideas
accessible to non-specialists, as well as to strengthen communication
among specialists, and to strengthen the dialogs between communities of
designers and social analysts. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000066">This article discusses some key ideas from
social informatics research and ends with a brief discussion of the
character of the field today. Readers who wish to understand social
informatics by learning about its origins and influences may wish to
start in that later section and then return to the beginning for a more
substantive focus. This article serves as a brief introduction to
social informatics for information technology professionals and
researchers, and includes numerous references to help interested
readers readily locate more comprehensive resources.</font></p>

<p></p><h3>2.0 Punditry About Information Technologies and Social Change</h3><p></p>

<p>There are alternatives to systematic research about information technologies and social change.  <i>Wired Magazine&#8217;s</i>
articles often illustrate one popular alternative -- vivid punditry. In
the January 1998 issue, journalist George Gilder wrote about the way
that computing power has increased a hundred millionfold since the
1950s. Computer scientist Danny Hillis wrote about the ways that
computerization is leading to a transformation of a new civilization in
a few paragraphs and with high spirits. This kind of opinionated
journalism is very readable. <i>Wired</i> is colorful, both in its
prose as well as its typography, and it lends itself to new sound
bites. Unfortunately, it doesn&#8217;t lead to the kind of deep understanding
which many information technology professionals need. </p><p><i>Wired</i> exemplifies the magazines that offer energetic
prose, but information technology pundits, such as Esther Dyson,
communicate in many other forums as well, such as their own books and
conference talks. Pundits play interesting social roles. The best
pundits are entertaining, provocative and timely. If an issue arises
this week, they can rapidly formulate an articulate opinion, and
perhaps even a sound bite. In simplifying, they often oversimplify and
polarize issues. Unfortunately, the typical pundit relies upon
anecdotes and bold assertions, rather than using them as entry points
for analysis. Pundits usually rely upon their own experience as a basis
for expertise and don&#8217;t encourage serious and systematic research into
information technology and social life (see <a href="#Nimmo92">Nimmo and Combs</a>, 1992).

</p><p>Professionals are sometimes involved in very prosaic work in
designing information systems, selecting and configuring equipment and
developing policies and practices about the use of the resulting
systems (i.e., which data to collect and archive, how to identify
authorized users, how to organize training and consulting). The details
of this development work differs substantially for systems as varied as
claims management for an insurance company, a litigation support system
for a law firm, and a public-access on-line library of self-help
medical bulletins supported by a public health agency. However, social
informatics researchers have developed some fundamental ideas that can
help improve professional practice and that pertain to a diverse array
of information systems.
</p><p>The design and configuration of information systems that work
well for people and help support their work, rather than make it more
complicated, is a subtle craft. Good application design ideas are
neither obvious nor effective when they are based on technological
considerations alone. Their formulation requires understanding how
people work and what kind of organizational practices obtain. However,
many managers and professionals often advance simple criteria to help
guide computerization strategies, such as:
</p><ol> 
<li> use more advanced technology (whether it is faster or easier to use);</li> 
<li> use "better technologies," (though there are different criteria
for "better" such as less expensive or compatible with other
equipment); or</li> 
<li>organize systems so that they are more efficient.</li>  
</ol>

<p>There are other guidelines, such as replacing repetitive human
activity with computer systems or devising computer systems to leverage
an organization&#8217;s value chain. These kinds of context-free guidelines
have not been good enough to help information technology professionals
design or implement effective systems. </p><p>Their limitations will be illustrated by the examples that I
develop in the following sections. Before I launch into a discussion of
some interesting ideas from social informatics research, I will discuss
one important phenomenon that helps sets the stage for the importance
of social informatics for information technology professionals -- "the
productivity paradox."
</p><p></p><h3>3.0  The Productivity Paradox</h3><p></p>

<p>Between 1960 and 1980, computer use and productivity gains were
linked together -- in the writings of economists, in the advertisements
for new computer systems, and even in the expectations of many working
people who feared that widespread computerization could lead to a
society with massive unemployment. As the costs of acquiring computers
rapidly declined, many North American organizations, public and
private, increased their investments in computerized systems. In the
late 1980s, U.S. firms were spending approximately half of their
capital funds on computers and telecommunications. Economists noticed
that national statistics for labor productivity were not steadily
increasing, and some managers noticed that large investments in PCs did
not seem to translate into major productivity boosts. </p><p>Since the late 1980s, the U.S. business press has trumpeted
the expectations that computerization would soon lead to productivity
spurts and also published stories that dash such hopes. A set of
stories from <i>Business Week</i> illustrates the conflicting themes in the business press.  In February 1994, <i>Business Week</i>
published two short articles by Gene Koretz: "Computers may really be
paying off: effect of automation on productivity in the workplace" and
... "And they're giving the U.S. a nice competitive edge." In January
1995, <i>Business Week</i> published a short article by Dean Foust, "Is the computer boost that big? Computers do not enhance productivity  very much." 

</p><p>Economists also differed in their beliefs about the relationship
between computerization and productivity growth. Many believed that
technological innovation was a major factor in national productivity
and assumed that investments in information technology would be
reflected in national statistics when the cumulative capital stock of
computer systems was large enough, they would result in improved
productivity statistics. Some economists coined the term "productivity
paradox", after Nobel laureate economist <a href="#Solow87">Robert Solow</a>
(1987) wrote, "You can see the computer age everywhere but in the
productivity statistics." Solow's assertion counters the common
assumption that computerization would directly and dramatically improve
productivity. Economists were divided in their explanations of the
productivity paradox. Some believed that their ways of measuring
productivity were inadequate; others argued that the capital stock of
information technology was still too small to have meaningful
consequences in national economic statistics; and still others argued
that lag effects were being underestimated. Still others believed that
mismanagement was a root cause of the productivity paradox.
</p><p>The "productivity paradox" is also an important social
phenomenon. Unfortunately, it is ignored in the technophillic press,
such as <i>Wired Magazine</i>, and is glossed by most of the pundits.
Within the United States, annual economic productivity has been growing
at a much slower rate in the mid-1970s through the 1990s than in the
1960s. For example, labor productivity in nonfarm business grew by 2.8
percent from 1960 to 1973 but grew by only 1.1 percent from 1973 to
1996 (<a href="#Webb98">Webb</a>, 1998). While the specific rates of
growth of labor productivity vary with the years counted, and do vary
within economic sectors, the general pattern of reductions in measured
labor productivity growth rates in the last two decades is well
accepted among economists. </p><p>Certainly many things have changed in industrial societies
between the first 20-year period after World War II and the most recent
20-year period. One set of changes is the proliferation of, and the
very deep investment in, computer and telecommunication systems. Since
the late 1980s, private firms in the U.S. have been investing about
half of their capital in information and communication technologies.
That investment includes telephone systems and voice mail as well as
computers. Still, it is a large fraction, and it has been sustained
since the "PC revolution." There has been a fairly intensive purchasing
campaign, and an increasing computerization campaign in major firms,
and it is beginning to show up in cumulative technology investments on
a significant scale. </p><p>This is the very period in which productivity gains are not going up by a factor of a hundred million -- the number that <a href="#Gilder98">Gilder</a>
(1998) likes to give as the gain in computing value since the 1950s. In
the U.S., labor productivity has grown 2-4% per year in this period.
Many people have assumed that computerization should directly and
dramatically improve productivity. Newer computer and telecommunication
systems may offer many advantages over traditional media or even older
computerized systems. However productivity gains may be hard to achieve
with the low-volume high-variety computer applications that many
professionals use. These may be called "productivity tools" but they
may do more to help improve the appearance of documents and
presentations, to deepen analysis, and to improve control over one&#8217;s
work relationships -- especially with reduced secretarial support.
These are valuable gains, but they may not translate into "throughput
productivity."
</p><p>Some economists are concerned about these matters and believe
that the productivity paradox is primarily "not real." It will be
resolved by improved ways to measure productivity and actually a larger
investment in computer systems. There is a lively debate between
economists and organizational analysts (see Kling, 1996b).
Organizational analysts suggest explanations that range from "We
haven&#8217;t learned how to use computers well enough at an organizational
and social scale" (<a href="#King96">King</a>, 1996), through describing many organizational processes and  work practices that reduce productivity in practice (<a href="#Attewell96">Attewell</a>,
1996). Such work practices include managers generating more numerous,
fine grained reports from information systems, authors making numerous
interim drafts of manuscripts, people fiddling with malfunctioning
computer systems, and so on. The managerial reports may help managers
feel more confident in taking certain actions, the incrementally
revised manuscripts may be improved, and so on. But these practices
don&#8217;t increase "throughput productivity."
</p><p>There are several social explanations for the productivity
paradox: (a) many organizations develop systems in ways that lead to a
large fraction of implementation failures; or (b) few organizations
design systems that effectively facilitate people&#8217;s work; or (c) we
significantly underestimate how much skilled work is required to
extract value from computerized systems. Taken together, these
observations suggest that many organizations lose potential value from
the ways that they computerize.
</p><p>Some recent studies indicate that information technology
investments have improved the productivity of some organizations and
national economies in the 1990s (<a href="#Brynjolfsson98">Brynjolfsson and Hitt</a>, 1998; <a href="#Dewan98">Dewan and Kraemer</a>, 1998).  However the firm-level data shows substantial variation across  firms (<a href="#Brynjolfsson98">Brynjolfsson and Hitt</a>,
1998: p.52). The evidence is accumulating that organizations which
computerize intensively with appropriate organizational practices are
more productive than the average, while those that do not organize
appropriately lag behind the firms that do not computerize intensively.
<a href="#Brynjolfsson98">Brynjolfsson and Hitt</a> (1998: p.54)
estimate that the inappropriately organized, highly computerized firms
lag the appropriately organized, highly computerized firms by 10
percent.
</p><p>Resolving the productivity paradox lies in the future. The
productivity paradox gives us reason to believe that current strategies
of computerization do not readily produce expected economic and social
benefits in a vast number of cases. In particular, technology alone,
even good technology alone, is not sufficient to create social or
economic value. This discussion offers an entry point into an
interesting set of studies and theories about the ways that effective
computerization depends upon close attention to workplace organization
and practices. I will discuss this idea in greater depth later on.
</p><p></p><h3>4.0 Early Research in Social Informatics</h3><p></p>

<p>Through the 1970s and 1980s, much of the social informatics research
focused on organizations because they were the major sites of
computerization. It is only in the last few years that many people who
are not themselves technical specialists have gotten computer systems
for home use. The era of the Internet, or particularly public access to
the Internet, raises issues of work at home, communication at home,
entertainment, access to medical information, and other personal uses.
These are significant phenomena, but are different from the topics I
will emphasize. They are part of social informatics, but they open up
different lines of analysis that warrant serious study and
understanding (see, for example, <a href="#Anderson95">Anderson</a>, et al.  1995; <a href="#Kahin95">Kahin and Keller</a>, 1995).

</p><p>In the 1970s and 1980s, often the questions about
computerization were phrased as deterministic impact questions, such
as: "What would be the impact of computers on organizational behavior
if we did X?"; "What would be the changes in social life if we did X?";
"Will computer systems, for example, improve or degrade the quality of
work?" There are a number of studies in which people try to answer this
last question, whether work life would improve for clerks, for
engineers, for managers, and so on. The questions were often phrased in
very simple, direct terms, namely: "What will happen, X or Y?" And the
answer was: "sometimes X, and sometimes Y." There was no simple, direct
effect. Much of the character of changes depended on the relative power
of workers. For example: clerks fared less well, on the average, than
professionals. But sometimes secretaries, who are the aristocrats of
the clerical class, were able to have greater improvements in their
worklives than were the people, primarily women, who were doing
transaction processing in the back rooms of banks and insurance
companies. Occupational power played an important role in mediating and
shaping the way that computerization restructured workplaces (See <a href="#Kling80">Kling</a>, 1980; <a href="#Attewell87">Attewell</a>, 1987; <a href="#Iacono87">Iacono and Kling</a>, 1987).

</p><p>Other sets of questions were also examined. To what extent were
organizations centralized? There were major arguments that computer
systems would enable upper managers to have much more detailed
information about the operations on workplaces, such as the shop floor,
the editorial room, and the classroom, and that organizations would
become more centralized. Others argued that they would become more
decentralized. Many people wanted to know: "Well, which is it? Is it A
or B?" Some studies found that information technology use led to some
organizations centralizing, and other studies found that information
technology use led to decentralization. Many of the arguments which
were engaged in a form of "Is it A or B?" were based upon simple
technological determinism which has not been borne out in reviews of
the careful studies (see <a href="#King83">King</a>, 1983; <a href="#George91">George and King</a>,
1991). The analytical failure of technological determinism is one of
the interesting and durable findings from social informatics research. </p><p>Today some analysts (and many pundits) frame claims about
information technology in social life in deterministic ways, with
claims such as, "The Web means that the public will get better
information than ever before." That framing is one that people who
study social informatics would be skeptical of. We ask: "When will the
Web enable the public to locate 'better information'? Under what
conditions? Who? For what?" Are people seeking information to help them
make a better choice of doctors, and then placing more trust in that
doctor. Or are people seeking alternatives to doctor-mediated medical
care -- whether information about health, herbal medicine or
post-operative care? Those contingency questions don&#8217;t lend themselves
to lively sound bites. But they do yield a very nuanced professional
understanding. This kind of <i>contextual inquiry</i> illustrates the
ways that social informatics researchers frame questions to develop an
analytical understanding of information technologies in social life. </p><p></p><h3>5.0 Some Key Ideas of Social Informatics</h3><p></p>


<p></p><h4>5.1  How Social Context Matters: Intranets in Action</h4><p></p>

<p>One way to illustrate a <i>contextual inquiry</i> of information technology in social life is to discuss some studies of the ways <a name="1" that=""></a>
 consulting firms have adopted and used computerized documentary systems<sup><a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/january99/kling/01notes.html#1">1</a></sup>.
One major consulting firm, Price Waterhouse, bought 10,000 copies of
Lotus Notes, documentary support system for their staff in 1989. Lotus
Notes is superficially similar to an Internet-like system with bulletin
boards and posting mechanisms and discussion groups and electronic mail
for organizations. Depending upon how Notes is used, it can act as an
e-mail system, a discussion system, an electronic publishing system,
and/or a set of digital libraries.
</p><p>Price Waterhouse is an international consulting firm with tens
of thousands of employees worldwide, and about 10,000 of them are
located in the United States. Their vice-president of information
systems believed that Lotus Notes was such a powerful technology that
it would sell itself, that the main thing to do was to rapidly roll it
out to the consulting staff, and let them use it to find creative ways
to share information. </p><p>He was concerned that his firm employed thousands of "line
consultants" in different offices all over North America, who work on
similar problems and who rarely share their expertise. Sometimes a
consulting team in Boston is dealing with the same kind of issue that a
consulting team in Toronto or San Francisco would be dealing with, or
very close. They had no easy way of sharing their growing understanding
of the problems they were facing with their clients. Could the firm&#8217;s
line consultants use some kind of communication and computerized
information system to store what they knew, and share it? </p><p>The first test was with the information technology staff. They
tended to use Notes; they found it interesting; and they used it fairly
aggressively for sharing information about their own projects.
Price-Waterhouse&#8217;s tax consultants in Washington, D.C., were another
group that used Lotus Notes (<a href="#Mehler92">Mehler</a>, 1992).
These tax consultants studied the behavior of the Internal Revenue
Service and the U.S. Congress, and disseminated tax advisories to Price
Waterhouse offices around the country about shifting changes in tax
legislation that might affect their clients. These tax consultants made
substantial use of Lotus Notes to broadcast their tax advisories.
</p><p>The line consultants were supposed to become Lotus Notes&#8217;
primary users. The Vice President of Information Technology felt that
Notes was so revolutionary that people didn&#8217;t even have to be shown how
to use it; examples could even stunt their imaginations. The
consultants should simply be given an opportunity to use it, and they
would learn how to use it in creative ways. Orlikowski (<a href="#Orlikowski93">Orlikowski</a> 1993)<a name="2"> </a> found that the senior line consultants, who were partners in the firm, tended to be modest users<sup><a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/january99/kling/01notes.html#2">2</a></sup>
. The more numerous junior line consultants, called associates, were
low users. They often seemed uninterested in learning how to use Notes,
readily gave up if they faced early frustrations with Notes, and as a
group did not spend much time with it. Here we have a pattern of
different groups in an organization having different practices in
working with Notes. How can we explain such differences? </p><p>One explanation focuses upon the incentive systems in the
firm. A good place to start our analysis is with the associate
consultants and the partners. Price Waterhouse -- and many other large
consulting firms in North America -- reviews its consultants through a
demanding promotion system. The associates are reviewed every two
years, for "up or out" promotions. In the first few rounds at major
firms, about half of the associates are fired at each review. In their
"up or out" system, the many associate consultants&#8217; goals are to be
promoted to the status of partner. Consultants who are promoted to the
status of partners can expect annual incomes over $300,000 at these
major firms. Partnerships are the golden ring that these firms use to
motivate their associate consultants.
</p><p>The associates are valued for their billable hours, and were
effectively required to bill almost all of their time. As they become
more senior, their ability to attract new business becomes more
critical. "Billable hours" means they have an account that they can
charge their time to. Lotus Notes, the revolutionary technology, was
not provided to them with a "training account" to bill their time to.
Consultants who wanted to use Notes had to have an account to charge
their time against, and the initial learning time was in the order of
20 to 30 hours. In 1991, the consultants were billed at about $150 an
hour, so they had to find a client who would be willing to pay $3,000
to $4,500 for them to learn a system whose value wasn&#8217;t yet clear to
them (but which could be revolutionary). Many had trouble justifying
that amount of expenditure to any of their clients at the time that
they were participating in the Notes rollout. There was a major
question about what would the consultants actually do with Notes after
they learned how to use it. Consequently, relatively few associates saw
value in Notes; there were no exemplary demonstrations showing them how
other successful line consultants used Notes. </p><p>On the other hand, the partners had substantial job security
(which was similar to university tenure). They could afford to
experiment with Notes. They were more willing to invest some time to
explore, often using e-mail, occasionally developing and sending memos,
and so on. This case study contradicts the popular "Nintendo
generation" explanation: "In the future, we don&#8217;t have to train people
about computing, because the Nintendo kids (or the Net kids) will learn
quickly." In this case, generally, younger consultants had less
incentive to learn Notes than did the middle-aged and elderly partners.
</p><p>But what about the information technology staff and the tax
consultants? These groups had a certain advantage in their forms of job
security. Many of the information technology staff were technophiles
who were willing to work with an interesting new application. Lotus
Notes has been helpful for people who can invest time in learning how
to use it, especially when they have joint projects and major
motivations for communicating, for documenting work, for sharing memos,
and so on.
</p><p>The tax consultants, who were located in Washington, D.C., had
a significant incentive to show that they were visible and valuable in
the firm. In their case, salary didn&#8217;t give them an incentive, it gave
them protection. Lotus Notes allowed them to broadcast for visibility:
it gave them the ability, in effect, to electronically publish their
advice and make it quickly available to many of the consultants around
the firm who wanted to read the Notes database. They hoped it would
enhance their visibility, and thus show that the Washington office was
not just overhead, but an important contributing part of the firm. In
short, organizational incentive systems were not part of the original
marketing story of Lotus Notes. The interesting information processing
features enabled by Lotus Notes were emphasized in numerous stories in
the technical press and (See, for example, <a href="#Kirkpatrick93">Kirkpatrick</a>, 1993.)  

</p><p>An organization, or organizational sub-units with different
incentive systems, might use Notes very differently. The way that some
consultants in Ernst and Young (E&amp;Y), another major consulting
firm, use Notes is instructive (<a href="#Davenport97">Davenport</a>, 1997; <a href="#Gierkink">Gierkink and Ruggles</a>,
n.d.). In brief, E&amp;Y created an organization (Center for Business
Knowledge) whose charter was to organize E&amp;Y&#8217;s consultants'
know-how in specific high profile areas. By 1997, E&amp;Y had developed
22 distinct social cross-office networks of consultants with expertise
in certain industries, organizational reforms, or technologies that
were a focus of E&amp;Y&#8217;s business. </p><p>Each network was assigned a half-time person to codify in
Notes databases the insights from specific consulting projects, to
prompt line consultants to add their own insights, and to edit and
prune a project&#8217;s discussion and document databases. In some cases,
they were charged to develop topical "Power Packs" in Notes -- a
structured and filtered set of online materials including sales
presentations and proposal templates. Davenport observed that these
"knowledge networkers" understood their network&#8217;s domains and that
these were short term assignments for line consultants. </p><p>In this case, E&amp;Y designed a human organizational
"intelligence system" for sharing insights, ideas, and materials in
specific topical areas. Lotus Notes served as an information support
system -- a medium for storing, organizing and communicating these
materials.
</p><p>Taken  together, these cases illustrate varied consequences of Notes&#8217; use in
large consulting firms, not one fixed effect.  Varied, conflicting consequences
in different settings is common in this body of research.  Our job as
researchers  is not simply to document the various consequences of
computerization, but also to theorize them  (see <a href="#Lamb96">Lamb</a>, 1996; <a href="#Robey97">Robey</a>, 1997). 
Different organizational incentive systems for different professionals is one
way to conceptualize a key concept that helps to integrate some of these seemingly
disparate cases. (Also see "<a href="#Markus94">Markus and Keil</a>, 1994 for a case study of a little
used large scale expert system whose use was not supported by organizational
incentive systems.) It is possible that the way that Notes is used at both
Price Waterhouse (now merged with Coopers-Lybrand) and E&amp;Y have changed since
the studies that inform this article were written. Our point here is not to
praise E&amp;Y and to criticize Price Waterhouse. Rather, it is to understand how
their behavior can help us develop empirically-grounded concepts that help us
to predict (or at least understand) variations in the ways that people and
groups use information technologies.

</p><p>One key idea of social informatics research is that the "social
context" of information technology development and use plays a
significant role in influencing the ways that people use information
and technologies, and thus influences their consequences for work,
organizations, and other social relationships. Social context does not
refer to some abstracted "cloud" that hovers above people and
information technology; it refers to a specific matrix of social
relationships. Here, social context is characterized by particular
incentive systems for using, organizing, and sharing information at
work. In the cases described above, different groups within Price
Waterhouse and E&amp;Y have different incentives to share information
about the project know-how, and, thus, how they use or avoid Lotus
Notes. </p><p>The case of E&amp;Y also illustrates an important idea -- that
of conceptualizing the design of computer and networked systems as a
set of interrelated decisions about technology and the organization of
work. Unfortunately, thinking and talking about computerization as the
development of socio-technical configurations, rather than as simply
installing and using a new technology, is not commonplace. It is common
for managers and technologists to discuss some social repercussions of
new technologies, such as the sponsorship of projects, training people
to use new systems, and controls over access to information. However,
these discussions usually treat all or most social behavior as
separable from the technologies, whereas the E&amp;Y case suggests how
a more integrated socio-technical view is critical. We will amplify
this key idea with additional examples.
</p><p></p><h4>5.2  Work Processes Matters With Documentary Systems</h4><p></p>

<p>The social informatics approaches have been applied to some issues
that are of particular concern to designers of digital libraries --
working with documentary systems. How do people work with documentary
systems in practice? We know that certain visions did not come about,
such as the early 1980s vision of the paperless office. It is
intriguing to speculate why one of the hot items in a "paperless
office" is a laser printer. Why are laser printer sales rising steadily
-- and faster ones, more colorful ones -- if the direction of
development is to abandon paper? There is a conceptual disconnect here.
It is not because people like paper in the same way that people have an
affection for dogs or cats. It is not a sentimental attachment. Laser
printers are not popular because people enjoy the look and feel of
typical 8-1/2" x 11", 20 pound bond.
</p><p>Some people do like the hand-feel of richly textured paper.  <i>Wired Magazine</i>,
at least, is printed in vivid colors. It is visually engaging, although
some people are put off by its intensely-colored pages. People at times
like books and other documents which are printed on nicely textured
paper. We should not ignore the sensual qualities of some high quality
papers. But standard 20 pound printer and copier papers are not
designed for sensuality.
</p><p>Careful studies of professional and clerical documentary work
find that many people engage in complex activities -- such as
annotating documents; comparing them, for instance, as an editor
compares two versions of a paper or a book chapter to see what the
changes were; or integrating them, for instance in assembling a long
report (see <a href="#Suchman96">Suchman</a>, 1996). The screen space
of the more common 14-, 15-, or even 17-inch displays are too limited.
To compare two full-page manuscripts, it helps to put them side by
side. That would require about 24 inches of display. Today, 24-inch
displays, priced at about $1500, are too costly for most offices. While
the costs and overall mass of large-screen monitors will decline in the
next decade, paper has other virtues. Many people who work with
multiple documents, mark them up with quick annotations and diagrams
that are more clumsy with word processors and take them to different
places; paper is simple and versatile.
</p><p>For certain transaction systems, such as airline reservation
systems, the move to paperless transactions has been workable --
because it reduces operational costs in re-issuing new tickets and
people make few additional notations on their tickets. In contrast,
people who are doing analytical work with manuscripts have found paper
to be an extremely durable and useful medium, for a variety of reasons.
Some of the value of paper is based on the work of comparing and
working with documents side by side. It is partly a real estate issue,
and partly a portability issue -- documents can be moved around an
office or taken off-site quickly and easily without having to have a
running device. </p><p>Paper plays important roles in some places where we don&#8217;t
think it is in use. An interesting example is in civilian air traffic
control systems. The movie version of air traffic controllers shows
them staring at bright green displays. In real-life they do depend upon
computer displays. But they also keep track of the planes that they are
monitoring on little pieces of paper a little bigger than that of
fortune cookies, which record flights, flight vectors, and speed, among
other things. Because they divide their work by air space, when the
plane moves from one scope to the next, they pass the paper over. <a href="#Stix94">Gary Stix</a>
(1994) examines (a) the nature of the work and communication via paper
strips, and (b) IBM&#8217;s efforts in 1993 to automate it. Stix reports that
IBM had a database with 65 fields -- a little complicated for real time
control! That project has since been abandoned by the FAA in the United
States at a cost of several hundreds of millions dollars. But the FAA
will continue to develop upgrades, because the computers on which the
air traffic control system runs are aging, and it is hard to get spare
parts, technicians, and so on.
</p><p>This "work-oriented view" of how people work and use computer
systems in practice is not always inspiring. Many people work hard, and
they do many interesting things, but their work with information
technologies is not streamlined. Professionals, for example, often work
across media, across technologies, and across social boundaries in ways
that new, computer-based systems don&#8217;t readily integrate. Their
workspaces can appear messy and their workflow cumbersome, even when
they have good computer systems to help with part of their work. Social
informatics is one sustained way of understanding these issues in ways
that do help improve the workability and design of systems and
information services for various workers and the public. </p><p></p><h4>5.3 Socio-technical Systems and Electronic Journals</h4><p></p>  

<p>The use of the Internet to support scientific communication is one
of the major shifts in the practice of science in this era and it has
generated numerous experiments and significant discussion. In the
scientific communities, these communications include informal e-mail,
the communication of conference programs as they gel, the sharing of
preprints, access to electronic versions of journal articles, and the
development of shared disciplinary corpuses. These communicative
practices are becoming more important in many fields, although they are
rarely the central communications media. However, only a few analyses
take sufficient account of the ways in which the social dimensions of
publications, such as the design of electronic journals, influence
their use (see, for example, <a href="#Kling95">Kling and Covi</a>, 1995).

</p><p>One common approach to conceptualizing new forms such as
electronic journals, on-line newspapers, electronic forums, Web sites
and digital libraries emphasizes their technologically-based
information-processing features, such as enabling authors and readers
to communicate more directly without the mediation of libraries or
expensive publishers. The socio-technical approach, explained below,
views these new forms as mixing together both technological elements
and social relationships into an effectively inseparable ensemble. </p><p>From a technological  information processing<a name="3"> </a>perspective, new media such as electronic journals<sup><a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/january99/kling/01notes.html#3">3</a></sup>,
databases, preprint servers -- are said to reduce the costs of
communication, expand the range of people and locations from which
materials are accessible, and generally speed communications. According
to this view, as scholars in all scientific fields work with data, and
communicate both formally and informally with other scholars, all of
these electronic media forums should be adopted and used fairly
uniformly. Differences in value would rest upon the differences in
technical architectures. For example, readers would be more likely to
read electronic journal A rather than journal B if journal A added more
informational value, such as having an elaborate set of cross links
between articles, or including more extensive sets of data and
graphics. </p><p>Even the strongest proponents of electronic journals agree
that technological design alone is not sufficient to insure a good
quality journal. There is a strong consensus that the quality of a
journal&#8217;s scholarly content is important in making it viable, but there
is substantial disagreement about the means of attracting high quality
materials. All the proposals and counter proposals for attracting high
quality authors rest on social analyses of a journal, rather than
purely technological analyses. <a name="4">For</a> example, one aspect electronic journals that is commonly discussed is the role of peer review<sup><a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/january99/kling/01notes.html#4">4</a></sup>.
There are many ways of organizing peer reviews, but each strategy for
selecting reviewers and translating their assessments into feedback for
authors and publication criteria for the journal is a social process.
These social processes are supported by communication media, and
electronic media may facilitate or inhibit specific ways of organizing
reviewers, reviewing and editing.
</p><p>The value of a socio-technical analysis can be illustrated by
contrasting the design and functioning of two different electronic
journals: the <i>Electronic Transactions of Artificial Intelligence</i> and <i>The Electronic Journal of Cognitive and Brain Sciences</i>.
Superficially, these scientific electronic journals have much in
common: each is hosted on a Web site, relies upon peer review to select
high quality articles, and posts articles for public pre-review before
they are accepted or rejected for formal publication. Both journals
were established in 1997 and have had about 18 months of activity to
establish a publishing pattern. These two journals are especially
interesting in the ways that their designers envision attracting
authors to submit high quality articles, and to insure that only high
quality articles are actually published. </p><p>However, one of these journals seems to be viable and one
seems moribund. The technological publication system for each journal
functions effectively, and I will indicate how the differences rest on
their design as socio-technical systems. Rather than analyze the
journals as I describe them, I believe that it would be useful for
readers to note the contrasts in the two journals' designs, and to try
to evaluate which journal is the more viable and why.
</p><p> <i>Electronic Transactions on Artificial Intelligence</i> (<i>ETAI</i>):

</p><p>The ECCAI (European Coordinating Committee for Artificial Intelligence) announced the <i>ETAI</i>
as a journal in May 1997, with Professor Erik Sandewall, a pioneer of
artificial intelligence research in Scandinavia, as its
Editor-in-Chief. The journal&#8217;s editors and organizers sought to make
the review process of articles more open for authors and readers, by
making some aspects of an article&#8217;s review very public. <i>ETAI&#8217;s</i> editors claim: 

</p><p>"The <i>ETAI</i> represents a novel approach to electronic
publishing. We do not simply inherit the patterns from the older
technology, but instead we have rethought the structure of scientific
communication in order to make the best possible use of international
computer networks as well as electronic document and database
technologies."
</p><p>They describe their editorial process as follows:

</p><p>"Articles submitted to the <i>ETAI</i> are reviewed in a 2-phase
process. After submission, an article is open to public online
discussion in the area's News Journal [part of the journal&#8217;s Web site].
After the discussion period of three months, and after the authors have
had a chance to revise it, the article is reviewed for acceptance by
the <i>ETAI</i>, using confidential peer review and journal level
quality criteria. This second phase is expected to be rather short
because of the preceding discussion and possible revision. During the
entire reviewing process, the article is already published in a "First
Publication Archive", which compares to publication as a departmental
tech report." (From <i>ETAI</i>, 1997; see <a href="#Sandewall98">Sandewall</a>, 1998  for a more elaborate description of their editorial process.)

</p><p>The <i>ETAI</i> is divided into several topical sections, each section with its own section editor.  The <i>ETAI</i>
Web site has a public discussion section linked to each submitted
article. An annual paper edition of the articles, without the
discussion, is published by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences
(KVA). </p><p><i>The Electronic Journal of Cognitive and Brain Sciences</i> (<i>EJCBS</i>)  

</p><p>The <i>EJCBS</i> was devised by Dr.  Zoltan  Nadasdy of Rutgers University as an e-journal "that works without editors" and which offers<a name="5"> the</a> following features (<a href="#Nadasdy98a">Nadasdy</a>, 1998a)<sup><a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/january99/kling/01notes.html#5">5</a></sup>: 

</p><p>"Instead of a hidebound peer-review system, we use an
interactive "vote," in which those with comments and suggestions post
them along with the article. </p><p>"Instead of a lengthy discussion carried out over a period of
months and years as letters are submitted to journals and await
publication, we allow anyone to post letters, and allow authors to
answer them immediately. </p><p>"Instead of layout designers, we make use
of...automated-formatting software that converts simple ASCII documents
into HTML. The system supports graphical illustrations and
automatically inserts them into the text. Hypertext is also inserted
into the articles."
</p><p>Nadasdy sought to devise "an autonomous system" that could run
on its own after it was programmed. It would rely upon readers to be
referees, and not rely upon an editorial board. He designed it with the
aim "that [it] would be able to control itself based on reasonable
rules". He developed software to automatically create a Web page with
graphics for each submitted article, so that no human editorial
activity would be required to post articles.
</p><p>"<i>EJCBS</i> uses a two-tier acceptance procedure that makes
reviewing automatic and allows readers to control final acceptance:
review status and archive status. Papers in review status are evaluated
by the readers...a weight system controls the score given by different
reader categories. The scores are transferred to a database that will
be averaged at the end of a month, and the final status of the paper
will be decided accordingly. Articles that receive a certain average
score, or higher, are transferred to an archive of accepted papers.
Those papers that do not receive the minimal average scores are
rejected."
</p><p>Nadasdy designed <i>EJCBS</i> to improve the speed of
publication, be low cost, enhance interactivity, and enable broad
distribution. He claims that "those features are all integrated into
the system I call "interactive publishing." The impact of interactive
publishing could be enormous. It redefines concepts of traditional
publishing, such as editing, acceptance, reviews and comments, and
archives."
</p><p>The reviewing practices of <i>EJCBS</i> and <i>ETAI</i> differ considerably.  <i>EJCBS</i>
relies on anonymous reviewing by (self-selected) readers. They visit
its Web site and rate an article on several seven-point scales to
indicate their views of its quality and importance. Nadasdy hoped that <i>EJCBS</i>
could "run itself" and has tried to automate key editorial processes.
It is an extreme example of removing editorial attention and guidance
from the publishing process and relying upon a readers&#8217; plebiscite.
</p><p>In contrast, an article that is submitted to <i>ETAI</i>, is a
topic for public discussion by participants in the research community.
During the three month open review period, questions and comments are
signed. In an informal reading of the discussion about several
articles, I found that only a few questions were typically posted.
However, they reflected a deep understanding of the topics, and some
were elaborate counter-examples or reformulations of the authors&#8217;
positions. Authors' replies were also public, and seemed to engage the
technical issues raised in the queries. </p><p>Both <i>ETAI</i> and <i>EJCBS</i> were initiated in 1997.  The <i>ETAI</i> accepted five articles for publication in 1997 while <i>EJCBS</i> posted two short articles in September 1997, but has not accepted any.  The <i>ETAI</i> continues to receive a steady stream <a name="6">of</a> submissions (eight articles in 1998) while the <i>EJCBS</i> does not<sup><a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/january99/kling/01notes.html#6">6</a></sup>.  The contrast between the <i>ETAI</i> and the <i>EJCBS</i> offers and interesting illustration of a (simplified) socio-technical systems analysis.

</p><p></p><h4> 5.3.1  Socio-technical Systems</h4><p></p>

<p>Social informatics research has produced some useful ideas and
findings that are applicable to many kinds of information technologies
and shed interesting light on these dilemmas of Internet use. The
concept of "computerized information systems as social technical
systems" is one such idea that helps us understand the character of
e-journals, as well as other e-media.
</p><p>Information and communication technologies are often discussed
as tools or simple appliances, even when they refer to complex
arrangements of varied equipment, rules/roles/resources, and actual
organizational practices, as with WWW sites or airline reservation
systems. It is more interesting <a name="7">to</a> view specific information technologies as "socio-technical systems"<sup><a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/january99/kling/01notes.html#7">7</a></sup>
  -- a complex, interdependent system comprised of:
</p><ul>
<li>people in various roles and relationships with each other and with other system elements;
</li><li>hardware (computer mainframes, workstations, peripherals, telecommunications equipment); 
</li><li> software (operating systems, utilities and application programs); 
</li><li>techniques  (management science models, voting schemes);
</li><li> support resources (training/support/help); and
</li><li>information structures (content and content providers,
rules/norms/regulations, such as those that authorize people to use
systems and information in specific ways, access controls).
</li></ul>	 
<p>These elements are not simply a static list, but <a name="8">are</a> interrelated within a matrix of social and technical dependencies<sup><a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/january99/kling/01notes.html#8">8</a></sup>. 

</p><p>A systems designer with a socio-technical orientation does not
simply consider these elements while working in a "design studio" far
away from the people who will use a specific system. Effectively
designing socio-technical systems also requires upon a set of
"discovery processes" to help the designers understand which features
and tradeoffs will most appeal <a name="9">to</a> the people who are most likely to use the system<sup><a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/january99/kling/01notes.html#9">9</a></sup>.
There are a number of discovery processes for learning about the
preferences of the men and women who are likely to use these systems.
These discovery processes include workplace ethnography (<a href="#Simonsen97">Simonsen and Kensing</a>, 1997), focus groups, user participation in design teams  (<a href="#Bolstrom77b">Bolstrom and Heinen</a>, 1977b; <a href="#Carmel93">Carmel, Whittaker and George</a>, 1993), and participatory design strategies (<a href="#Schuler93">Schuler and Namioka</a>, 1993; <a href="#Eckehard97">Eckehard</a>,
et al. 1997). These approaches differ in many significant ways, such as
the contextual richness of the understandings that they reveal and the
extent to which they give the people who will use systems influence and
power in their design. These issues are the subject of a lively body of
research that overlaps social informatics. However, to discuss it in
detail here would lead us away from our focus on the structural
elements of a socio-technical analysis.
</p><p>For our post-hoc analytical purposes, we can focus on the
structural features of the socio-technical system that we have listed
above. We view the design of <i>ETAI</i> and <i>EJCBS</i> not simply
as one of artifacts, such as the compilers that Nadasdy developed to
automatically translate submitted article files into postable WWW pages
for <i>EJCBS</i>. Rather, the interplay of social assumptions and
practices that are reflected in technological design features helps us
to understand the relative success of these two e-journals.
</p><p>In the case of <i>ETAI</i>, authors link up with potential
readers through the journal&#8217;s published articles. However, in order to
have an article published, an author must be willing to discuss it in a
public forum with other self-identified artificial intelligence (AI)
researchers. This arrangement adds an important social and discursive
element to publishing in the journal: authors must be willing to
participate in this part of the AI community by discussing their
research. Publication in <i>ETAI</i> entails a set of relatively public social actions.  Further, the editorial board of the <i>ETAI</i>
was developed to include senior members European Coordinating Committee
for Artificial Intelligence and paper publication through the Royal
Swedish Academy of Sciences. Potential authors have good reason to
believe that their articles will be known to participants in the
European AI research community. According to Erik Sandewall, this
visibility is a mixed blessing: it can enhance one&#8217;s status for work
that is well received, but also can be embarrassing for authors whose
work is ill-conceived, not well developed, or is not well received.
</p><p>The <i>EJCBS</i> looks more problematic as a socio-technical
system. An author who submits an article will receive votes and
possible comments from anonymous readers, but does not have a forum in
which to respond or to develop a discussion with the readers. While the
<i>ETAI</i> has an editorial board whose members participate in a
variety of high status scientific social networks and promote the
journal, the <i>EJCBS</i> was designed by one relatively low status
and not well connected bio-scientist who would like to have it work
without promotional or editorial attention -- autonomously. Authors who
publish in <i>EJCBS</i> are not guaranteed any attention among highly active scientists in their field.  
 
</p><p><a href="#Nadasdy98b">Nadasdy</a> (1998b) believes that he has
"shown that the (journal) concept works, and that people just have to
come around to use it." His comment reflects a technologically focussed
view of e-publishing, one which pays much more attention to automating
scripts and voting procedures than in seeking ways to effectively
mobilize a lively group of authors and readers around the journal. </p><p>I have developed these two examples at some length because
they help us to see how a socio-technical perspective on e-journals
helps us to better understand how they may or may not serve as vibrant
media for community communication. Nadasdy did "market the journal" by
encouraging about 100 senior scientists to publish their articles in
it. A few of them sent encouraging comments, but none submitted their
research articles for review and possible publication. Nadasdy&#8217;s
software works; if an e-journal is only a technological artifact, he
"has a working journal." However, a genuine "working journal" requires
a continuing stream of authors and readers, then the design requires a
more sophisticated social-technical approach than Nadasdy has taken on.
These ideas extend beyond e-journals, to digital libraries, electronic
forums and so on.
</p><p>It is also possible to revisit the cases of Lotus Notes use in
consulting firms to examine their design as socio-technical
communication systems within the social networks of the firms. One
major difference between Price Waterhouse and E&amp;Y lies in E&amp;Y&#8217;s
creating new social groups with a responsibility for collecting,
organizing and disseminating information for which Lotus Notes could be
a helpful medium. </p><p>Further, the concept of socio-technical systems can help us
understand some of the differences between WWW sites and digital
libraries that are highly used or little used. As technological
systems, they are collections of software, data (text, picture files,
etc.), links, and metadata (indices, etc.) that run on networked
computers. As socio-technical systems, we can pay special attention to:
</p><ul>
<li>people in various roles and relationships with each other and with other system elements;
</li><li>support resources (training/support/help); and
</li><li>information structures (content and content providers,
rules/norms/regulations, such as those that authorize people to use
systems and information in specific ways, access controls).
</li></ul> and ask about the importance of their content for various
constituencies, who is authorized to change content and how that
matters, etc. <p>There are many such questions that help us connect technological
artifacts in a lively way to a social world. As a design practice, a
"socio-technical approach" also requires a discovery process that helps
designers to effectively understand the relevant lifeworlds and
workworlds of the people who will use their systems. </p><p></p><h4>5.4  Computing Infrastructure and Public Access to Information via the Internet</h4><p></p>

<p>There are innumerable examples of the use and value of the Internet
in providing new kinds of communications to support a cornucopia of
human activities in virtually every profession and kind of institution.
In the U.S., the professional and middle classes have found the
Internet to be useful for communication with some government agencies,
for some forms of shopping, for tackling investments, maintaining ties
with friends and family via email, and as a source of entertainment. </p><p>There are also many examples where the Internet enables the
middle class public to have better access to important information (See
<a href="#Kahin95">Kahin and Keller</a>, 1995). In the U.S., the public
is beginning to turn to medical sources on the Web, to get alternative
answers on the Internet, in discussion groups and so on, and sometimes
bypassing the medical establishment. </p><p>Some people seek either alternative medical advice or
information about issues that their doctors don&#8217;t deal with very well.
Surgeons, for example, may be good at doing very skilled surgery, but
they may not be very good for giving people an understanding of what it
takes to go through the recovery process. People sometimes find that
certain Internet sources can be extremely helpful as either
alternatives or supplements. This is simply a hypothesis, but there is
anecdotal evidence that the Internet provides an alternative
communication means for many middle class people to bypass the medical
establishment. Anecdotal evidence suggests that doctors vary in their
responses to their patients feeling better informed, and sometimes
challenging their advice -- from encouragement to annoyance. What kinds
of changes in systematic patient-doctor relationships may result is as
yet unclear. </p><p>In the United States, Vice-President Al Gore promotes
networking for libraries, clinics, and schools, by arguing that if they
are wired together, their use will improve public education and enable
substantially improved public services. How to actually transform such
networks into meaningful social support systems is a question that
remains unanswered.
</p><p>While many people install additional phone lines for online
computer use, affordable telephone service and Internet service
providers (ISPs) are available in urban areas (<a href="#Kahin95">Kahin and Keller</a>,
1995). Access to ISPs, and even basic telephone service, is more
problematic in many rural areas. In 1995, about 28.8 million people in
the United States 16 years and over had access to the Internet at work,
school or home; 16.4 million people used the Internet and 11.5 million
people of these people used the Web. About 80 per cent of these people
used the Internet at least once a week. However, about 182 million
people 16 years and over did not have access to the Internet (<a href="#Hoffman96">Hoffman, Kalsbeek, and Novak</a>,
1996). A 1997 nation-wide household study found that computer ownership
and e-mail access were rising rapidly -- about 94% of households have
telephones, 37% have personal computers; 26% have modems, and 19% have
on-line access (<a href="#McConnaughey98">McConnaughey and Lader</a>.  1998).  The numbers of people with Internet access continues to rise rapidly.  

</p><p>It might appear that technological access is the primary
roadblock to expanded Internet use. "Technological access" refers to
the physical availability of suitable equipment, including computers of
adequate speed and equipped with appropriate software for a given
activity. Scenarios of "ordinary people" using the Internet often
assume that computer support is easy to organize, and that access to
information and services is not problematic.
</p><p>In contrast, "social access" refers to know-how, a mix of
professional knowledge economic resources, and technical skills, to use
technologies in ways that enhance professional practices and social
life. In practice, social access -- the abilities of diverse
organizations and people from many walks of life to actually use these
services -- will be critical if they are to move from the laboratories
and pilot projects into widespread use where they can vitalize the
nation and the economy. Social access should not be viewed as an "add
on" to a technological structure. Many systems designers have learned,
for example, that a well designed systems does not simply tack on a
"computer interface" after its internal structure has been set in
place. The design of human interfaces and internal structures is highly
coupled for systems that effectively support people&#8217;s work and
communication (see National Research Council, 1997 for an integrated
review). In a similar way, social access is integral to the design and
development of systems and services that are to be widely used.
</p><p>Some analysts do not view social access to the Internet for
"ordinary people" as problematic, since they believe that access costs
will rapidly decline and the public&#8217;s computing skills will continue to
rise. In this view, time and markets will resolve most access issues.
In contrast, we believe that social access to the Internet is likely to
prove vexing for many people, based on what careful studies of computer
use and Internet use have shown us. </p><p>Although 50% of US households may have computers by the year
2000, organizations have been the major sites for adopting networked
information systems, especially as implementers of advanced
technologies. There are few studies of computer use in households. In
one careful study of "ordinary households" (HomeNet), researchers found
that using the Internet is too hard for many "ordinary people" (<a href="#Kiesler-etal97">Kiesler, Kraut, Mukhopadhyay, and Scherlis</a>.  1997):

</p><p>"Over 70% of the households called the help desk. Calls to the
help desk represented the behavior of some of the more sophisticated
users. Less sophisticated users dropped out once they hit usability
barriers. The kinds of problems logged by help desk staff included
problems in installing phone service, configuring the telecommunication
software, busy signals (users often blamed themselves!), buggy
software, inexperience with mice, keyboards, scroll bars, terminology,
radio buttons, and menus. Yet, in our home interviews, we noted there
were many more problems participants had not called about. </p><p>".. we thought that as everyone learned how to use the
computer and what the Internet could do for them, the influence of
their initial computer skill would decline with time. We were wrong.
Even after a year of experience with the Internet, participant's
initial computer skill still constrained their Internet usage. This
result held across different gender and age groups."
</p><p>These findings serve as a cautionary note about our expecting
the North American public to rapidly form a "network nation." One
intriguing finding of the HomeNet project is that families with
adolescents made much more use of the Internet than those without. We
suspect that many of these teenagers became critical "on-site"
technical consultants for their parents. </p><p></p><h4>5.4.1 Infrastructure for Computing Support is Social as Well as Technological</h4><p></p> 

<p>PCs are much more complicated to install and use for a diverse array
of tasks than are "turnkey appliances" such as televisions and VCRs.
While it is a standing joke that most people don't know how to program
their VCRs (and thus watch an LCD blinking 00:00), most people can
reliably play a videotape and enjoy the resulting entertainment. In
contrast, PCs that use networked services require much more complex
configurations (including data rates and IP numbers) that can change
with changes in network configurations and service providers. </p><p>Effective computer systems that use Internet services will
require reliable complementary technological resources -- such as
printers, electricity (reliable in urban settings, sometimes
problematic after disasters and in remote regions). What is less well
appreciated is how the infrastructure for making computer systems
workable also includes a variety of resources that are social in
character. Skilled technical installers, trainers and consultants are
the most obvious social resources. In addition, people who use advanced
networking applications need know-how -- to be able to learn to
effectively integrate them into their working practices -- based on
learning from others. </p><p>There is some debate about how much computer use has
simplified in the last decade. It is probably easier to use a
stand-alone PC "out of the box." However, the dominant operating
systems, such as Windows 95/98/NT, Unix (and Linux) can still stump
experts when applications or components interact badly. </p><p>System infrastructure is a socio-technical system since
technical capabilities depend upon skilled people, administrative
procedures, etc.; and social capabilities are enabled by simpler
supporting technologies (e.g., word processors for creating technical
documents, cellular telephones and pagers for contacting rapid-response
consultants) (<a href="#Kling92">Kling</a>, 1992). Malfunctioning
computer systems are not simply an opportunity loss, such as a book
that is bought but not read. When people organize their days about the
expectations that key technologies will work well -- and they don't --
they often spend considerable time tinkering to get systems to work,
waiting for help to come, and so on. </p><p>Workable computer applications are usually supported by a
strong socio-technical infrastructure. The "surface features" of
computer systems are the most visible and the primary subject of
debates and systems analysis. But they are only one part of
computerization projects. Many key parts of information systems are
neither immediately visible or interesting in their novelty. They
include technical infrastructure, such as reliable electricity (which
may be a given in urban America, but problematic in wilderness areas,
or in urban areas after a major devastation.) They also involve a range
of skilled-support -- from people to document systems features and
train people to use them to rapid-response consultants who can diagnose
and repair system failures
</p><p>Much of the research about appropriate infrastructure comes from studies of systems that underperformed or failed (<a href="#Star96">Star and Ruhleder</a>, 1996; <a href="#Kling-Scacchi82">Kling and Scacchi</a>,1982).
The social infrastructure for a given computer system is not
homogeneous across social sites. For example, the Worm Community System
was a collaboratory for molecular biologists who worked in hundreds of
university laboratories; key social infrastructure for network
connectivity and (UNIX) skills depended upon the laboratory's work
organization (and local university resources) (See <a href="#Star96">Star and Ruhleder</a>,
1996). Researchers found that the Worm Community System was technically
well designed; but it was rather weak as an effective collaboratory
because of the uneven and often limited support for its technical
requirements in various university labs. In short, a weak local
socio-technical infrastructure can undermine the effective workability
of computer systems, including those in people&#8217;s homes, as we have
discussed above (also see <a href="#Haddon95">Haddon and Silverstone</a>, 1995).

</p><p></p><h3>6.0 Why Social Informatics Matters</h3><p></p>

<p>Social informatics research pertains to information technology use
and social change in any sort of social setting, not just
organizations. Social informatics researchers are specially interested
in developing reliable knowledge about information technology and
social change, based on systematic empirical research, to inform both
public policy debates and professional practice. Many of us have
developed concepts to help understand the design, use, configuration,
and/or consequences of information and communication technologies so
that they are actually workable for people. This contrasts with high
spirited but largely a-priori promotions of technologies that
occasionally work well for people, occasionally are valuable, are
sometimes abandoned, are sometimes unusable, and thus incur predictable
waste and inspire misplaced hopes. That is one important way that
"social informatics matters" and one that I have emphasized in this
article. This view of social informatics has important repercussions
for public policy, professional practice, and the education of
information technology professionals (see <a href="#Kling93">Kling</a>, 1993; <a href="#Kling-Allen96">Kling and Allen</a>, 1996; <a href="#Kling-etal99">Kling, Crawford, Rosenbaum, Sawyer, and Weisband</a>, 1999).

</p><p>Social informatics research also investigates intriguing new
social phenomena that emerge when people use information technology,
such as the ways that people develop trust in virtual teams (<a href="#Iacono97">Iacono and Weisband</a>, 1997) or the ways that disciplinary norms influence scholars use of electronic communication media (<a href="#Kling-McKim">Kling and McKim,</a> in press).  But  these phenomena would be the focus of another article.

</p><p>In this article I have identified a few key ideas that come from
25 years of systematic analytical and critical research about
information technology and social life. There are other sources for a
more expanded treatment (see, for example <a href="#Kling93">Kling</a>, 1993; <a href="#Kling-Allen96">Kling and Allen</a>, 1996; <a href="#Bishop96">Bishop and Star</a>, 1996; <a href="#Kling-Star98">Kling and Star</a>, 1998; <a href="#Kling-etal99">Kling, Crawford, Rosenbaum, Sawyer, and Weisband</a>, 1999).  

</p><p>Other social informatics researchers might emphasize other
ideas. I have emphasized organizational examples because information
technology and organizational change (organizational informatics) have
been more carefully researched and theorized in complex organizations
than computer use in settings such as households.
</p><p></p><h3>7.0 Social Informatics as a Field Name
</h3><p></p>

<p>Social informatics is a neologism. I have written enthusiastically
about social informatics, but many people are appropriately cautious
about catchy new terms whose connotations can mislead. The label
"social informatics" emerged from discussions in 1996 within the
community of researchers who conduct the kind of research discussed in
this article. Several social informatics researchers participated in a
workshop at UCLA on social aspects of digital libraries in 1996 (see <a href="http://dlis.gseis.ucla.edu/DL/">http://dlis.gseis.ucla.edu/DL/</a>).
In the course of discussing research about digital libraries and
computer supported cooperative work (CSCW), we realized that we did not
have a good label for the body of research that we now call social
informatics. We used various labels, including "social analysis of
computing," "social impacts of computing," "information systems
research," and "behavioral information systems research."
</p><p>Several of us felt that it was time to help make this body of
ongoing research much more accessible by finding one name that could
serve as an efficient pointer, and a banner. Instead of being skeptical
of new nomenclature, we should be willing to find a field name that we
could use. A number of us discussed alternatives such as "social
analysis of computing," "interpretive informatics," "socio-technical
systems" -- and the term "social informatics" came up as the least
offensive alternative of the group. For some people it inspired
curiosity; for others, it simply was not a turn-off, whereas for some,
"interpretive informatics" tended not to cross cultural lines.
</p><p>The social informatics label energizes some faculty. One
colleague at another university told me that he didn&#8217;t know how to
succinctly characterize his interests when he was searching for a
professorship. When he learned about social informatics, he felt that
it was a terrific label for his interests. But I also know some
faculty, especially those who are in single-discipline academic units,
whose research comfortably fits within social informatics who will
resist the term because adopting it doesn&#8217;t help them in their
struggles for research resources, good students, and impact for their
research within their traditionally defined disciplines.
</p><p>There are a number of journals which publish social informatics
research. A comprehensive list would be lengthy; but most of the
journals listed would be ones that have published only a few social
informatics articles. There are a few journals that are good sources of
social informatics research, including <i>The Information Society</i> and some journals in the information systems field, such as <i>Information Systems Research</i>.  Social informatics studies appear in communication journals such as the  <i>Journal of Communication</i> as well as in the electronic <i>Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication</i>.  The <i>Journal of the American Society of Information Science</i> published a special issue in October 1998 devoted to social informatics (Kling, Rosenbaum and Hert, 1998). The <i>Communications of the ACM</i>, a magazine, also publishes articles that are based on social informatics research. There are numerous books (see <a href="#Dutton97">Dutton</a>, 1997; <a href="#Huff94">Huff and Finholt</a> (1994); <a href="#Kling96">Kling</a>, 1996;  <a href="#Kiesler97">Kiesler</a>, 1997; <a href="#Smith98">Smith and Kollock</a>, 1998; and <a href="#DeSanctis">DeSanctis and Fulk</a>
(in press) as entry points). The research is conducted in several
different disciplines, especially in some social sciences, information
science, computer science and information systems.
</p><p>The National Science Foundation sponsored a workshop on
Advances in Organizational and Social Informatics in the Fall of 1997
to help to further develop the field (see <a href="http://memex.lib.indiana.edu/siwkshop/SocInfo1.html">http://memex.lib.indiana.edu/siwkshop/SocInfo1.html</a>).
The workshop&#8217;s participants characterized social informatics as: "the
interdisciplinary study of the design, uses and consequences of
information and communication technologies that takes into account
their interaction with institutional and cultural contexts." </p><p>This characterization sets some boundaries as well as
articulating a focus for social informatics. For example, simple
surveys of the number of people who use the Internet for specific
purposes that did not examine these uses in institutional and cultural
contexts would not be a social informatics study. However, such survey
data could be useful as part of a social informatics analysis. </p><p>In addition, the workshop participants characterized social informatics research as analytical, critical or normative.  The <i>analytical orientation</i>
refers to studies that develop theories about information technologies
in institutional and cultural contexts or to empirical studies that are
organized to contribute to such theorizing. I have emphasized
analytical research in this short article. The <i>critical orientation</i>
refers to examining information technologies from perspectives that do
not automatically and "uncritically" adopt the goals and beliefs of the
groups that commission, design, or implement specific information
technologies. </p><p>Our discussion of the use of Lotus Notes in light of
organizational incentive structures illustrates the analytical
orientation in social informatics. The critical orientation is possibly
the most novel (<a href="#Agre97">Agre and Schuler</a>, 1997). It
encourages professionals and researchers to examine information
technologies from multiple perspectives (such as the various people who
use them in different contexts, as well as people who design, implement
or maintain them), and to examine possible "failure modes" and service
losses, as well as ideal or routine ICT operations. This article
illustrates a critical perspective in the examination of Lotus Notes&#8217;
use, the design of electronic journals, and public access to the
Internet.
</p><p>A book based on this workshop examines the character of the field, some of the key ideas, and teaching issues (<a href="#Kling-etal99">Kling, Crawford, Rosenbaum, Sawyer and Weisband</a>,
1999). It also includes discussions of ways to develop the field,
communicate key ideas of social informatics to relevant scholarly and
professional communities, and to enrich the curricula for
computing-oriented students.
</p><p>Social informatics has a Web page at <a href="http://www.slis.indiana.edu/SI">http://www.slis.indiana.edu/SI</a>
and a small collection of on-line discussion forums. The WWW page
includes sections that list and link courses, research conferences,
degree programs, and so on. There are many opportunities to conduct
research in social informatics, to translate research ideas into
professional practice or to teach. I invite you to join us in a lively
adventure.
