And yet, despite all of this work, use of QoS is very limited. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have implemented QoS to support their own voice and video services, but do not offer QoS to their subscribers for use by any other Internet applications. ISPs have not incorporated QoS into their interconnection agreements, and hence end-to-end QoS is not available. The limited deployment of QoS has ignited vigorous debate over <a href="net neutrality.html">Net Neutrality</a>, which has become the most contentious telecommunications public policy issue in decades.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="Body">End-to-end QoS deployment requires an interdisciplinary approach that integrates network architecture, economics, and law. Internet architecture has not adequately considered the economic motivations of ISPs; QoS will be deployed and used only when there is a business case for it. The network economics literature has only modeled network access, not QoS. Law will dictate what ISPs can do; it may make QoS illegal, may allow QoS but prohibit charging for it, or may allow ISPs to not offer QoS to competitors.      This project will  address the lack of QoS availability to applications, the lack of availability of end-toend QoS, and the effects of possible net neutrality laws.      </p>
      <p align="justify" class="Body"><strong>Service Tier Design</strong></p>
      <p align="justify" class="Body">The initial work is focused on how Internet Service Providers design tier rates, tier prices, and network capacity. Web browsing and video streaming are considered as the two dominant Internet applications. We propose a novel set of utility functions that depend on a user&rsquo;s willingness to pay for each application, the performance of each application, and the time devoted to each application. For a monopoly provider, the demand function for each tier is derived as a function of tier price and performance. We first give conditions for the tier rates, tier prices, and network capacity that maximize Internet Service Provider profit, defined as subscription revenue minus capacity cost. We then show how an Internet Service Provider may simplify tier and capacity design, by allowing their engineering department to set network capacity, their marketing department to set tier prices, and both to jointly set tier rates.</p>

      <p align="justify" class="Body"><strong>Data Caps</strong></p>
      <p align="justify" class="Body">The next work is focused on how ISPs choose data caps and the resulting impact on users. We propose models to analyze the effect of data caps upon Internet subscribers. Novel utility functions that consider the time users devote to Internet applications and the opportunity cost of a user&rsquo;s free time are designed for web browsing and video streaming. A monopoly ISP is presumed to maximize its profit by controlling tier prices, tier rates, data caps and overage charges in a basic tier targeting web browsing service and a premium tier targeting video streaming service. We show how users fall into five<br>
        categories: non-Internet subscribers, basic tier subscribers, premium tier subscribers unaffected by a data cap, premium tier subscribers who are capped but do not choose to exceed the cap, and premium tier subscribers who exceed the cap and pay overage charges. When data caps are used for profit maximization, we find that the monopoly ISP has the incentive to keep the basic tier price and basic tier rate unchanged, to increase the premium tier rate, and to reduce the premium tier price. The ISP also has the incentive to set smaller caps and higher overage charges than when caps are used only to ensure that heavy users pay for their usage. Based on the change in the tiered pricing plan, we give analytical and numerical results to show the change in user tier choice, user surplus and social welfare.</p>
