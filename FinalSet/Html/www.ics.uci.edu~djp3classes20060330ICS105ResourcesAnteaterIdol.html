    <li>Explanation
      <ul>
        <li>In order to conduct a study in user interface design and implementation, 10 teams of students produced Web 2.0 applications with an optional Nokia cell phone component. Each of the teams presented their work in an American Idol style format called &quot;Anteater Idol&quot;. The audience voted on the best applications and the best teams received a small prize for their efforts. The overall best team received an automatic 100% grade. Subsequent studies of the user interface design were conducted in a lab setting. Below is a list of the best presentations in order by their audience vote. They span the range from beautiful to technically proficient to broken :) . Not all projects work in all browsers. </li>
