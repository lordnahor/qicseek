You can access many records for free by going to
your local Mormon (LDS) History Center
or other genealogical research center.

There are many LDS locations in the U.S., Canada, and England,
and quite a few locations in several other countries.
<BR>
You can find locations for your country at a
<a href="https://familysearch.org/locations/centerlocator">Family Search</a>
web page.
<P>
If they do not have a particular microfilm immediately available,
you can make arrangements for them to obtain a loaner
for a small fee that covers their postal costs.
<BR>(A loaner film may require a few weeks to arrive.)
