    <h1>Hints from Weng Ng</h1>

    <p> Dear students, before you start submitting assignments, I would like to
provide some tips (garnered from several quarters of being a TA for this
course) you might find useful for ensuring a good grade on your assignments:

    <p> [1] I will be grading your assignments, so you can be sure the following
points will be highly relevant to your success in this course.

    <p> [2] I have a very low level of tolerance for mechanical errors of English.
There are a few reasons for this:

    <p> (a) All of you should already have had a lower division writing course,
which should have dealt adequately with basic mechanics of English.

    <p> (b) Most mechanical errors can be caught by careful proofreading and
editing. It's really just a matter of putting in some time and effort.

    <p> (c) Such errors prevent me from assessing the content of your work properly.

    <p> I am not expecting a perfect piece of writing, but if your work exhibits a
significant number of mechanical errors, you will be given a very low grade,
regardless of the strength of its content. So please proofread very
thoroughly before submitting your work. If you do not have a strong command
of English, have a friend proofread your work, or approach LARC for help.

    <p> [3] Do not write overly long sentences. If you cram too much information
into one sentence, it becomes hard to read, parse and comprehend. Break long
sentences up into smaller, simpler ones wherever appropriate.

    <p> [4] Do not pad your work. For example, adding lots of redundant words to
sentences, or repeating the same point over and over under different guises.
If you do not have enough material to fill up the requisite number of pages,
most likely you have not researched or thought through the topic
sufficiently before beginning to write. So you need to plan out your writing
a little more; padding it will not solve the problem. I would rather that
you write less than the required number of pages, than ramble on just to
fill up the space.

    <p> [5] Do not write in the same way that you speak. Normal speech tends to
contain many redundant words. If you do not believe me, have a friend record
a sample of you speaking normally and listen to it afterward. Most of the
time this is not a big deal since speech is usually heard in real-time, so
redundant words are not so noticeable. But in writing, redundant words stick
out like sore thumbs, and are very tedious to read. So you should watch out
for this tendency, and aim for tight, focused writing.

    <p> So I hope not to see any of the things I warned against in your work. If you
have further questions feel free to ask me.

    <p> Regards Weng Ng
