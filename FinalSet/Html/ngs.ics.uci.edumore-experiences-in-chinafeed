		<description><![CDATA[Dear Smitha,
Neither I nor you will be here to witness the ultimate and hence what I am interested in, and hopefully you are too, is to see the trajectory in India that points to what you and I hope for.  I wish I and millions of Indian well wishers could feel the same as you say &quot;India is in safe hands&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You don&#039;t worry Mr. Jain. India is in safe hands, and marching ahead confidently, I&#039;m pretty sure the next decade, a much vibrant India would emerge. You got to understand how tough it was for people of China to move to urban areas for prosperity, unlike in India and USA for oppotrunities. Never in history a centrally planned country survived long, I only wish you would be around to witness the ultimate.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your comments.  I consider computer vision to be a component of multimedia and believe that progress in computer vision will not depend more on using context derived from other sources.  ANd that is what I am trying to do.  So I feel that I am still working on Computer Vision.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You are always a diligent observer and thinker. I am glad to find you feel like to write your thoughts down and share them with others.

During this MM09, you must don&#039;t recognize me. But I keep observing you and listening to your talks. Your idears are really thought-provoking, though I don&#039;t do much research on social media. I&#039;ve read your Machine Vision long ago, but am not sure whether you still do research on that. If you do, hope to see your fresh thinkings in that field, as well as in Multimedia.

Best wishes and China always welcome you.]]></description>
