<h2> Lab 4 </h2>
<p>
  The objective of this lab assignment is to design and implement the ALU and design a basic
	data path consisting of a Register File and an ALU.</p>
<p>
  Please read <b>ALL</b> instructions carefully. <b>Only</b> <a href="./index.html#SUBMISSION">properly submitted</a> assignments will be graded. Make sure to create a zip file, named by your student id, and submit required files in it. </p>

<h3>Specification</h3></a>
<p>Your task is to make an Arithmetic Logic Unit(ALU) to execute a subset of MIPS ISA.
<!--There are 3 types of instructions in MIPS ISA. The format is described in the following table:</br>
<table border = 1><tr>
<th>Type</th>
<th colspan="6">-31- &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; format (bits) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -0-</th>

</tr>
<tr align="center">
<td><b>R</b></td>
<td>opcode (6)</td>
<td>rs (5)</td>
<td>rt (5)</td>
<td>rd (5)</td>
<td>shamt (5)</td>
<td>funct (6)</td>
</tr>

<tr align="center">
<td><b>I</b></td>
<td>opcode (6)</td>
<td>rs (5)</td>
<td>rt (5)</td>
<td colspan="3">immediate (16)</td>
</tr>
<tr align="center">
<td><b>J</b></td>
<td>opcode (6)</td>

<td colspan="5">address (26)</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
The instructions this ALU executes are R (register) type only. The I (immediate) type instructions are used to handle immediate operands in an instruction, and J type are used to handle up to 26-bit offset in (unconditional) jump instructions.</p>
<p>For R-type instruction, we have the following fields:<br>
opcode: operation code
rs: source register<br>
rt: source or destination register<br>
rd: destination register<br>
shamt: shift amount (you will ignore this field and always use shamt = "00001")<br>
funct: function (provide more information in addition to opcode, you will ignore this field and always use funct="000000")
</p>

</p><p> The instructions this ALU executes include:

<br>
* For SLL and SRL, you will only implement shifts by 1 bit. You can ignore
situations when C != 1.</p><p>To
support the above instructions, we use data, control and status ports
to interface with the ALU. You are required to use 3 data ports: 2 for
input (<b><i>A</i></b> and <b><i>B</i></b>) 1 for output(<b><i>C</i></b>). All 3 data ports are 32 bits wide.</p>
<p>Use control ports <em><strong>func</strong></em> for operation selection. For example, if
ALU Control is set to "000", then do addition.</p>
<p>In addition to these ports, your ALU needs to use a <i><b>zero</b></i> status signal to represent the situation when
computation result is 0. </p>

<p>The basic data path contains the register file designed in lab 2 and
the ALU. To coordinate the data communication, 3 more registers are
added to the data path. Register A is between register file d_out_1 and
ALU input A. Register B is between register file d_out_2 and ALU input
B. Register ALUout is used to store the output of ALU. All these
registers are synchronized with the global clock signal, so is the
register file.
</p><p>You are required to submit, in the specification, the following diagrams:<br>1.Block
diagram showing the internal logic of an 8-bit ALU. Show the details of
bit 0, 1, ... 6, 7 and use "..." to represent the ones in the middle.
You can use the following basic
components in your schematic: logic gates (AND, OR, XOR, NOT, NOR),
full adder, decoder and MUX. You need to come up with some logic to
implement both ADD and
SUB using the same full-adder (Hint: think about 2's compliment).<br>
2. the block diagram of your data path. Name the signals properly.<br>
Please pay attention to signal width. Don't forget to mark them!</p>


<h3>Design</h3>
<p>
Your task is to design the ALU module and assenble the datapath. </p>
<p>The <a href="./lab4.zip">template VHDL files</a> for both module
(ALU.vhd and datapath.vhd) and the testbench (ALU_tb.vhd and
datapath_tb.vhd) have been provided to you. The interface (that is,
ports) is already defined. You need to add code for functionality in
both files to make them work. Do not make any change to the interface. </p>
<p>
The first part of this lab is to design the ALU.<br>
-You should put the entire ALU into a process.<br>
-Use case statement to select different operations.<br>
-You can use packages discussed in class.</p>
<p>
The second part of this lab is to design the datapath.<br>
-In your top level design, declare components for Register file and ALU and add the registers A,B,and ALUout.<br>- <a href="lab4_dp.jpg" target="_blank">Click here</a> for a reference datapath design.</p><p></p>
<!--
<p>
The last part of this lab is to synthesize your datapath design in Quartus II, and simulate your design at gate level. Further instructions will be given during discussion.</p>
!-->
<h3>Verification</h3>
<p>In your ALU test bench, you need to test your ALU module for each operation with a few random inputs.</p>
<p>In your datapath test bench, you need to build a test case that
writes some values in to the register file and executes some
computation with the data in the register file. Pay attention to
clocking.</p>
