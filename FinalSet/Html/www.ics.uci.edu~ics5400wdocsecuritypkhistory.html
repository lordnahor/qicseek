<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a> reported
on the expiration of two landmark patents which laid the
foundation for public-key cryptography.
<p>
Just a few months later (24 December 1997), there was another
article, reporting that public-key encryption was discovered
even earlier than the work of those who received the just expired
patent.

NY Times: September 6, 1997
A Patent Falls, and the Internet Dances
By Peter Wayner
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/week/090697patent.html">http://www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/week/090697patent.html</a>
      
When tyrants die, the people parade with the head on a stick; when
loved ones pass on in Ireland, the families celebrate a life
well-lived; but when patents expire, they often slip away into the
night.

From the beginning, though, patent 4,200,770 was different. This
Saturday night a group of computer scientists, Internet fanatics and
Beltway politicos will gather in Washington, D.C.; Silicon Valley; and
Boston to celebrate the end of the patent granted to Whitfield Diffie
and Martin Hellman for a way to encrypt data.

The party will toast the beginning of the end of an era when some of
the greatest techniques for encrypting information were controlled by a
few pivotal companies. The science of secret codes is proving to be
essential technology for securing the Internet, and the techniques
developed by Diffie and Hellman are some of the most useful. Banks use
them to protect their money, companies use them to defend against
industrial espionage and parents use them to protect their children
against pedophiles and pornographers trolling the Internet.

The patent granted to Diffie and Hellman is the first of a group that
emerged from scientists at Stanford University and the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology during the end of the 1970's.  On October 6,
patent 4,218,582 will expire. It was granted to Hellman and Ralph
Merkle, another graduate student at the time, for a public key
encryption system that was later broken. The most famous patent,
however, was probably the one given to Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Len
Adleman, who were all at MIT at the time. It will last until September
20, 2000.

In the past, anyone who wanted to use the most famous encryption
algorithms would need to negotiate licenses with either [6]RSA Data
Security or [7]Cylink, the two companies that controlled the major
patents. The companies were relatively open with their licenses and RSA
Data Security even published general terms.

But many scientists, programmers and tinkers still felt that all of the
legal paperwork and money hampered their ability to add encryption to
software. Many critics openly questioned the basis for the patents and
some even wondered whether it was part of a larger government plot to
suppress the technology.

To make matters worse, it was difficult to determine just how much
value encryption added to a product. For instance, consider a neat
electronic mail program with the ability to encrypt messages. If
someone pays $40 for it, is $20 being spent on the encrypting
capability? Or is $10 a closer number? This made it necessary to engage
in complex negotiations to settle royalties for the patents, adding
more confusion and friction to the mix.

All of that anger and animosity, however, should start to expire with
the first patent on Saturday.

"If there's a sudden blossoming, then the critics will be right that
the patenting held up the technology." Hellman said in a telephone
interview on Thursday. "But there are other factors there. The export
restrictions. The slow standard (development) process."

The [8]National Institute of Standards and Technology is still debating
whether to work on a public-key encryption standard and it has only
recognized a very limited system for creating digital signatures.

The party in Washington may lead to this blossoming. It is being
sponsored by the capital area branch of the [9]Cypherpunks, a loosely
knit organization defined, for the most part, by people who subscribe
to a mailing list. The group has no formal membership, but many
subscribers, to judge from the content of the discussion, are opposed
to letting the government gain access to people's private
correspondence. Many toss about phrases like "You'll get my key when
you pry it from my cold, dead hands." or "When encryption is outlawed,
only outlaws will have encryption."

Many members of the group recognize that public policy on the Internet
is not defined by talking, but by distributing software.  Governmental
policy analysts like Vannevar Bush were dreaming of the World Wide Web
in the 1950s, but the reality began when the first browsers like Mosaic
started appearing.

The Cypherpunks have determined to write the software that will make
encryption more ubiquitous. One early effort by Phil Zimmerman, of
[10]Pretty Good Privacy, has already launched a commercial effort
backed by venture capital. The first half of the party will be aimed at
creating more pioneering software.

The technical excitement is being shared by the former patent owners,
who have very little choice but to be gracious. Jim Omura is the chief
technical officer and one of the founders of Cylink, the company that
bought control of the patent from Stanford. "Now, it's free and
available to everyone," he said in a phone interview, adding that his
company would work with many to encourage open use of the algorithm in
standards. Cylink is already licensing some source code that uses the
technology to companies like Sun.

The end of the animosity also allows everyone to relax and praise the
contributions without fear of compromising a legal position.  Patents
are only granted to new and noteworthy contributions, and "obvious"
improvements are not eligible. The definition of what is "obvious"
however, is open to interpretation and often settled only by endless
litigation. Competitors will often denigrate another's invention to
weaken the patent. The end of the patent, however, leads to a dtente.

By everyone's estimation, the invention by Diffie and Hellman was a
pivotal moment in network security, a crucial component of public
privacy, and also an elegant and simple mathematical solution.

In essence, Diffie and Hellman developed a way for two people to set up
a secure communication channel without ever meeting.  Encryption was
well-understood at the time, but no one had a very good idea of how to
handle the keys that are used to keep the data secret. The keys are
long numbers that act to scramble the data.  Anyone with a copy of the
key can read the data, but the message remains secret to those without
a copy.

Before the invention, people had to either agree to a key in advance or
have some trusted courier carry a copy between them.  Today, banks
still have this problem distributing PIN numbers to the people who use
their ATMs. The banks send the cards and the PIN numbers in different
envelopes to minimize the possibility that someone could steal both.

Diffie and Hellman found a way to use fairly simple arithmetic with big
numbers to let two people agree upon a key. The crucial detail was that
anyone eavesdropping on the conversation would not be able to pick up a
copy of the key by listening to the negotiation.

Diffie believes that he never would have developed public key
cryptography if he hadn't had an anti-authoritarian view. "In 1965
someone mistakenly told me that NSA ([11]National Security Agency)
encrypted the phones in their own building." he said. "I tried to think
how it could work but I never understood classical 'trusted third
party' key distribution. My view of cryptography was that it freed you
from having to trust anyone other than the people you were
communicating with."

The NSA and other cryptographers used more centralized key distribution
systems that, like Caesar's wife, needed to be above suspicion. Each
person would have a single key he shared with the central repository.
That is, there would be a secure channel between the central repository
and each person.

When Alice and Bob, for example, wanted to set up a secure link, both
would ask the central system for a new key they could use to encrypt
their conversation. The new key would be mailed to both hidden by the
two channels. The central key repository was an unavoidable part of the
system before their invention.

Their approach is simple enough to explain in two paragraphs that can
be skipped by the math-averse:

To find a key, Alice chooses a random number "a" and Bob chooses a
random number "b." They also agree on some value of "g" in advance.
Alice ships g^a [that is, g raised to the power a, as in
2^3=8] to Bob and Bob ships g^b to Alice. Alice computes
(g^b)^a and Bob computes (g^a)^b. These are equal according to 
the basic rules of algebra and they can serve as the key.

The system can't be broken because the arithmetic occurs in a "finite
field." That is, after each arithmetic operation, the result is divided
by some prime number, "p," and only the remainder is kept. This is
often indicated by appending "mod p" to the equation. Surprisingly, all
of the basic rules of arithmetic and algebra still apply. Some
operations, however, are harder. No one knows an efficient way to take
g and g^a and find a. This is known as taking the "discrete log," and
the fact that no one has described an easy way to do it means that the
link is secure. No eavesdropper can listen in and take apart the (g^a)
or the (g^b) to discover a or b.

The invention was the culmination of a strong working relationship that
began in September 1974. Before that, Diffie had been traveling the
country with his wife, Mary, discussing cryptography with anyone who
was available. At the time, there was very little published material
about modern methods and much was classified.  Very few people were
interested in the topic and Hellman even says that many of his
colleagues felt that it was "born classified," like secrets about the
atomic bomb, because it was so important to national security.

That September, Diffie made a half-hour appointment with Hellman.  "I
gave Mary the car and went off to see Marty," he recalled. "Each of us
found the other the best informed person he'd met who was willing to
talk. After an hour or so Mary came back and Marty invited us over for
dinner. It turned out that both his wife and Mary were big dog
aficionados. We all got along wonderfully and talked 'till nearly
midnight."

Diffie and Hellman began holding weekly seminars to discuss problems
and possible solutions. While Diffie was technically a graduate student
at the time, both he and his nominal adviser, Hellman, both agree that
this was more a convenient classification that made it easier for
Hellman to use research money to provide support. Diffie never
graduated with a Ph.D., but later was awarded an honorary doctorate by
the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology.  (He also never graduated
from high school.)

Soon after, Ralph Merkle arrived as a graduate student and started
working on cryptography. Merkle would later invent a full public-key
system known as the "knapsack." This approach offered more than just a
way for two people to set up a secure channel, it provided a way for
digital signatures to be created. Patent 4,218,582 covered that
invention, but its value was short-lived.  Adi Shamir, the S in the
rival RSA system, found a way to break it.

Peter Blattman, a Berkeley graduate student, told Diffie that Ralph
Merkle was trying to solve the problem of communicating securely with
someone you had never had any contact with before. "I persuaded him it
couldn't be done," Diffie said with a grin, "but then I went back to
thinking about the problem. I didn't learn anything about Merkle's
approach, but without that conversation, I probably never would have
made my discovery."

In the meantime, Hellman recalls asking colleagues for suggestions of
mathematical equations that were easy to compute, but hard to work
backward. Several gave him ideas, but John Gill, a mathematics
professor at the University of California at Berkeley, pointed him
toward computing exponents in finite fields. "We really owed this to
John Gill," he said.

During this development period, Hellman and Diffie traveled and
occasionally gave talks. This disclosure hurt their position in the
patenting process. Foreign patents, for instance, must be filed before
any public discussion. In the United States, the application must be
made within one year of disclosure. As a result, their patent only held
in the United States and many people probed the history of the talks
looking to invalidate the patents. Patent law has never been clear on
what constitutes disclosure.

There were other legal controversies. In 1977, people weren't even sure
that it was possible to get a patent for software because patents were
only granted for mechanisms, not the laws of nature that presumably
included the mathematics at the core of their claims. The lawyers for
Stanford University, where Hellman was a professor and Diffie a
graduate student, sidestepped this approach by patenting a circuit.
This move, while still debated, is common today.

In the end, the patents never brought much money to either Stanford or
the inventors. Diffie says that his total royalties are about $10,000.
MIT did much better with the RSA patent. Over the last decade, RSA Data
Security, the sole license holder of that patent, returned so much
money to MIT that the university is naming a chair after the company.
One person in the company places the amount at about $10 million, but
concedes that some of this came from the appreciation of the equity the
university held in the company.

Still, this doesn't inflame Diffie. "The reason is that I haven't made
much off of royalties, but I have made a lot off the invention." he
said. "I owe it good jobs over 20 years that's more than a million
dollars."

He is currently holds the title of Distinguished Engineer at Sun
Microsystems.

NY Times: December 24, 1997
British Document Outlines Early Encryption Discovery
By Peter Wayner
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/week/122497encrypt.html">http://www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/week/122497encrypt.html</a>

To the list of institutions that Tony Blair's Labor Party is shaking
up, add the British Secret Service. Last week, the British government's
eavesdropping organization known as the Government Communications
Headquarters, or GCHQ, posted a [5]document to its Web site describing
its role in the discovery of public key cryptography.

The set of algorithms, equations and arcane mathematics that make up
public key cryptography are a crucial technology for preserving
computer privacy in and making commerce possible on the Internet.  Some
hail its discovery as one of the most important accomplishments of
20th-century mathematics because it allows two people to set up a
secure phone call without meeting beforehand.  Without it, there would
be no privacy in cyberspace.

The move by the once dusty and secretive organization is clearly an
attempt to recast its image as a pioneering leader of cyberspace.

For the last 20 years, the public gave credit for the discovery to
Martin Hellman, a professor at Stanford University, and two graduate
students who worked with him at the time, Ralph Merkle and Whitfield
Diffie. They started publishing their work in 1976.

Three professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology at the
time, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Len Adleman soon followed with another
similar approach known by their initials, RSA, which went on to become
one of the dominant solutions used on the Internet.

Before public key cryptography, anyone who wanted to use a secret code
needed to arrange for both sides to have a copy of the key used to
scramble the data, a problem that requires either trusted couriers or
advance meetings. PKC, as it is sometimes known, erased this problem by
making it possible for two people, or more properly their computers, to
agree upon a key by performing some complicated mathematics. There is
no publicly known way for an eavesdropper to pick up the key by
listening in.

The new document details how three employees of the British government
discovered the same approach several years earlier, but kept it a
secret for reasons of national security. A spokesman for the British
government's GCHQ, said that the document's release is part of a
"pan-governmental drive for openness" pushed by the Labor party.

The document describing the steps of invention taken by the spies was
written by James Ellis, a mathematician and cryptographer who died less
than a month ago. In it, Ellis describes how he suggested the existence
of what he called "non-secret encryption" in 1970s.

Ellis says that Clifford Cocks followed with a more practical solution
in 1973 that was essentially the same thing as the algorithm published
by Rivest, Shamir and Adleman. The paper also says that Malcolm
Williamson discovered an algorithm in 1974 that was very similar to the
work of Diffie and Hellman. They did not replicate the work done by
Merkle and Hellman.

In a telephone interview from his office in La Jolla, Calif., Malcolm
Williamson said that he felt bad when others discovered the solution,
but concluded, "I was working at the British government and that's just
one of the restrictions you work under when you work for the
government."

Hellman said in a telephone interview that he agrees. "It must be
really difficult for them to watch other people get the credit," he
said. "But that's the agreement they made when they agreed to work in
secret." He was also quick to point out that the secret branches of the
government have the help of large budgets and classified knowledge.

"Diffie, I and Merkle were working in a vacuum." he said. "If we had
access to all of the classified literature of the previous 30 years, it
would really be an advantage."

For his part, Diffie said in a telephone interview from Cirencester,
England, that he thinks that GCHQ never realized the deep importance of
what the mathematicians discovered. He said that he met James Ellis
several years ago and "within an hour of meeting me, Ellis said, 'You
did much more with this than we did.'"

Diffie also suggested that the history of ideas is hard to write
because many people often find solutions to different problems only to
later determine they've discovered the same thing.

The story keeps going farther back. Recently, Matt Blaze, a
cryptographer employed at Bell Labs, got a copy of a [8]memorandum from
the desk of John F. Kennedy about the problem of securing nuclear
weapons with launch codes. Steve Bellovin, a colleague of Blaze's at
Bell Labs, said: "When I read this memo, I don't see anything that
would require public key cryptography. But I think they're in the
neighborhood. For so many things, the answer is the easy part. Asking
the question is the hard part. I think this got them asking the
questions."

Historians of science will certainly spend time sorting out the various
claims. David Kahn, the author of the best selling history The
Codebreakers, said that he recently asked the National Security Agency
to declassify some documents so he could write the proper history of
public key cryptography. He said an NSA staff member told him, "I've
spoken to the guys who did this, but they don't want to be interviewed
now." This suggests that the NSA also may have discovered public-key
systems or had a hand in exploring them.  Kahn hopes that the NSA will
follow in Britain's lead so an accurate history can be written.

Jim Bidzos, the chief executive of RSA Data Security, the division of
the publicly traded Security Dynamics that holds the patent on the RSA,
said that the announcement in Britain will have no effect on the
company's business. Patent law is based on the notion that the
inventors trade knowledge about the invention in return for an
exclusive license to practice it.

In fact, it is an interesting question to wonder whether Britain could
have changed the history of cyberspace by disclosing the invention and
encouraging the development of widespread cryptographic security for
the public.

This may have been a wise move during the height of the cold war in the
70's when there were thousands of Soviet tanks poised on the edge of
western Europe. Williamson also hastens to note that mathematical
equations weren't considered patentable in Britain at the time and
without a patent anyone could have used the invention.  The RSA patent
in the United States was one of the first and it is generally accepted
to have expanded the definition.

Others are pushing a similar question. In a debate on cryptography
policy at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, John Gilmore,
one of the founders of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the NSA
should be more open. While national defense is very valuable, he
suggested that the need for security in cyberspace for all citizens is
going to be essential in the future.

In the long run, the history of the discovery of public key
cryptography is certain to be written and rewritten often in the next
several years as more documents emerge from secret government
laboratories. The spokesman from GCHQ promises that more documents are
on the way.

Hellman is philosophical. "In a way, these things are like gold nuggets
that God left in the forest." he said. "If I'm walking along in the
forest and I stubbed my toe on it, who's to say I deserve credit for
discovering it?"

He is quick to point out, however, that he shared the discovery with
everyone.
