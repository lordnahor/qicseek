		<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t you think that a wiki novel will miss the symbolism that some novels are so rich in? I recently saw a movie called Apocalypse now. Would it have been possible to portray the ideas in the same class if this was a wiki-movie or even a wiki novel?? I don&#039;t feel so... Maybe the wikis are good for facts, fiction, humour, adventure etc.. but i doubt them being able to produce high class material like Lord Of The Rings, The Godfather.. Or would this be possible one day? :)]]></description>
