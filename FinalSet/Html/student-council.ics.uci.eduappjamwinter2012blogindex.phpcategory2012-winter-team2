<span class="submitted">March 6, 2012 &#8212; Team2 </span>

<div class="content">
<p>Current Status:<br />
The app is complete! Final changes to the code were made at around 10:30pm. The remaining time was spent exporting and testing the app on the android, and cleaning up the document and presentation slides to submit. Submitted just in time.</p>
<p>Progress Today:<br />
At the beginning of the day, the app had most of it&#8217;s features complete, but still a lot of bugs and implementation issues. Since we didn&#8217;t have much time yesterday to work and I knew that the bug fixing would take a lot of time, I started coding at 12:00am today, and continued until around 8 or 9 in the mourning before taking a nap. By then the app was looking much more polished and I had implemented some extra features we had been hoping for. Our team met at 11:00 today and went over the changes. We then continued with some of us fixing bugs and adding new features, while the others worked on populating our database and creating the documents. By 10:30pm we had gotten the fixes and features we wanted to, so we stopped coding and prepared to submit.</p>
<p>Challenges:<br />
Very tired from programming for so many hours. Ran into some unexpected bugs in the webserver that made things take longer than we had originally thought. However, we worked hard and were able to finish on time.</p>

<p><strong>Current Status:</strong><br />
All major features have been implemented. The app has been tested on the android and works. There are still some bugs that need to be fixed, and we need to work on our presentation.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Today:</strong><br />
Our team was unable to meet up today, so it was an individual work day. Most of our work today was testing the app to find bugs, fixing bugs, and adding data to the database. We also tested the app on the android again and were able to get it working the same as in the emulator.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong><br />
There are still some bugs we need to fix before the deadline. There was also some difficulty getting the app to work on the android due to the google maps api and using the right keystore. However, we were able to get it working on a phone and have a better idea of how much work remains.</p>

<p>Current Status:<br />
All major features have been implemented and are in a mostly working condition. We also were able to find time to add Google Maps to our app. We also started adding icons to make the app look more exciting. However we still have a lot of work to do: fix bugs, test the app more, clean up some UI issues, and prepare for our presentation.</p>
<p>Progress Today:<br />
We met today at 11am on campus and worked until 11pm. We split up into two groups: one group finishing up current features and fixing bugs, the other attempting to integrate the Google Maps API. After both groups were at a good stopping point, we used Mercurial to merge all our projects into one and spend the rest of the night patching it together.</p>
<p>Challenges:<br />
Our main challenge today was patching together a lot of separate pieces of code. There were also a lot of server side changes that had to be made to implement some of the features we had put in the UI. We also had some trouble getting Google Maps to work on everyone&#8217;s computer. However, we were dedicated enough to spend another full day working on it so we could work through these problems.</p>

<div class="content">
<p><strong>Current Status:</strong><br />
Most of the basic features of the app are now finished or almost finished. All that&#8217;s left is to make certain parts of the app connect to the database, for which most of the functionality is there. We should be able to finish most of the necessary features within a few hours tomorrow, after which we&#8217;ll spend time testing the code and refining the features. After that, we will prepare for the presentation. If we have time, we want to try integrating Google Maps into our app.<br />
<strong><br />
Progress Today:</strong><br />
We met today at 11:30am on campus and worked until 10:00pm. We spent a lot of time getting things on the server side to work. We also finished most of the UI for the app. At the end of the day we borrowed a friend&#8217;s phone and tested the app and it worked fine.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong><br />
We had some more problems with bugs. Most of the team had essays that they needed to finish by midnight today, which hampered productivity. We were getting pretty tired by the end of the day because we had been working continuously since early in the morning (for us). We had problems with merging code in Mercurial, which we were able to eventually fix.</p>

<p><strong>Current Project Status:</strong><br />
Most of the code for the main features of the app is now written. Since we have been able to get most of the basic features in, we hope to finish the basic features on Friday and use Saturday to make some extra features that would benefit the app.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Today:</strong><br />
Today we met at 10:00am on campus and spent most of our time finishing most of the parts we split up on Wednesday to work on. As we finished sections of the code we took on more features, and we ended the day by merging all our code into one project through Mercurial&#8217;s update tools.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong><br />
We ran into a few more bugs, but were able to figure them all out by the end of the day. One of the major challenges for today was to merge our code into one project, but Mercurial helped us to complete the process smoothly.</p>

<span class="submitted">February 29, 2012 &#8212; Team2 </span>

<div class="content">
<p><strong>Current Status:</strong><br />
We have created most of the underlying framework for our app and done a bit of work on the UI. Our app idea is pretty much fully fleshed out, we just need to finish coding it. We hope to finish most of the primary functions of the app by the end of day 4 so we can use days 5 and 6 for cleaning it up, making it look good, and making sure everything works right.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Today:</strong><br />
We met today at 11:00 on campus. Our first steps for today were to solidify our ideas for the app, and get a basic framework and setup ready for everyone to work on. Then we split up to work on three separate tasks that would be needed for the app to function: a major UI element to be implemented in several places, a way to store app data on the phone, and a way to communicate with the database. Each of these tasks encountered problems, but we were able to come up with solutions and get a significant portion of each of these features done before finally calling it a night and each going off to work on our own to finish things up. Tomorrow we will meet again to combine these features and create a UI that utilizes them.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong><br />
One of our challenges today was figuring out how best to split up the work. After making a decision on that, we ran into several problems, mostly due to the fact that we are learning how to use the android platform as we work with it. For a while we couldn&#8217;t communicate with our webserver, were unable to use the files we saved on the phone, and were having trouble switching between UI screens in the app. Also, one of our members was having trouble getting the app to run on his computer. However, we were able to fix each of these issues by the end of the day, and are making good progress.</p>

<p>Current Project Status:<br />
We have come up with and decided on the final idea for our app. We have begun laying out the foundations and design specs for the app.</p>
<p>Progress Today:<br />
Today we met on campus at 11:00am to decide on our final idea for the app and begin work. We started by discussing each of the ideas we had come up with, and checking the Android Market to see if there were already similar apps out there. In the end we made our decision and went with the idea we were not able to find on the marketplace. We then began to flesh out the idea and talk about the different screens the app would require. In the end we decided on a tabbed interface with 5 screens to switch between. After that we familiarized everyone with how to use Mercurial, our version control system. We then made our starter project in Eclipse and uploaded it to our repository. Finally, we decided to each go learn more about developing for Android and then meet again tomorrow at the same time.</p>
<p>Challenges:<br />
Only one member of our team has any experience working with Android, and not much at that. We decided to go over the android workshops and learn more so that tomorrow we would be better prepared to code our app. We also decided we will be needing the MySQL database, so we need to get familiar with that and how to communicate with it.</p>
