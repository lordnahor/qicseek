		<description><![CDATA[Text is a very efficient medium of communicating information. It can be easily copied, reprinted, SMSed, tweeted, stored, indexed, etc. 

I cannot help wonder, however, if our heavy reliance on (and abuse of) text has indeed precluded us from exploiting other mediums of communication, to the point that we might have become handicapped. I often find myself without words to explain my experience with certain pieces of art--granted that I am not a native English speaker, who is gradually loosing fluency in his own native language. Moreover, sometimes the best way to express such experiences is the audio-visual art itself (be it a photo of a sunset, a video, or a painting or a piece of ballet).  

Maybe the time has finally come to reclaim our audio-visual communication skills. Mapping concepts to audio-visual representations rather than (or only) to text might give us a much more powerful language. And a more available one, since there is no need to learn technical language to express concepts we already know (we just don&#039;t know how to write them textually). Consider also the potential of audio-visual languages for international conversations. In these lines,  the new iPhone operating system (iOS), for instance, already includes a new international keyboard based on emojicons/emoticons. Indeed very interesting times :-) ....]]></description>
