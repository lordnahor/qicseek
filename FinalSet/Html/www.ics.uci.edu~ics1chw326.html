<LI><A NAME="QQ1"><B>What are the requirements for a masters in Management?
</B></A><br>
<P> A couple of years ago, I was sitting around one day wondering about 
what I want to do in the future.  So after deciding not to pursue
a future in Engineering, I figured the Buisness market was the way I 
wanted to go.  Now the question was <I>how?</I>.</P>
<P>I decided the easiest way was to Major in Economics, 
Minor in Management and try to get a MBA after I graduated.  
The <A HREF="http://www.socsci.uci.edu"> Social Sciences 
Dept.</A> at UCI was very helpful, but I still needed some 
inofrmation on how to get my MBA.  While searching the Web I 
found a wonderful home page through the Univ. of Texas.  The 
<A HREF="http://mundo.eco.utexas.edu/Economics/Handbook/l-grad.sch.html"> Graduate School</A>    
home page allowed me to find some helpful information.  Such 
as the basic five factors that will help me enter good 
Graduate school.</P>
The five factors are:
<OL>
<B><LI>GPA</LI><LI>Test scores on the LSAT, GMAT, or GRE</LI> 
<LI>Recommendation letters</LI><LI>Extracurricular activities</LI>
<LI>Work experience</LI></B></OL>

<P>Out of these five factors I have found out that Work 
Experience tends to be one of the most important factors 
which Grad schools look at.  I was also able to find other important 
helpful, information through the home page.  Like me if you just click on 
Graduate School you can find out more information.</P>

<P><LI><A NAME="QQ2"><B>What upper division classes are required for an 
Economics major?</B></A><br></P>
<P>Before I can get my MBA, I have to make sure I graduate from UCI with 
all the required requirements completed.  In order to gradute with an 
Econmics major, besides the breath requirements one must complete all 
lower division and upper division Economic courses with passing grades.</P>
<P>The easiest way to find information on courses without speaking to the 
staff.  Would be to look at the <A 
HREF="gopher://uniedit.cwis.uci.edu:7026/00/new.cat/ss/econ">Dept. of 
Econ. Course Catalog.</A>  I was able to find out that along with Econ 
100A-B-C it is required that one must complete four additional 
upper-division courses of their choice.  The four courses can be chosen 
from different catagories ranging from Quantitative Methods to Financial 
Economics.</P>
<P>The only problem now is when should I take them and when are they 
offered?  This question is not to hard to answer, because all that I have 
to do is look at the appopriate <A 
HREF="gopher://ka.reg.uci.edu/11/ro/soc">Scedule of Classes</A> catalog.

<P><LI><A NAME="QQ3"><B>How can multimedia enhance computers?
</B></A><br></P>
<P>Multimedia is the use of graphics, sound, animation and video with the 
use of computers.  The addition of multimedia to computers helps people 
search the web with a whole new experience.  The idea of multimedia not 
only enhances a users experience, but opens up new paths to view.</P>
<P>The new paths which appear, allow someone to access such things as: <A 
HREF="http://akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo/Computers/Multimedia/Pictures/"> 
various graphical pictures</A>, <A 
HREF="http://tns-www.lcs.mit.edu/vs/demos.html">video files</A>, <A 
HREF="http://tns-www.lcs.mit.edu/cgi-bin/sports/nba/highlights"> and even 
NBA sports highlights.</A>  The use of multimedia allows a broader use of 
computers from schools as a learning experience to businesses as a tool 
to compete in a competitive market.  So no matter who you are multimedia 
will help to enhance your experience with computers.</P> 

<p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></A></P>

<P><LI><A NAME="QQ4"><B>How important is the WWW for me?</B></A><br></P>
<P>The WWW plays an important role in the life of many people, including 
me. Without the web today it would be very difficult for people to find 
certain information.  But with the advancement of the Information 
Super-Highway and the WWW I can acess information quicker than ever(and 
its easy too).  As stated above multimedia has played a big part in the 
advancement of commputers, allowing one to view their documents and 
information with graphics and sound.</P>
<P>I believe without me taking <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/"> 
ICS 1C</A>, I would never have learned so much about the web and it's 
features.  With my new found knowledge I can now access various 
information through such servers as:  <A 
HREF="http://akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo/"> 
Yahoo-A Guide to WWW</A> and the <A HREF="http://galaxy.einet.net/"> 
ElNet Galaxy.</A> Thus I would say that the WWW is very important to 
me!</P>

<P><LI><A NAME="QQ5"><B>What can I do at Club Med?</B></A><br></P>
<P>Club Med is one of today's hottest Vacation Resorts located through many 
tropical areas of the world.  Whenever I thought of Club Med, I pictured 
a resort for adults only.  But <A 
HREF="http://www.clubmed.com/Ads/Clubmed/index.html">Club Med</A> is a 
universal resort.  Whether you are young or old, married  or single, Club 
Med can be for you.   Club Med features different types of villages such 
as friendship, romance, and togetherness.</P>
<P>The <A HREF="http://www.clubmed.com/Ads/Clubmed/philosophy.html"> Club Med 
philosophy</A> is to give someone "endless amount of options" and they 
will be able to create their own perfect vacation.  These options range 
from exotic sites to dream rooms to vast <A 
HREF="http://www.clubmed.com/Ads/Clubmed/sports.html"> sporting 
activities.</A></P>
<P>So no matter who you are and no matter what you want to do Club Med 
will try to provide you with the oppotunity to just do it.</P>
