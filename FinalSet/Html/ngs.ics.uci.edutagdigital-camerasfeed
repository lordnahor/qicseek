				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pinaki Sinha finished his doctoral dissertation (under my supervision) on automatic summarization of personal photo collections.  As he states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Photo taking and sharing devices (e.g., smart phones, digital cameras, etc) have become<br />
extremely popular in recent times. Photo enthusiasts today capture moments of their personal<br />
lives using these devices. This has resulted in huge collections of photos stored in<br />
various personal archives. The exponential growth of online social networks and web based<br />
photo sharing platforms have added fuel to this fire. According to recent estimates [46],<br />
three billion photos are uploaded on the social network Facebook per month. This photo<br />
data overload has created some major challenges. One of the them is automatic generation<br />
of representative overviews from large photo collections. Manual browsing of photo<br />
corpora is not only tedious, but also time inefficient. Hence, development of an automatic<br />
photo summarization system is not only a research but also a practical challenge. In this<br />
dissertation, we present a principled approach for generation of size constrained overview<br />
summaries from large personal photo collections.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Considering the importance of the problem created by advances in photo related technology, this dissertation addresses<br />
and makes good progress towards solving an important problem for many people.  Very good dissertation.<br />
Congratulations, Pinaki, for a job well-done.</p>
