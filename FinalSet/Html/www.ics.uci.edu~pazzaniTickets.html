<h1>Taking Tickets</h1>
<h2>by Eric Torgerson.</h2>

A woman in her forties, dressed wealthy,
stands by the door for a while and then
says, I guess you couldn't let me in for just
twenty minutes, could you, I guess I shouldn't
even ask, it's just that I'm leaving in twenty
minutes and I'd like to go in, it seems a shame to
get a ticket for twenty minutes, it wouldn't be
right for you to let me in though, would it, that's
right, I'm sorry, I shouldn't even ask.... She
walks away fast.<p>

I like her, she tells the truth and she doesn't want
anything free. <p>

A girl in shorts and halter top, barefoot, pretty,
stands by the door for a while--they all start
wrong that way, standing a while without talking
to get up their nerve -- then tells me she's been
waiting for weeks, looking forward, her friends are
inside, a bummer, could she just sneak in? I give
her my smile of apology, gee, I feel bad, I'm just
here taking tickets, after all.... She knows how
I feel, her friends, looking forward, a bummer,
oh well. She says have a good day.<p>

I like her too, she's nice. If I like you I won't let
you in without a ticket.<p>

There's never a problem with your friends, they
always have tickets, and they've got them out
before you have to ask.<p>

A guy who worked here, inside, but he quit or
they fired him, he walks up and starts to small
talk, nice day, good crowd? I give him short
answers, I know what he wants. He never looks
straight at me once, just questions, how's Bob, did
Annette have her baby yet. He doesn't want to
have to ask, he wants me to say come on in Ed?
on me? for old times' sake? We were never friends,
I'm going to make him say it. And it takes him so
long, he can think of so many questions. Finally
he asks, he's broke, things are tough, I say go on
in, but no smile, no friendship, just get out of
here. Ten minutes of thank you till I say again go
on in.<p>

Just make me despise you, you can get me to let
you in free. I do it to hurt you.<p>

I don't know why I've stayed at this job for so
long. It's not the right kind of job for someone
like me.<p>

I stay because sometimes somebody just walks
through. They have no ticket and I don't ask,
they don't need one. Not for the obvious reasons:
it's not just beautiful women or old men with
canes. Just people who don't need tickets, who
walk right through. It's like they hypnotize me,
but they don't. It's who they are. I don't ask for
a ticket, I say hi.<p>

The thing I wonder about, the thing that amazes
me, is how do they know they don't need a ticket.
You need tickets here. People cheat and sneak,
but it's not the same thing. What does it feel
like, knowing you don't need a ticket? They never
act like movie stars or the president; more like
they don't know anyone needs a ticket. But they
do know that. They don't act embarrassed, either.<p>

That's what you wait for, taking tickets. Sometimes 
it's months, even years. Then someone walks
through, and it makes you feel good, deep inside,
way down. all the way.<p>
