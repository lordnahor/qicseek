<h1>MinGW C++/Eclipse Download and Installation</h1>

<hr align="left" width="100%">
<p>
<b>Install MinGW and a new version of Eclipse to use with It.</b>
<p>
MinGW means <b>Min</b>imalist <b>G</b>NU for <b>W</b>indows: GNU is a source
  of open source programming tools (GNU stands for GNU is Not Unix).
There are two parts to this handout.
First, you will download the files needed by GNU C++.
Then you will download a version of Eclipse that is already set up to use
  MinGW.
You may want to print these instructions before proceeding, so that you can
  refer to them while downloading and installing MinGW and Eclipse.
Or, just keep this document in your browser.
You should read each step completely before performing the action that it
  describes.

<li>Click the <b>Download mingw-get-setup.exe(86.5 kB)</b>
      link.
    <p>
    This file should start downloading in your standard download folder.

    <p>
    The file should appear as

    <p>
    Terminate the window browsing the SourceForge web site.

    <p>
    <img src="images/10close.jpg">
    <p>

        <b>IMPORTANT: Even though you see a highlighted PATH in the User

             part to change it.</b>
    <li>Click <b>Edit...</b>
    <li>Copy <b>C:\MinGW\bin;C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin;</b>
          (include everything from <b>C</b> to <b>;</b>) and then paste
          it at the very start of the <b>Variable Value</b> text entry.
        <p>
        When done it should look like
    <p>

    <p>
    <li>Click <b>OK</b> (3 times)
    </ul>
</ol>
You are now ready to install Eclipse.



<h2>Eclipse: Version 4.3 (Kepler)</h2>
<p>

The Eclipse download requires about 200 MB of disk space; keep it on your
  machine, in case you need to re-install Eclipse.
When installed, Eclipse requires an additional 200 MB of disk space.
<p>

<h3>Downloading</h3>
<ol>
<li>Click
    <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/index.php" target="_blank">
      Eclipse</a><p>
    The following page will appear in your browser.
    In this handout we will download <b>Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers</b> for
      Windows 32 Bit; if your computer uses Windows, continue below; otherwise
        look above the column of "green arrows" for the label
        <b>Eclipse Kepler (4.3) Packages for</b>
        and in the pull-down list to its right, choose either
        <b>Mac OS X (Cocoa)</b> or <b>Linux</b> and then continue below.
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipsedownloadpage.jpg">
    <p>

<p>
<li>Click the <b>32 Bit</b> Operating System for your machine
      (even if you know your Operating System is 64 Bits), under the heading
      <b>Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers</b> (the fifth icon from the top).
    <p>
    You will see the following page (don't worry about the name of the
      institution to the right of the big downward pointing arrow).
    <p>
    <img src="images/mirror.jpg">
     
<p>
<li>Click the big downward pointing arrow underneath the
      <b>Download eclipse-cpp-kepler-SR1-win32.zip from:</b>
    The site named here, in purple to the right of the arrow:
      <b>[United States] OSU Open Source Lab (http)</b> is the
      random one chosen by the download page this time.
    <p>
    This file should start downloading in your standard download folder.
    This file is about 200 Mb so it might take a while to download fully if you
      are on a slow internet connection (it took me about 5 minutes over a
      cable modem).
    Don't worry about the exact time as long as the download continues to make
      steady progress.
    <p>
    The file should appear as
    <p>
    <img src="images/downloadfile.jpg">
    <p>
    Terminate the window browsing the Eclipse download.

<p>
<li>Move this file to a more permanent location, so that you can install Eclipse
      (and reinstall it later, if necessary).
<p>
<li>Start the <b>Installing</b> instructions directly below.
</ol>

<p>
<hr align="left" width="33%">

<h3>Installing</h3>
<ol>
<li>Unzip <b>eclipse-cpp-kepler-SR1-win32.zip from:</b>, the file that you just
     downloaded and moved.
    <br>
    On my machine (running Windows 7), I can
    <ul>
    <li>Right-click the file.
    <li>Hover over the <b>IZArc</b> command from the menu of options.
    <li>Click <b>Extract Here</b>
    </ul>
    <p>
    <img src="images/izarc.jpg">
    <p>
    If you do not have IZArc or an equivalent unzipping program, here is the
      web site to download a free copy of
      <a href="http://izarc.org/download.html" target="_blank">IZarc</a>.
    <p>
    Unzipping this file creates a folder named <b>eclipse</b>.
    You can leave this folder here or move it elsewhere on your hard disk.
    I recommend putting the downloaded file and resulting folder in the
       <b>C:\Program Files\</b> directory.

<p>
<li>Create a shortcut on your desktop to the <b>eclipse.exe</b> file in
      this <b>eclipse</b> folder: <img src="images/eclipse/eclipseexe.jpg">
    <br>
    On most Windows machines, you can
    <ul>
    <li>Right-press the file <b>eclipse.exe</b>
    <li>Drag it to the desktop.
    <li>Release the right button.
    <li>Click <b>Create shortcut here</b>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Now you are ready to perform a <b>one-time only</b> setup of Eclipse on
      your machine.

<p>
<li>Double-click the shortcut to Eclipse that you just created above.
    <p>
    The following splash screen will appear
    <p>
    <img src="images/splash.jpg">
    <p>
    and then a <b>Workspace Launcher</b> pop-up window will appear.
    <p>
    <img src="images/workspacelauncher.jpg">
    <p>
    In the <b>Workspace</b> text box, your login name should appear between
      <b>C:\Users\</b> and <b>\workspace</b>, instead of <b>Administrator</b>.
    <p>
    Leave <b>unchecked</b> the 
      <b>Use this as the default and do not ask again</b> box.
    Although you will use this same workspace for the entire quarter (checking
      projects in and out of it), it is best to see this
      <b>Workspace Launcher</b> pop-up window each time you start Eclipse, to
      remind you where your workspace is located.

<li>Click <b>OK</b>.
    <p>
    Progress bars will appear as Eclipse loads.
    <p>
    Eventually the Eclipse workbench will appear with a <b>Welcome</b> tab
      covering it.
    <p>
    <img src="images/welcome.jpg">

<p>
<li>Terminate (click <b>X</b> on) the <b>Welcome</b> tab.
    <p>
    You will not see the <b>Welcome</b> tab when you start Eclipse after this
      first time.
    You should now see the following Eclipse workbench.
    <p>
    <img src="images/postwelcome.jpg">
    <p>
    Notice the <b>C/C++</b> words/icon appear on the top left (in the Window
      title-bar) and below the upper right-hand corner (beneath the tool-bar).

</ol>
Eclipse is now installed for MinGW.
