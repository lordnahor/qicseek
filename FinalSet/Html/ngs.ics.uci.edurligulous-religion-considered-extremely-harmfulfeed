		<description><![CDATA[I have not seen the movie but I could agree that it must have well disclosed the unknown negative side of the religion &amp; it is a good step.
However I believe that there is a way to find/strive for  positive side of it &amp; implement without forcing others to agree with what we believe.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I saw Religulous and was surprised at how funny it was. We laughed quite a bit. The editing is great and it was good to see a movie show how brainless religion makes people. None of the religious people liked being questioned. It made them defensive and angry, or they just pooh-poohed reason and science completely. I&#039;ve never been a big fan of Bill Maher, but I agree with the premise of his movie. It&#039;s interesting to contrast that with Ben Stein&#039;s movie, Expelled, which makes Darwinism responsible for Bolshevism and the Holocaust. I guess religious people will tell any lie to make themselves look better than they are.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The issue I had with this movie was that Maher isnâ€™t interested in answers. Religulous is a profane, condescending, and often funny rant against religion -- Christianity especially, but also Judaism, Mormonism, and Islam. 

But Maherâ€™s mocking documentary promotes the idea that only oddballs, cranks, and nincompoops can take religion seriously. Thatâ€™s a fairly easy case to make if you focus, as Maherâ€™s interviews mostly do, on oddballs, cranks, and nincompoops: the Puerto Rican cult leader who claims to be the Antichrist, the pothead in Amsterdam with his marijuana â€œministry,â€ the misfit rabbi who embraces Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the young-earth creationist who teaches that human beings and dinosaurs co-existed.

Itâ€™s also easy to portray faith as a goofy fairy tale if you spend your time deriding tales of ancient miracles -- a burning bush! A virgin birth! A prophet swallowed by a fish! -- but never pause to acknowledge the far-fetched improbabilities inherent in atheism, see http://www.direct.ca/trinity/crutches.html.

Maher characterizes religion as â€œfantasy and nonsense.â€ Yet atheism is no guarantee of enlightened rationality. In a study released this past September, researchers at Baylor University found that adherence to â€œtraditional . . . religion greatly decreases credulity, as measured by beliefs in such things as dreams [foretelling the future], Bigfoot, UFOs, haunted houses, communicating with the dead, and astrology.â€ 

By contrast, those who reject traditional religion -- â€œself-identified theological liberals and the irreligiousâ€ -- are â€œfar more likelyâ€ to believe in superstition and the occult. Or other nonsense: Maher, for example, claims that aspirin is lethal, doubts that the Salk vaccine eradicated polio, and has praised the horse that threw Christopher Reeve.

So it is unsurprising that Maher sees only the foolishness and evil that religious people, like all people, are capable of, and misses entirely the extraordinary good that religion engenders. Numerous researchers have found that â€œreligious people are happier, more charitable, have more stable families, and contribute more to their communities.â€ They are less likely to suffer depression or commit suicide, to use drugs or be involved with crime, to drink to excess, or to smoke.

The Los Angeles Times reported last year on research showing that people without faith were less likely to help a poor or homeless person than religious believers. While both were equally likely to describe themselves as â€œgood citizens,â€ their charitable practices were strikingly different. 

Americans of no faith donated an annual average of $200 to charity; active-faith adults typically contributed $1,500. Even when church-based giving was subtracted from the mix, religious Americans donated twice as much to charity as the nonreligious.

It is no coincidence that so many hospitals, schools, homeless shelters, and aid organizations have been started and sustained by religious groups. 

We are creatures designed to flourish -- to heal and to help -- when we believe.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Is this movie in theater? I may have to see it  ( i doubt it&#039;s being played here though)

I remember him talking about it on a tv show i was watching it here. It seems very interesting and as Karl Marx said &quot; religion is Opiate for the masses, and it serves as state of false consciousness&quot;

Did he point out some cultures being more dependent on religion than others?]]></description>
