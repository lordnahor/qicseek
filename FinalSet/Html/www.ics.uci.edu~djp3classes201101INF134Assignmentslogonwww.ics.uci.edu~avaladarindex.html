<h2>Steps to create your webpage</h2>
<p> 1. Get your ics account activated. See <strong>bullet #7</strong> located <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/computing/web/faqs.php#mypage">here</a>. </p>
<p>2. Login to students@ics.uci.edu using sftp.  It is important to use students.ics.uci.edu <strong>not</strong> openlab.ics.uci.edu. The former allows you to do things that you can't do on the latter. You can use utilities like WinSCP.

<p>3. If you get a warning like this (and it's the first time that you have connected to this machine) click &quot;Yes&quot;</p>

<p>4. Setting up Your ~/public_html Directory </p>
<p>Create a subdirectory public_html in your home directory on the remote machine. </p>

<p>5. Drag and drop files from your local computer to the remote computer. Place the documents you want to web browsers to be able to find  in this public_html directory or in further subdirectories. </p>
<p>6. All filenames must end with an appropriate extension (the part after the last dot). </p>
<p>For example, all HTML documents should have filenames ending in .html, all text documents 
  should have filenames ending in .txt, and all PostScript documents should have filenames ending in .ps.</p>
<p>7. Accessing your webpage</p>
<p>If I put the file index.html in the directory /home/djp3/public_html, then I would point my web browser to https://students.ics.uci.edu/~djp3/index.html to find it. </p>
<p>For example, for login name peteranteater, the URL http://www.ics.uci.edu/~peteranteater/myfile.html will access ~peteranteater/public_html/myfile.html. </p>
<p>The URL http://www.ics.uci.edu/~peteranteater/ (i.e. no filename) is the same as http://www.ics.uci.edu/~peteranteater/index.html </p>
