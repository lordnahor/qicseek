		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ramesh,

What an interesting insight!  

I think that your idea strikes out along a path similar to the notion of events that we discussed a few years ago.  Back then, we wrestled with the problem of capturing the full context of an event.  You made a lot more progress in that area than I.  But, the problem is still hard; interesting but really hard.  

A language of experience seems like a way to capture more of the context that surrounds our individual existances.  That language should include the complex and fleeting web of social interactions and conventions that help shape our behavior.  Environmental context would be part of the language as well.  I&#039;m sure the language would have many more facets. (&quot;Facets&quot; may imply more structure than can exist)

Thinking out loud for a few sentences....   Phenomena like Google, Twitter, wiki&#039;s, blogs and such capture more and more content from an incresingly diverse and nichey population.   That diffluent content swirls, boils and evaporates into Internet atmosphere, to condense and rain down somewhere.  I wonder if that seemingly chaotic content contains your language of experience, somehow?

Lets catch up.  It&#039;s been too long since we talked.
