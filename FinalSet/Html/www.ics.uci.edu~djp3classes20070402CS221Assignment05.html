  <p>The
    goal of this project is to implement a particle filter (Monte Carlo Recursive Bayesian Network Solver) to solve the robot localization problem </p>
  <ul><li>This is an individual project. Your work should be done on your own. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You can do this project in any language/environment that you want.</li>
        <li>The deliverable is an animation of the particle filter working. </li>
        <li>This assignment is now extra credit/optional. </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>Download a map of the environment
      (an office building)
      <ol>
        <li>Map in bmp format: <a href="Assignment05/map.bmp">here</a>. </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Download the observation data
      <ol>
        <li>Located <a href="Assignment05/fr079-sm.log">here</a>.  </li>
        <li>The main reason why this is an extra credit assignment is because I ran out of time to figure out the format of the observation file. It is mostly obvious, but there are some orientation issues that aren't clear.</li>
        <li>All of this data comes from <a href="http://radish.sourceforge.net/">RADISH</a> if that helps at all. In particular this data is from <a href="http://cres.usc.edu/radishrepository/view-one.php?name=fr079">freiburg</a>. </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Write code
    <ol>
      <li>Write code to load the map image into an occupancy grid.
        <ol>
          <li>An occupancy grid is a 2-D array that has a number from 0.0 to 1.0 indicating the probability that there is an obstruction in the location which is represented by that grid cell. Basically a grayscale bitmap. </li>
          <li>For example, a 10m by 10m room which is divided into 20 cells on each side would become an array with 400 elements in it. Each element would be a probability that there is an obstruction in the .5m by .5m cell represented by an entry in the array.</li>
          <li>The image above has 5 cm x 5 cm cells. </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Write a function which returns the distance to a wall:
        <ol>
          <li>float scanDistance(map,x,y,theta);</li>
          <li>to do this you have to orient the map and the theta.
            <ol>
              <li>I used postive y to be up in the bitmapped image.</li>
              <li>I used positive x to be right in the bitmapped image.</li>
              <li>I used 0 degrees to be north/up, 90 degrees to be east/right.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Write a sensor model which uses the scanDistance function
        <ol>
          <li>float sensorModel(x,y,theta, map, list of scans)
            <ol>
              <li>This function takes a position, map and list of scans and returns a number from 0.0-1.0 indicating the probability that this list of scans could be generate with this pose (x,y,theta).</li>
              <li>You could do this by calculating the probability of each individual scan and multiplying them together.</li>
              <li>The probability of each individual scan could be a gaussian with a mean given by &quot;scanDistance&quot;</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Write a motion model which given a position and an estimated motion returns a new position
        <ol>
          <li>(x,y,t) motionModel(x,y,t,dx,dy,dt)
            <ol>
              <li>This would simple be adding if dx, and dy weren't estimates. So instead of adding, this should return a randomly generated new pose (x,y,theta) which is &quot;close&quot; to (x+dx, y+dy,t+dt). I don't know the real error parameters of the robot so you'll have to guess here as to what form &quot;random&quot; takes. (gaussian?) </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Write a class/object/data structure which represents the state (aka a particle)
        <ol>
          <li>A state is a robot's pose (x,y,theta)   and the particle's weight. </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Write a function that visualizes the current probability distribution
        <ol>
          <li>Displays the map and overlays the collection of particles.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol></li>
  
    <li>Put it all together    </li>
    <ol>
      <ol>
        <li>Generate a collection of particles randomly.</li>
        <li>Loop Forever
          <ol>
            <li>Visualize the state</li>
            <li>Get all the new ODOM (odometry) observations up to the next LASER observation
              <ol>
                  <li>Combine them into one odometry observation </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Move your particles, using your motion model and the combined odometry observation. </li>
            <li>Get a new LASER observation            </li>
            <li>Reweight all your recently moved particles using the sensor model    and the LASER observation</li>
            <li>Resample with replacement the particles to create a new particle set based on the weights after the LASER observation.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
    <li>Capture a sequence of still frames. Combine them into an animation. Turn the animation into Don with any necessary explanation. (djp3@ics.uci.edu). </li>
  </ol>
