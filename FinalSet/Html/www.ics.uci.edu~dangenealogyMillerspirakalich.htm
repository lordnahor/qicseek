Hi Moishe,


Thank you for your mail. I have already seen your website 
(which is very impressive, by the way). indeed, my family is 
descendant of the "Bnei Yissochur" - my great-grandfather, 
Yisachar Berish Kalich, was son of Yaakov Yantshi Kalich, 
son of Shmuel Zanvil Kalich from Istrik, who was son in law 
of Yaakov Uri from Turka, son-in-law of Moshe Sheinfeld, 
son-in-law of the "Bnei Yissochur". Please let me know if I 
can assist you in further information, and if you have any 
unformation regarding the Kalich Family.
thanks again, yaron

Dear Moishe and Louis


Has Yaron Pedhazur from Israel got in touch with you?
He found me through JewishGen and we exchanged some e-mails a few months
ago. He is a descendent of Frieda Uri (died 1895 in Zfat, married to
Schmuel Zanvil Kalech, born 1840, died 1883 in Zfat), sister of Chava Uri
(born 1850, great-great-grandmother of my wife Miriam) and sister of Raizel
Uri (married to Isaac Perlmutter). They were all children of R. Jakov Uri
and Ita Lea Schonfeld (Jakov Uri's second marriage). Ita Lea Schonfeld was
the daughter of Mosche Schonfeld and Sara Spira (daughter of the Bnej
Jisasschar). Mosche and Sara are the earliest common ancestors of Louis
Schonfeld and my wife Miriam.


Best regards to all of you


Daniel

Hi Moishe,
As far as I know the spelling is not crucial, I think the 
differnces come from the Idish language, but it is the same 
family anyway. I read the letters you put in your site, I 
cannot ad any descendants you don't already know. I must say 
the I can fully identify with the initial frustration of some
of the researchers, and the story in my family is quiet 
similar. my great-grandfather knew about the history of the 
family, and he even knew that his grandfather, Shmuel-Zanvil 
Kalich was son-in-law of Yakov Uri. Nevertheless, he said 
Yakov Uri was son-in-law of Bnei-Ysachar. therefore, we 
always thought it was through his wife Rivka. Few years ago a 
relative found "yurtsait" list of his grandfather, who was a 
son of Shmuel-Zanvil, and there - there was no rivka, but a 
grandmother in the name Itta Lea daughter of Moshe. We were 
abit confused, and then found out that it is already known 
that Yakov 2nd wife was Itta Lea, daughter of Moshe Schonfeld. 
As to your question - Shmuel Zanvil Kalich Lived in Istrik, 
Galicia. He was son of Yisaia Shlomo Zalman Kalich, the 
Istrik's Rav, who wason-in-law of Yisachar Berish Ber, the 
Rabbi of Istrik, son of Shmuel Zanvil Ber. it is obvious 
that Shmuel Zanvil Kalich was named after his ancestor, who 
died, according to Meorei Galicia, in 1837. therefore, i 
estimate that Shmuel Zanvil was born approximately in 1840. 
the family (includingthe father, Yisaia Zalman) moved to 
Safed, I guess between 1875 and 1878. Yisaia Zalman died in 
Safed in 1878. Shmuel Zanvil died in 1882, and His wife, 
Freide, in 1909. they had 2 sons i know of in Safed, one of 
them, Yakov Yantshi, was my great-great-grandfather. the 
other, Pinchas Arie, was the one who wrote the Yurtzait list.
Another son, Yitzchak, stayed in Istrik, and from him there 
is another branch of the family (i mainly know of the Lerner 
family of Antwerpen). As to Alan Miller, his branch of the 
family is related for sure. the same names appear in the 
families, and we think his ancestor, Gershon Kalich,who was 
born in Istrik,  was brother of Shmuel Zanvil Kalich, or of 
his father, Yisaia Zalman.
There is a lot that we don't know yet, especially about the 
ancestors of Yisaia Zalman Kalich and how the Kalich family 
is connected to the "Ohev Israel", Rabbi Abraham Yehoshua 
Heschel of Apt, and we hope to solve this mystery as well in 
the future ...
Please don't hesitate to ask further questions. I'll be happy
to hear from you again, yaron

Hi,
Can we start at the beginning. Was your ancestor named Freida?
Can you list her siblings and her own children? 
Where was she born, married, and where is her resting place? Do you have dates 
for these events?
Thanks!

Hi Moishe,
yes, Freide is my ancestor. she was daughter of Itta Lea and Yakov Uri. I don't 
know her year of birth, I can only estimate. she was married to Schmuel Zanvil 
Kalich. They had 3 children I know of: Yitzchak, Yakov Yantshi and Pinchas Arie. 
I do't know where she was born or married, only that she was probably born in 
Turka (where her father lived). As to where she was married - again, I can only 
guess it was in Turka or Istryk, where her husband, Schmuel Zanvil Kalich, came 
from.

What I know for sure is that she died in Safed in 1909.


As for the other dates: I can only estimate she was born around 1840. the family 
immigrated to Israel around 1875-1878, and one of their sons, Yitchak, was old 
enough to stay in Europe. therefore, it is reasonable to believe she was married 
not latter of 1858, therefore it seems reasonable to believe she was born around 
1840. furthermore, I estimate her husband was born around 1840 (since he was named
after his ancestor, Shmuel Zanvil ber).


Hope these details are of any help!

Hi Moishe,
thanks for your email. I know there is some kind of connection between the /uri 
family andAbraham Yeoshua Heshel From Apt, and maybe Yakov Uri's son was named 
after him. there are also Uri's descendants who has tradition that they are 
related to Heshel of Apt. the same tradition exist in  the Kalich Family, but 
i'm not sure it is through the uri family. it may be through Shmuel Zanvil Kalich 
as well, but unfortunately it is still a mystery.

Dear Yaron,
Can you please help resovle a seeming contradiction? In my site, at

I have some of our correspondance. Can you tell me the dates of death for
Frieda Uri and Schmuel Zanvil Kalech?
Was it 1895 and 1883
or
was it 1909 and 1882?


In two of your letters you mention these seemingly different dates. Am I

Hi Moishe, to resolve the problem:


Freide Uri died 1909 - 7 Adar Trs"t


Shmuel Zanvil Kalich died 1983 (or 1982, I do not know the date according to the general 
calendar) - 16 Av Trm"g


The source is the mentioend Yartsait list of their son, Pinchas Arie.

Date: Fri, 15 Dec 2000 16:14:40 


Hi again,

As to your questions:

The yartsait list is a list written by Pinchas Arie Kalich, son of Shmuel Zanvil Kalich and 
Freide. I think it was written on a "Sidur", and it is in the posession of a grandson of 
Pinchas Arie, Pinchas, who lives in Safed. I never saw this list - I made contact with Pinchas 
after I heard that his father, Alter (son of Shmuel Zanvil) has something like a family tree 
of the family. Unfortunately, this list is all he has, and he read it to me over the phone. 
Since Pinchas is not interested in the research, I did not want to bother him further. the 
list contains the yartsaits of Pinchas Aries' direct ancestors:

His father, Shmuel Zanvil son of Yishaia Shlomo Zalman, died 16 Av TRM"G.
His grandfather, Yishaia Shlomo Zalman son of Moshe Yosef, died 10 Heshvan.
His grandmother, Esther Roize daughter of Yisachar Berish, died Yom Kipur.
His Brother, Yakov Yantshe son of Shmuel Zanvil, died 4 Kislev TRN"CH
His mother in law, Feige Rivka daughter of yakov Arie, died 12 Tevet TRS"T.
His mother, Freide daughter of Yakov, died 7 Adar TRS"T.
His grandmother, Yuta Lea daughter of Moshe, died 26 Adar A`.
His grandfather, Yakov son of Pinchas Arie, died 1 Elul.
His father in Law, Asher son of Moshe, died 7 Nisan TRP"H

In the stamp of Pinchas Arie he described himself as a descendant of the "Rokeach", Abraham 
Yehoshua Heschel of Apt and Tzvi Elimelech of Dinov.

I hope it helps. I'll send you latter details regarding Shmuel Zanvil's descendants.


Best regards,
yaron

Dear Mr. Langsam,
I am Gershon Lehrer ,live in Antwerp,Belgium and study in Israel.

I am being told (by Mr. Louis Schonfeld) of the existence of a discussion
group for people who research after descendants of the Bnay Yissachar
Zatsa"l.Could you please give me more information on the purpose of the
discussion group.

I am a grandson of the grandson of Yitschak Kallech who was a
grandson of Yaakov Uri who was a grandson of the Bnay
Yissachar Zatsa"l. 

By the way,I saw on your site that the name  Avrohm Abba Miller is being
mentioned. I am from my mother's site a descendant of Timberg whose family
originally comes from Krakow,Poland and lived afterwards in the
Netherlands/Belgium. In the Timberg family you find a few Abraham Abba's.
May be the name comes originally from the same roots as the name of
Avrohm Abba Miller comes?

My maternal grandfather (Packter) was a son of Lea Packter.Lea 
      Packter's maidenname was Timberg.Her father was Shmuel Timberg.His
      father was Avrohm Abbe Timberg.I don't know a lot about the
      Timbergs but I know that they used to live in Belgium/The

      that it was a big family.

Right.

My paternal grandfather was Yissachar Beirish Lehrer z"l.His father
     was Gershon Lehrer z'l. (I am named after him.) His father was
     Yitschok Kallech z"l. He maried Itta (Itte) Lehrer.Thus my family
     name comes from her.
     (The rest you probably know ;
     The father of Yitschok Kallech was Shmuel Zenvil Kallech and his
     mother was Frida.The father of Frida was Rav Yakov Yentshi Ori and
     her mother was Lea Schonfeld (or may be Scheinfeld ?).The father of
     Lea was Moshe Schonfeld.Her mother was Soroh a daughter of the Bnei

Dear Moishe,
    My great grandfather Yitzchak Kalich's first wife, was Ettie Lehrer, with whom he had 
three children. She left Istrik for Dresden at the start of the first world war, with the 
three boys. 

    He remarried, and had two children with his second wife. From this second marriage, one
son survived, and has passed on since then, but one of his sons is still alive, called 
Shmuel Kalich, and lives in Tel Aviv.

    Shmuel Zanvil Kalich and Frida, had three children as far as I know: Yitzchak, Pinchas,
and Yaacov. Alan Miller might know more about it. 

    You still have not replied to me regarding the book by Suzan Wynne.

Hi,

Hope you all had a pleasant Chanukah. 

I am looking for additional information (preferably GEDCOM or FTM 5.0b or earlier) to flesh out your 
part of the tree. All of you descend from Freida Uri + Shmuel Zanvil Kallech (Kalich). They had three 
children that I am aware of. Can anybody please help to add or enhance what I have? An outline tree is 
presented below. Some of this is available through the website at www.langsam.com

Some specific questions I am looking to answer:
* I know nothing of Pinchas Aryeh Kallech, son of Shmuel Zanvil. How many children did he have? Who is 
the best contact for information on this branch?
* Did Yitzchok Kallech, son of Shmuel Zanvil, have any other children besides Gershon? 
* I found an entry in Meorei Galicia (Meir Wunder 4:538) for Yakov Yentshi Kallech, where it lists four 
of his children. Can anybody expand on this? Yaron, I am guessing that you might have something on this 
branch since he and his daughter married Podhortzer's
* Any cousins you do not see listed, but should be?

Thanks for your help!

Hi,

Mr. Strassman from Antwerp might know more about the Kallech brand.His email 
is 83@skynet.be .


I would like to ask you if you could send me a GEDCOM file of the whole family 
tree you have got.Also the other branches of the Spira family.
And if you do may I than redistribute it among other family members and friends 
etc?


I use meanwhile the shareware version of Brother's keeper.


Regards an Good shabbos,


Gershon Lehrer

Thank you for your letter. I actualy knew all that and more before you wrote me, 
but thank you anyway. Gershon Lehrer is was also a descendant of the "Moier 
veshomesh", the Apter Rov, the Istriker rabbonim and the Masei Rokeach at least 
three times over.

Son-in-law of Zalmen Lehrer who is a son-in-law of Gershon Lehrer.

Dear Moishe,
I had a look at your site, and It's very impressive!
In it I saw a letter from Yaron Pedhazur, in which he mentions a Yahrtzeit 
list of one of his relative's grandfather, does anybody you know of have 
a copy of it? You also mentioned that the langsam - Spira family book by Susan 
Wynne is still available, can you tell me where I can obtain it?

Enclosed is a copy of my family tree the way I have it. 

Best regards, and thanks for your help,        
                            Danny

Shalom Moishe,


Thank you for contacting us. You contacted my son's site (nadalia) while the
family site was built and is maintained by me.
If what you're looking for is in the Lehrer ancestry, then I'm not  the
correct address.
You could contact Danny Lehrer ( a grandson of Gershon)
at:lehrer@lehrer.homechoice.co.uk
or Gershon at: gershon lehrer [gershon_lehrer@hotmail.com]


Good luck,
Shmuel Kehati

 Hi,
 WE have corresponded briefly in the past. Below is an outline descendant
 tree of what little I know of the first four generations of Frieda Uri and
 Shmuel Zanvil Kallech. Can you review and comment?  The two specific areas
 of interest would be
 1). Any info on the family of Pinchas Aryeh Kallech, son of Shmuel Zanvil
 Kallech and Frieda Uri.
 2). Any info on the four siblings of Gershon Lehrer (really Kallech).

 Thanks so much for your help and assisstance.

 PS: Rabbi Kreiswirth of Antwerp is a cousin of ours, also through R' Yakov Uri.

The 2nd Wife of Yitzchok Kallech had only 2 children one   Yehoshua
Mordechai Kallech - 1990 died about 8 years ago and a daughter Faiga who
perished in the war.
Please read attached document for descendants of Gershon Lehrer- Kallech.
The reason he was called Lehrer is because his parents divorced because they
had a lot of children and they all died except 4 sons, due to the fact that
they were related many times over that it had an effect on the children and
they did not want to have any more children that will die.

Leiser Strassman
