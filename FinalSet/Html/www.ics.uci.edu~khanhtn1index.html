<p> I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science Department at UCI. My advisor is <a class="1" href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~guoqingx/">
Prof. Guoqing (Harry) Xu </a>. 
<br>My research focuses on static and dynamic program analysis. Currently I'm involved in developing a transforming technique that can be scalable for Big Data applications.
<br>I earned my B.S. in Computer Science from UCI in Spring 2012. Prior to this, I earned my A.A. (Mathematics) and A.S. (Computer Sience) from Fullerton College in Spring 2010  
</p>
<p>
I had the chance being the mentor for several highly-motivated and talented high school students who were summer interns in our research group: 
<ul>
<li>Allen Min and Jonathon Tsai (2012, from Gretchen A. Whitney high, both are now at UCI)
<li> Wendy Wei (2013, from University high)</ul></p>
<br> My current CV can be found <a class="1" href="CV.pdf"> here </a>

 <td>Sudoku Solver: </td> <td> A mini project from CS-171: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (Spring 2011, taught by Prof. Rick Lathrop) A relatively simple Sudoku solver that solves the standard 9x9 Sudoku board with many AI techniques. 
 <br>In summer 2012, for 3 weeks, the two summer interns Allen and Jonathon worked on this subject and built this impressive solver which can both solve and generate 9x9, 16x16, 25x25 boards using several AI techniques. You can download the runnable <a class="1" href="Sudoku.jar">here</a> and the downloadable <a class="1" href="Sudoku.rar" >here. </a> Thanks Allen and Jonathon for agreeing to release this solver!

<tr> <td> Mancala: </td><td>A project from CS-175: Project in Artificial Intelligence (Winter 2011, taught by Prof. Max Welling) A smart, self-learning Mancala player that can improve strategy while playing with an opponent. You can download the runnable <a class="1" href="Mancala.jar">here</a>. (You will need <a class="1" href="wood-texture.jpg">this background</a> as well - download it into the same folder of the runnable). I plan to have a user guide for this in the future. In the meanwhile, if you are interested, please contact me for further instructions on how to fully enjoy the game.
