Dear Moishe:
I have been interested in finding my family roots for a long while.  I know that
my grandfather (Henry E Miller born 1899 in Russia) immigrated from Russia 
(actually he and his brother were stowed away on a freight ship around 1920) to 
California by way of Canada. I have never met my grandfather, he died before I 
was born, but I am told that he was a Jew, and his father was sending (stowing 
away) a child or two every year to America as he could afford it. I know that my
grandfather was one of seven including a pair of identical twins who never made 
it to the West. He had a grandmother named Abraham Mueller, I believe. They 
supposedly came from a town whose name when translated means &quot;Jewtown&quot;.
Do I need much more information?
Thanks, 
Jeffrey Miller

I'm researching my family tree and found your page.  I wonder if there's a 
connection.  My grandfather was Max Miller.  Born 1894, Immigrated 1905.
His father's name was Velvel ( born circa 1866) and his mother Chana Berkowitz. 
Velvel's father was named Moishe.  They lived, as far as I know, in Gac, a 
village near Lomza, Poland.
     
Does any of this ring a bell?

Hi Moishe,
     
I too am a Mu&quot;ller/Miller.  My mother's maternal grandfather was named 
Johann Mu&quot;ller and was born in Deckendorf (Deggendorf), in Lower 
Bavaria (where the Isar and the Donau meet -- the Isar is the little 
river flowing through Mu&quot;nchen (Munich) that people ride flat log-rafts 
on in the summer and the Donau is the Danube).   He was born
Feb 12, 1860 and came to Pittsburgh in 1881.  He had a rule that only 
German was to be spoken in the house and after having been in America 
for 19 years (according to the 1900 census) he was still not a US 
citizen while his wife was.  Perhaps he could not or would not learn 
English, which was required for naturalization.  But he later got
his citizenship and from then on, conscientiously voted in every 
election.  The polling places back then were always in barber shops 
according to my Gramma because women were not yet allowed to vote.
     
His wife, whose maiden name was Meder, was from extreme eastern Slovakia 
and was born near Kaschau (Kosice, Kassa).  Family stories say she had 
sisters but I don't know if they came to America or stayed in Slovakia. 
Their names are supposed to have been Nora, Leah, and Anna.  (Her name was 
Maria.)

Cecelia

Dear Moishe,
     
I read your message concerning Miller Family lineage. 
I do not know if this information is of use to you
but if you see any connection between your efforts and
my own to find our more about my family please let me know.
     
My grandfather, Morris Miller emigrated to Fall River 
Mass in the late 1800's. He was a tailor. Within a few 
years after settling in Fall River he moved to Newport 
Rhode Island where he worked for the Army at Fort Adams.
     
He was very active in the Jewish Community in Newport. 
I have a copy of his emigration permit which was signed 
by the King of Prussia. I know he had a strong German 
background and I suspect the what was then Prussia is
probably now within the current boarders of modern Germany.
     
My father told me that upon ariving on a boat in Newport 
Harbor he had some difficulty getting though the authorities 
in the U. S. and managed to &quot;jump ship&quot; and avoid the 
administrative delays.
     
Can you give me any suggestions how I might proceed to get 
more information. My grandfather died during the early 
1950's. He had sister who also settled in New England. I 
think it was is Boston.
     
Regards,

Shalom from Jerusalem,
     
Any friend of Menachim's is a friend of ours, if not relative.     
Yes, we do have Mullers in our tree.  My husbands great grandmother     
was Leah Muller married to Aharon Dovid Kornfeld, a Rav in Makow.
Her father was Gavriel Muller Av Beit Din in Maatersdorf, brother
of Nathan Muller who lived 1828-1891.  Their father was Chaim son
of Yaakov son of Yechiel son of Nathan born approx. 1700. Does any
of this look familiar if so I'd love to see what you have as well.
I have the aboves wives names as well if we're related. Truthfully,
on this family I had concentrated mainly on the who descended
straight from Rashi thru Rebbe Akiva Eger (Shlezinger family) if
they too are related let me know. What sources have you been using
in your search?  What towns are you tracing? Do you have and Sifre
Yichusin or family records?
     
Waiting to hear back.  Good Luck,  Rena Novack

Shavua Tov Moishe,
I don't know the years Leah Muller lived tho I have a picture of
her and could find out since her daughter is still living (my
husbands grandmother is in an old age home in Lakewood). She had
2 sisters and four brothers who I know of, her sisters were
Machla and Pearl her brothers were:Adolph, Yisroel, Yoel and Moshe 
Muller. Her mother's name was Hinda, her father, as I mentioned,
Gavriel. Dovid's grandmothers sisters and brothers were:
Chedva Gizzie and Rozie, brothers were:Yisroel, Avraham Abba,
Emil, Lazar and Shalom Yehuda her name was Pearl, do any of these
names ring a bell?

Again Shavua Tov and Lehitraot,  Rena Novack

Boy, is my face red!! I apologize for my long delay in replying to your inquiry.
Its not rudeness but a lack of organization and diminishing brain

Anyhow its probably a long shot for any commonality of trees but one can 
hope. I generated the following file today so that the problem wont

Rather then speculate about it here is a summary of my MILLERS.

MILLER Family                   updated 7-29-96
     
I have only been able to trace my MILLER side to my ggf and I 
have few hard facts about the early branches.
     
Hyman MILLER (ggf) m Toby  ?                     
They had six children 
      Sarah  m. Sam EDENBAUM
      Anna  m. Ben MILLER
      Ben   m. Lena ------?
      Isaac m. Zelda MAGID
      Joe  m. Clara -----?
      Pearl  18?? - 1973  (my Grandmother) m. Philip SMUGOWICZ
All are presumed to have been born near the town of Lomza, 
Poland but only on the basis that her husband Phillip was 
born/lived in Piantnica near Lomza. 
     Grandmother Pearl married Philip SMUGOWICZ  ( who resided
in Piatnica) 
     They had 4 Children. The first 3 were born in Lomza and the
4th in Toronto (where the family had emigrated to and adopted the 
LEVINE Name.)
     They emigrated in the time frame of 1904 -1912 
             Samuel  1899-1976 (my Father ) m. Eva CHAIKOFF
              Rebecca 1901 - 1994 m Jack LERNER  
              Fred  1904-1986 m. Thelma PARNESS
              Rose 1913 -1982  m  Isadore LAPIDUS 
Most of Hyman's children lived in central New Jersey though I am 
not sure how  they arrived there and I am also uncertain as to 
whether Hyman ever emigrated. I have quite a bit of tree data 
for Hyman's descendants but not a lot of dates or other hard 
data. 
And of course as with the SMUGOWICZ-LEVINE switch,  who knows what MILLER 
might have been in Poland!
     
If the above provides any areas of  possible
connection please dont hesitate to contact me by email , snail, or hail.

Hi Moishe,
     
I do not believe that Saul Miller is still alive.  The book he wrote, 
&quot;Dobromil: Life in a Galician Shtetl 1890-1907&quot; was published in 1980.  
There is a photo of Saul Miller in the beginning of the book and he looks 
to be in his 70's.  It is now 16 years latter.  However, in the book, I 
found a card that might be his son's.  It says: Leo Miller, P.O. Box 
1107, New York, NY 10009.  Hope this is of some help.

Dear Moishe,
     
I'm glad you e-mailed me because I was going to write to you again!  I 
believe we corresponded by snail mail some time ago.  Since then, I have done 
some more research, but don't know whether or not it will help us make a 
connection.  As for your note regarding translating material about Munkacs, 
that is not part of the Miller family.  The Miller family is my husband's 
side and the Munkacs people are on my side.
     
First the Miller family:  Chaim (Hyman) Miller lists his birthplace as both 
Maciow (ship manifest) and Wolza (naturalization).  He was orphaned as a 
child and grew up in the family of the woman he married Feige (Fanny) Bieber 
from Kovel.  They lived in Kovel before emigrating to the US, Chaim in1907 
and Feige with child Nate age 5 in 1911.  There was another older male child 
who died in a fire in Kovel prior to their emigration.  Chaim's (b 1878) was 
the son of Natan Nuta.  He had a brother Hirsch (Harry) Miller who was born 
in Triesk (Manifest).  Unfortunately, that is all we know regarding the &quot;old 
country&quot;.  A search from JGFF revealed that you are also researching Miller 
from Maciejowa and was wondering if that could be the same town as Maciow and 
a possible connection.
     
Second, Munkacs: The family names I am researching from this city are GROSS 
and EISDORFER.  I have a copy of the Munkacs chapter from Arim ve-Immahot 
be-Yisrael (Jewish Mother Cities) ed. Ha-Cohen Fishman 1946.  If you are not 
familiar with this work and willing to summarize/translate I can send you a 
copy.  If you have already seen it, I would greatly appreciate your sharing.
 It is about 20 pages of small Hebrew text, no vowels.
     
I hope we can help each other out.  Please use this e-mail address 
rmiller871@aol.com instead of the one at Dowling.  Thank you.

Just looked at your Miller page. It always seemed like such a common

my great-grandfather, aaron david muller, was born in Ivanovo/Janowa, 
not far from Pinsk. his father was Solomon Muller, who died in December 
1926, probably in Pinsk. AD was born in 1883, so Solomon is probably 
around the 1850s. we always thought the name was miller until i looked 
at the passenger list. there, another surprise was that his US sponsor 
was an uncle, S. Schwartz, in brooklyn. AD's mother was Ida Matizansky, 
who survived Sol, but there's no further info. There also might have 
been a sis (AD's) named Yentl. this assumption is based on a photo with 
a yiddish inscription.
     
That's all i know about the Mullers.
     
I do know the town of Lenartov, though, since my Frankel family was from 
there. I recall seeing the name Lauer in the Slovak vitals for that 
area.
     
Good searching!

&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;Off hand no, but perhaps you can list the siblings of Morris (Yidel Moshe)?
     
I wish I could, I only know about his descendants. There is persistant rumor 
that there were (are) Miller relatives in Chicago, but I don't relish the 
idea of calling all the Millers and asking. &lt;grin&gt;.
     
     
&gt;Also, please see my new site at 
&gt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/HOMEMILR.htm
     
Looks great. I like the Hebrew names and photographs. I certainly wish I had 
that much material about any of my families in Europe.  
     
As far as intersecting, the Belarus Mullers are the most likely to have been 
related. Its a real long shot, but Samuel could have been a brother/cousin 
to my Morris. Unfortunately, nobody seems to remember anything. 
     
     
Thanks for checking
Michael

&gt;Take Care,

Hello Moishe,
     
I saw your name in the Family Finder and read your Jewishgen Home Page. I was 
wondering which Miller family you were looking for from Dobromil? Do you have 
a Mordechai and Rosa Knopf Miller on your family tree? Their children were 
Harry, Alex, Sarah, Pessel and Rifka. Alex wrote a chapter in the Dobromil 
Yizkor Book. I am most interested in the Knopf side of this family.
     
Looking forward to your reply.

Moishe,
     
I certainly enjoyed your new Miller home page. You are so lucky to have
those wonderful photos! I did not see any names that were familiar to me
except the children of Shlomo of Galicia. I noticed that there were no
names specifically from Dobromil or Przemsyl. Do you have any information
about the Miller's from there yet?
     
My information is sparse to say the least. Most of what I know about
the Millers in Dobromil comes from their yizkor book. Hersch Melamed
was the grandfather of Elie (Alex) Mehler. Alex was born in 1896. His
father Mordecai died in Dobromil in 1900. His mother Roizaly (Rosa) was
my gr-grandmother's sister. She was born in 1875. I gave you Alex's
siblings names in my last post. A brother, Hersch married one of my
grandmother's sisters, Baila Gross, from Przemsyl. She was his first
cousin. The Gross family was a very large one.

The name on their ships passenger list was Mehler, but was always
Miller, in the states. My husband and I were living in Ukraine for
9 months this past year. I was able to visit many of my ancestral
shtetls including Przemsyl and Dobromil. If it isn't too much trouble,
could you please check to see if you have any information about this
family.
     
Many thanks,
Sandi Goldsmith

Dear Moishe,
     
The Muller branch of my family goes back to Jonah Muller who married Rivka 
Wiesel of Sighet, Romania early in the 20th century.
     
Rivka's brother was the father of Eli Wiesel, the well-known author.
     
Jonah &amp; Rivka had at least 3 children - Helene, Alter, and Zivya.
     
Helene Muller married Moshe Herskovits of Ganech, Czechoslovakia. They had 
many children, 3 of whom survived the Holocaust and today live in NYC, 
Toronto, and Israel.
     
Is there any possible connection with your family or with anyone who you've 
come across in your research?
     
Please let me know either way!
     
Drop me an e-mail or feel free to call at 201 997 7134.
     
Sincerely,
Arnold Koch

I have only recently started to research my fathers' family tree (Miller) and 
have 'some' information about a few members of the family which may or may not 
connect with your family. I just recently saw your family page in JewishGenSite.
 I will give you a brief summary of what little I know about this Miller family.
The accuracy of spelling or other details is unknown to me. It would be of 
interest to me if you thought there might be any connection with any of the 
individuals you have documented on your family page.
     
 My Grandfather, Mendel Menachem Miller was reportedly born in 1868 in Kabaliak,
Poltava.  He married Shana(Galia) Zelickson in 1895 in Kremencug.4 chidren were 
born in Kremencug; 3 girls Raizel, Zelda, and Fruma; one son Avrum Fisher(my 
father); and after immigrating to Canada in 1906, they had one more son, Meyer 
Zalman.Kremencug is not all that close to locations of cities you have 
mentioned.  
     
Mendel Menachen is reported to have had 8 siblings; Hilkkel, Moitel, Zelda,and 4
more brothers and one more sister (names unknown).
     
Mendel Menachen and his brothers and sisters were the children of my Great 
Grandfather Avrum Fisher Miller and wife Raizel. I do not any information on 
their birthdates (probably about 1845?) nor their birthplaces.
     
The family immigrated to Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.
     
     
I would be pleased to hear from you.  Good luck in your research.

I have not dabbled in family geneology before but upon surfing into a Jewish 
geneology site found your page on Miller/Muller.  I am not sure if my Miller 
is also yours but you are best to decide. My father, Samuel Abraham Miller, 
now deceased, was born in 1901 in or around Pasvalys, Lithuania. His father 
was Harry Miller (Muller)(1870-1922), son of Chiam and Bluma (Weinberg) 
Muller. Harry was married to Mirila (Cheruf). Chiam and Bluma's other 
children were Ben-Zion (1857-1945), Leah, Lippa (1860-1940) and Hannach. 
     
This is as far back as I can go. Now that my curiosty is whetted I await 
your reply.  Gut Yom Tov.       Ron

Dear Moishe,
     
I noticed you are researching both the Miller name and some regions of 
Poland.  My direct line of decension is from Pultusk via Prychnitz. 
Some of my family has also been recorded in Ciechanow and Macavaw, 
however the bulk of my information is of the line coming from Pultusk.
     
I have heard the story of a mysterious &quot;cousin&quot; of ours named Gedalia 
(also known as Julius Miller) who apparently made the trip to the US in 
1905 with my grandfather's brother, Moishe Goldmacher.
     
I have been unable to turn up clue one about Julius Miller other than the 
fact that when he made the trip with my great-uncle Moishe he (Julius) 
apparently had a relative here who may have been a physician and that
he (Julius) lived amongst the family in Brooklyn.  All of my elder relatives 
remember glimpses of him in ther memories and instantly recognize the
name and say &quot;sure...he was a cousin&quot; but no one knows how.
     
Ring any bells with you?
     
Thanks for your help.

Hello from another Miller, Moishe!
I just stumbled onto your Webpage:
http://free.websight.com/Miller3/
My late father, Benjamin Hoffman Miller, came to Passaic, NJ in 1908 at 
age 8 from Brest-Litovsk with his mother (Sarah/Sunny/Sonya Hoffman 
Miller) and two step-sisters from his father's prior wife, Yente 
Susserman, who probably died in 1898.  My grandfather, Solomon Miller 
(after 1937, Samuel Miller, an independent tailor in Brest-Litovsk and 
later in NJ), came two years earlier to pave the way.
     
Although they have other descendants, I know nothing about their 
European ancestors or relatives, and I know of no other relatives who 
also immigrated to America.
     
I hope this helps, and I'm quite interested in any links which may 
appear.

 I have recently started to look into my family history/geeology.
  The Miller name is evident in both my mother's and father's family.
 On my mother's side, her mother, my grandmother's maiden name was Miller.
Her name was Pauline (Chai Perel).  She alwas said she was from Kieva 
Gubernya.
She had two brothers that I was aware of.  One, Sam, resided in Philadelphia.
 I am now in the process of tracing his daughter's family.  I know of no
other of his.
  There was another brother who I was told lived in Tallahassee,Fla.  Don't
know his name.
     
   On my father's side, his maternal grandparents were Millers---Joseph and
Rivka.  The family was from Austria-Hungary. For the most part my father's 
immediate family was from Galicia.  My father was born in Tarnapol. 
Other names:
Maternal--Strakoffsky
Paternal-- Lorber, Heller, Weintraub

If there is any connection E-mail     AGloger@aol.com        Thanks

In a message dated 97-01-22 11:25:40 EST, you write:
     
&lt;&lt;   I do have a potential connection for your maternal side with another 
      family. Let me go through some of the old Email that I have received 
      to try and find it.
     
              On my maternal side, I have little info.  All I know is:
                  Nachum Miller married?  3 children that I know of
--Pauline(dob 1876) (Chai Perel), 
                  Sam and another son.  Don't know if there were more
children.
                  Pauline married Moishe Strakoffsky.  His parents were Ita
Riya      
                  Leiberman and Yosef Strakoffsky. Moishe had brothers, Sam,
Jack( who settled in Leeds, Eng and changed his name to Jack Stratton.)  We 
recently found is decendants.
                Sam Miller married,  I am only aware of one of his children,
Celia, who married William Neistadt.  They are still in Philadelphia.
                As stated, they were  from Kieva Gubernya.  They were
Teteiver. Was there a city in the Gubernya called Teteiv?
     
      Can you give more details regarding your paternal Austro-Hungarian 
      side? Dates? Specific cities? Any other generations? This sounds like 
      a more promising area for us.
      May I add your Email to my &quot;unkown trees&quot; list on my site? &gt;&gt;
     
                 Paternal family--also little known. (I got a little confused
in my e-mail to you.)
                 Rivka (Rebecca)Miller married Josef Lorber.  They had a
daughter(my grandmother)Sara Golda(dob 1874) who married Anshel(Arnold) 
Weintraub (dob1876. There was also a son.  I believe his name  was Anton (?)
 He survived WWll . My father found his in Zagreb.
               I only remember my father saying that his grandparents(Rivka &amp;
Josef) were well off and lived in Vienna.  The last time he saw them was when 
he and his family came to Cleveland in 1922.  My father was then 15 yrs.
             My father's passport and naturalization papers state placeof
birth was Tarnopol, Poland.  I know he was born in Galicia and that after WWl 
it became Poland.  I'm not sure if the family was from the city of Tarnopol 
or the province.  I remember him saying something about the exact place 
shortly before he died in 1992.  
        I only started looking into family hx in Oct. 1996.  I still have a
lot of digging to do, but am watching message boards,etc and making 
inquiries.  Would appreciate any leads.  Realize the Miller name is common, 
and I don't have much to go on.
     
    If you want to add my e-mail to your &quot;unknown trees&quot; that would be OK.
 Can't see what harm could come of it.      
                                                                 Thanx  for

I was just beginning a genealogy research when I came across with your 
page.
My name is Teresa Miller and I'm afraid I don't know much but I tell 
you.
There was Gregory Miller (I don't know the Yiddish name; my father says 
is something like Herchle) who was born around 1860, somewhere in 
Poland. He lived in Plonsk; there he had around ten children; the 
youngest was Jacob (my grandfather),who was born in Plonsk in July, 
1898; about the rest of the brothers all I know is that at least one of 
them had moved to America, probably to Baltimore. Jacob had three 
children (one of them my father) and then moved to America.
I don't know if any of that could interest you, but I would be grateful 
if you had something that could help me.
Bye.

I have looked at your web site and am curious to know if you have any family 
members in the Prussia area of Germany.
     
My g-great grandfather, Lewis Miller, came from Prussia (on the immigration 
form, he just wrote Prussia, no city name or anything). He came over here in 
1869.
     
Thank you!

I was most interested to come across your page this pm.  In particular 
the connection to the Miller familyy in Africa (South A in aprticular).  
My name is Ian Miller, only son/child of Samuel Bernard Miller who was in 
turn one of 4 (?) children of Frank (Ephraim) Miller.  I would guess he 
came to SA probably at the turn of the Century.  I understand there were 
at least 2 brothers in SA.  There were also connections, I believe, to N. 
Ireland, Scotland and England.  One cousin has Irish passports and 
connections
     
Could there be a link?

Hi there Moishe. Is it possible that we are related? I am just beginning my 
research into my Miller family roots. My name is Marshall Miller of 
Winnipeg, Canada. I am 33 years of age. My father is Frank Miller. He is 
the son of Louis Miller, a poor peddlar who immigrated to Canada from 
Russia as a young boy. At this point my knowledge of times and places is 
very limited but I hope to learn more soon. My Great Grandfather's name was 
Frank Miller, the son of Nathan Miller all of whom were from Eastern 
Europe. If any of this sounds familiar, or you can offer any clues to aid 
in my research I would be truly thankful.
Thanks,
     
Marshall

Good afternoon Moishe, 
   My name is Michael Levy, named after my great grandfather, Moishe 
Miller!!!  I linked to your wonderful home page via the Jewish Gen Family 
Finder.  I have gotten interested in tracing my roots over the last few 
months, and have started to collect some good information.  
     
    My great grandfather, Morris Miller, had a brother named Simon, and 
they originally lived on the easter shore of Maryland, in Pocomoke City. 
 They each married a daughter of the KLAFF family, of which there is an 
entire published history.  Morris died in  1959, in Baltimore.  He had 
left Pocomoke in the early part of the century, buying a farm in 
Reisterstown Maryland, the house still standing to this day.  I recently 
corresponded with a John Miller, also living in Maryland, and it turns 
out we are related.  John says his grandfather A.J. was helped to this 
country by Morris, who was his uncle.  He does not know the name of 
A.J.'s father, who I guess would be Morris's brother.  A.J. is buried in 
Calif. I believe.
     
   If any of this is relevant or familiar to you, I would love to hear 
it.  Thank you for your wonderful home page, and I hope we find a 
connection.
     
Michael

Good morning Moishe,
  I believe I wrote to once before, but do not remember the reply.  I
visited your web site again this morning, and decided to write to you. 
My name is Michael Levy, named for a Moishe Miller, or Morris Miller, 
who died around 1958, age 99.  He married Annie Klaff, and the had a 
large family in the Pocomoke City, MD area for many years, before 
settling on a farm just outside Baltimore.  They had four daughters- 
Rebecca, (my grandmother, Mary Weinman, Pearl Lichtenberg, Lillie 
Miller, and one son, Simon Miller.  Does any of this sound familiar to 
you.
     
Looking forward to hearing from you. 
Michael Levy

Dear Moishe

I write to you from Johannesburg South Africa , my grandfather was a
Miller who emmigrated to Africa in the 1930's from Ponovish Lithuania.
The family tree as best as I can establish from my mother is as follows

Isaac Behr Miller lived in Ponovish Lithuania he had 8 children two of 
whom are still alive living in Isreal.
The children are
Zallie Miller (alive) est age 82 has three children
Rose ?       (alive) est age 90 very frail no other details known to me
Chaim Miller(d 60's)had two children.
Vera ?        (d 90,s)had one son and lived in NY
Chava ?     (d  ? ) no details known to me
Sonia Pomeranz(d 80's) had 2 sons living in Isreal (one of these sons
                   may have a family tree)
Shura Feldman (d 70's) had three children 
Joseph Miller (d 1948) my grandfather had three children all of whom
                live in Johannesburg. I believe that one of my cousins has 
                Quite an extensive family tree.

Mr. Miller

Although I have been researching my own family's genealogy
for over 10 years, I have just begun looking into my wife's
family and found your Miller home page. I am seeking
information on my wife's great-grandfather HERMAN JOSEPH
MILLER (1850 - 1944).  His wife's name was Yetta (nee?)
Miller (1864-1942).  According to my father-in-law, Herman
landed in Philadelphia, (when, I don't know) and lived most
of his life in the US in Chicago.  Children were Theodore
Harvey Miller,  Abraham Miller, Jacob J. (Jack) Miller,
Harry Miller and Bell Miller.  Other than my wife's
immediate family, I don't have much additional information.

Any assistance will be appreciated.

dear Moishe
     
I just happened to come across your page by accident.
     
however, I was facinated to find out that someone is
researching the Miller background. My name is Yitzchok
(Issac) Miller My father was born in a small town in Russia
called Dubveh.
     
My grandfather (deceased) was in Aushwitz and survived.
However, His first family was presumed dead, and he
remarried again in russia.  My father is from the
second marriage.
     
If you get any other information pertaining to the Miller
Roots please feel free to inform me. My main concern is to
try and find out if anyone from my grandfathers first marriage
survived the campes of Aushwitz.
     
Thank you in advance,
     
Yitzchok Miller.

Moishe,
     
I saw in the JFF that you were researching MILLER in KOROTICHI.   I was 
using the DM Soundex system for MILLER from  GORODISCHE.  GORDOSICHE is near 
BARANOVITCH in then MINSK GUBERYNIA, BELARUS.
     
My family name is MILLER and my grandfather was MALACHOVETSKY or some such 
spelling from GORODISCHE.  His name was MOISHE AARON MALACHOVETSKY who 
changed his name to HARRY MILLER.  He emigrated to Canada
     
     
I was wondering where KOROTICHI was and if MILLER was your original last name?
     
     
Thanks for telling me you could not read the message.  Could you tell me the 
reason why you could not read it.  I wrote it through Microsoft Explorer and

Dear Moishe,
     
Thanks for contacting me.  I checked your Mille website, but did not see an 
immediate connection with my family.  However, I would like to add my 
information.  It's great that you have started this.  I had almost given up 
hope of making progress with a common name like Miller.  Anyway, perhaps 
you can post this information for me:
     
My maternal grandmother's name was Ida Miller.  She was one of thirteen 
children of Jacob Miller and Zecil Hartman.  They came from Austria-Hungary 
(now Ukraine) and I'm pretty sure they came from the town of Tysmenitsa. 
Their children who survived childhood were Huna (called Max, b abt 1887, 
married Gussie Steinberg in Europe), Jossel (b after 1887, married Anna 
Gelder in NYC), Raiza (b after 1887), Sarah (b after 1887, never married), 
Ida (b 1892, married Samuel Reiter in NYC), and Evelyn (b after 1892, 
married Nathan Stern in NYC).  All the children lived in Brooklyn.  They 
emigrated to the US between 1906 and about 1913.  Raiza was not allowed to 
enter the US because she had tuberculosis.
     
I can be reached at &lt;mail08686@pop.net&gt; or at 7508 Hampden Lane, Bethesda,

Dear Moishe -
     
I took another look at your tree and saw a possible connection between my 
great grandfather Jacob (Yacov) Miller and Yacov, son of Menachem Mendel 
(grandson of Chaim Leib).  It is possibe they could be the same person. 
The dates fit and the names of Jacov's children seem consistent with a 
possible relationship, particularly my grandmother's name, Ida (same as 
Ita?).  All I know about Jacov was that he was a very intelligent and 
learned person, but of limited means.  He may have had a physical
disability.  I also know that one of his sons was a math whiz.  Is Bukowsko 
anywhere near Tysmentisa?  Tysmenitsa is just east of Stanilov (now Ivano 
Frankovsk) at lat/long 48,54'/24,51'  Can you tell me anything else that 
might help verify the connection?

Dear Moishe
     
My message must have been lost in cyberspace.  My maternal grandmother's 
maiden name was Ida (I noticed several Ita's in your tree.  Could this be 
the same name?) Miller.  She was born in Galicia in 1892.  I believe she 
lived in or near Tysmenitsa, which was part of Austria-Hungary and is now 
in the western Ukraine, near Ivano-Frankovsk.  Her parents were Jacob 
(Yacov) Miller and Zecil Hartman (Hertzman?).  The names of her siblings 
who survived childhood were Huna (pronounced Choona), also called Max, Joe, 
Raiza, Sarah, and Evelyn.  If I understand your tree correctly, Chaim Leib 
(1763-1866) was a Miller from Galicia who had a son Yacov whose age could 
match that of my great-grandfather Yacov.  Unfortunately, I know little 
about him except that he was a learned man who may have had some physical 
disability.  According to my aunt, he earned his living as a kind of 
village advisor.  Any suggestions you might have for establishing a 
connection would be appreciated.  Your web site is terrific!

Your tree has Chaim Leib (c1873-1866) with 7 known children, one of whom was
Menachem Mendel (c1830-1915).  One of Menachem Mendel's children is listed
as Yacov (Josef?).

As I explained in my previous message, my grandmother's parents were named
Jacob Miller and Zecil Hartman.  They lived  and died in 	(now in
Ukraine).  Unfortunately, I do not know the names of their siblings or their
full Hebrew names.  My grandmother's siblings were names Max, Joe, Raiza,
Sarah, and Evelyn.  Some of these were clearly Americanized names.

It would be fine to list the information I've sent on your unkown Miller
page.  I will try to provide some more facts if I can.

I am writing because I have seen your homepage, and I am interested in 
finding my grandfather's family. My grandfather's name was Volfe Sisel Miller 
(we knew him as Velvl). He was born in 1889 and died in 1980. His parents 
were Lieb (Labe?) Miller, and Rivka Bakatursky Miller, from a town near 
Vilna, Lithuania. At some point they moved to Poland, near Warsaw. I am 
trying to find the name of the town, but I don't have it yet. His family were 
Cohanim.
     
 My grandfather came to the U.S. around 1905 at age16. He was sent by his
parents, aboard a ship which went first to England and then to the U.S. He 
had an uncle in New York named Morris Anderman who he found, but later lost 
track of. My grandfather was one of 12 siblings. The only one whose name I 
know is Gershon, and he may have gone to Israel. I am just beginning my 
research and would appreciate any information you might have.
     
My grandfather settled in Detroit, MIchigan around 1910 or so, and lived 
there the rest of his life.
     
Thank you for this opportunity. I look forward to hearing from you.

your excellent WEB page and the Broken Branches with a great deal of

but my information for this branch is not complete.  I have listed below 
the earliest known members of my Miller branch from Kremenets, Ukraine, 
Russia.

Israel Miller (b.1850), married Dvorah (1st wife) and Yetta (2nd wife) 
and had nine known children with Dvorah:  Ida (1872), Tobias (1878), Abraham,
Wolf (1883), Jacob (1889), Yetta, Hyman, Sadie and Kate (1882).

Hi Moishe,
I checked your website and don't see any connection so far.  Here's my story: 
my great aunt, Marysha (Miriam) TABACHNIK, from Vilna, emigrated here around 
turn of the century.  Either in the old country OR here, she married a man 
named MILLER, first name unknown.  They moved from NY to Cincinnati, had four 
children probably named Ted, Louis, Max and Jean (a girl).  One of the boys 
moved back east and lived with his cousins, the LISKINs in New Jersey and he 
worked for the Post Office.  This was probably in the 30s or 40s.  That's all 
I know.  I'm trying to find MILLER's first name so I can track the family. 
Any connections?
     
Cheers,

Dear Mr. Miller,
     
I am seeking information about Moses Miller from Russia (I do not know the 
city).  He had the following children:  Louis Sachs (name changed to Sachs 
from Miller to avoid the conscription into the Russian Army), my great 
grandfather; Joseph, Etta, Elyah, and Lena (I beleive that Lena was the 
daughter of Moses and his  niece who he married).  Louis (Miller) Sachs' 
second wife (my greatgrand mother) was Ida Katzenellenbogen who was the 
granddaughter of the Goan of Vilna, Lithuania.  I believe that Louis Sachs 
was also a rabbi.  If you or any of your readers have any further 
information about this Miller family, please write me at audie@ezl.com.

You e-mailed me regarding the Miller home page, which I enjoyed a great deal. 
Unfortunately, all I know is that the earliest Miller I have Louis or Lewis 
Miller, my PGGF, who lived in Baltimore at one point, then possibly Pittsburg, 
and is thought to be buried in the Chicago area.  We may be connected, but I 
have no way to make the connection.  Your names did not include the first 
names of any of my known Miller relatives.  Thanks anyway.  Sincerely--Judy

Moishe, I wish I knew.  We know virtually nothing about him or his family. 
The only thing we know about Louis/Lewis is that he married Betsy Krulewitch 
whose family was from Baltimore &amp; Lithuania, they may have lived in Pittsburg 
at one point--ify, they lived on the Lower East Side, and that he may have 
died in Chigago...He was astranged from the family by the time my GF Philip

I am researching my ancestor &quot;Meshel&quot; Miller, who married Chaya Schaindel 
Schertzer and were the parents of Tillie (Taibe) Kandel, who died in 1943 in NYC
and was married to Samuel (Schloime Niteh) Kandel. She was born in 1870, and 
apparently came with here husband from Narajow in Galicia. I don't have any hard
information on this (the microfilm of the passenger list index is too smudged to
read) but they were buried in the Narajow Bros. plot in Mt. Zion cemetery in 
Queens. Apparently Tillie Kandel's parents didn't emigrate to the US, since on 
her death certificate their names are given in only Hebrew/Yiddish form, and 
have no English equivalents. The informant for her death certificate is Esther
Miller, who was her daughter and perhaps married a cousin on the Miller side.
Narajow (Narayev) is just a couple towns southeast of Lvov, and you have a 
geneology for a disconnected branch that comes from Lvov (Lemberg) in
Galicia, with a Meshullam as the father and a daughter named Esther. These are 
not the same people of course, but could it be that &quot;Meshel&quot; is short for
Meshullam? Maybe they were in a branch of the family that had the name 
Meshullam in it. There seem to be quite a number of descendants of Samuel and 
Tillie Kandel, since they had seven children.
     
Here are their children:
     
In the N.Y. County census of 1915 the following people are listed at 
54 E 3rd St. N.Y:
     
                      Age  Birthpl. Years in U.S.
Kandel,  Samuel       48    Austria 16
Kandel,  Tillie       45    Austria 16
&quot;        Joseph M.    26    Austria 16 
&quot;        Ester        17    Austria 16 
&quot;        Sarah        13    U.S.
&quot;        Benjamin     11      &quot;
&quot;        Issac         8      &quot; 
&quot;        Sylvia        6      &quot; 
&quot;        Meyer         3      &quot;

Hopefully this is helpful and connects somewhere to the Millers in Galicia.
     
BTW, is Miller too common a Jewish name to link up everyone with it into the 
same geneology?
     
Let me know if this links up somehow,

&gt;      Hi,
&gt;       There is the possibility of a connection. Do you know of any other
&gt;       Millers that you ARE related to? Not all Miller's are related, but the 
&gt;       family was extremely large and I do have many holes in the tree, so I

&gt;       do disagree though on your assumption that their parents were not in

&gt;       inconclusive. You do not know who supplied the info, or what their
&gt;       state of mind was at the time.
&gt;       Please keep me posted. Can I add this to my OTHER MILLER's list?

Moishe,
     
Actually, according to the US and NYC censuses, the only people living at 54 E 
3rd St. were Samuel and Tillie Kandel and their children. Also, the passenger list 
shows that only Tajbe Kandel and her son Jene (Joseph Martin) came together in 1901, 
which corresponds with the later census data showing that Joseph was the only child 
not born in the U.S. Apparently they lived at the same address until their deaths. 
So it seems likely that Meshel and Chaye Miller didn't immigrate after all.
Being that the Kandel family should be large (I don't know anything about the 
extended family) there might be other people who have some better infomation 
than I.
I believe that three was a Benjamin Kandel living on the same block on E 3rd St 
until at least the late 1970's. One other avenue I can pursue is to look at the 
other names in the Narayev Landmanschaft plot for Millers and see it they are 
related to Meshel Miller.
     
Please do include this geneology in your other Miller's list. List Samuel and 
Tillie Kandel and their children and maybe this will jog someone's memory out there. 
I'll try to find out more and keep you posted.
     
I believe that there is a Yizkor book for Narayev-Brezany but I haven't seen it.
Maybe this has some more Miller's in it too.
     
BTW, what Hebrew name do you think Meshel is short for? Meshullam, Moishe, or 
something else? That could be a good clue.
     
Thanks,
Ted Kandell

Moishe,
     
The copy of Tillie (Miller) Kandel's death certificate clearly says &quot;Meshel 
Miller&quot;.
What would Mechel be a diminutive for? Mikhuel? And what would be the Yiddish 
diminutive for Meshullam? I could be that the &quot;Yiddish&quot; double for Mesullam 
might be &quot;Misha&quot; in the same way that all Hebrew names were paired with a &quot;Yiddish&quot; 
(German,Polish or Russian) second name, like Dov Ber, Lazer Wolf, or Shraga Feivel, 
because of the legal prohibition against having an &quot;official&quot; Hebrew name. So Meshullam 
might be &quot;Meshullam Misha&quot; or something like that. I just have never heard the 
name Meshullam as part of a traditional name-pair, so I don't know what the pair 
would be. Do you think that the name Meshullam is sufficiently rare to increase the 
likelyhood of a relationship (no proof of course)?

My late grandmother, Mariossel (Mary) Thal Miller (or as you note, 
Muller) came from Rokishok (Rokiskis) in Lithuania, near the Latvian 
border. There is seemingly an obscure reference to her father, 
&quot;M.(endel) Muller on the Rokishok site in the Jewish geneaology page. 
She emigrated to Vancouver BC and later to Bellingham, WA with my 
grandfather, Ariel Thal, who came from Skopishik (Skopiskis). Most of 
the Thal clan settled in Bellingham -- as well as did a number of other 
families from Skopishok.
     
Her brother -- Isaac (Izzy) Muller (Miller) emigrated to South Africa at 
some point and his last known whereabouts was Kimberly, South Africa in 
the early 50's. If you have any iedas about how we go about tracing him, 
I would very much appreciate it. By the way, I am very familiar with the 
unit of the Jewish Agency that specializes in the search for relatives 
as I was previously finance director of the Aliyah Department which 
funded this group. Mazal tov on your work and b'hatzlaa'cha!

     Moishe,
     
     I was so excited to find your website.
     
     I'm interested in tracing the lineage of my great-great-grandmother, 
     Fanny Miller. She lived in Indiana, was married to Sylvanus Cripe, and 
     had at least one child, Fay (or Faye). Fay married Marvin Stump, and 
     they had three children: Goldie Irene, Forrest Noble, and Helen Louise 
     (my grandmother). I believe the whole family lived in Elkhart County, 
     IN.
     
     Hope you have some information. I've only recently started tracing my 
     family, and after 31 years of being a (lapsed) Catholic inexplicably 
     and powerfully drawn to Judaism since childhood, I feel like I have 
     stumbled on something that might explain everything.
     
     Not that the scientific/intellectual part of me believes there would 
     be any biological basis to a feeling of kinship, but.... :)
     
     Thanks in advance for any help you can give me...

Dear Moishe,
     
    I found your web page on the Miller family through Jewish-gen, and I
would like to know whether any of my family information sounds familiar to 
you.
     
     My grandfather, Emanuel (Menachem Mendel) Adler , was born in Dibeve,
Ukraine, to Moishe and Yehudis Miller. (He kept his mother's name, Adler, 
for legal reasons.)   Moishe's parents were Menachem Mendel and Rachel 
Miller.  Moishe Miller's siblings included Avrohom, Pinchas, Yitzchak, Berel 
(?),  and one sister.  Moishe Miller had five children - my grandfather, 
Emanuel (Menachem Mendel); David; Sima; Rachel; and Selma.  To the best of 
my knowledge, they all lived in Dibeve until the Holocaust.
     
    From inspecting your web-site, I could not see a connection to your
family, however, in your &quot;Other Trees&quot; I noticed message #27, regarding 
Miller from Dibeve, which may be a connection.  I tried sending the author 
of that message an E-mail directly, but I didn't get a response.
     
    Please let me know if you have any information for me.  If not,  please
include this message in your &quot;Other Trees&quot;.
     
     
Thanks in advance,

Dear Moishe,
     
    Thanks for E-mailing me.  The Mendel Muller in the census record could
theoretically be my GGgrandfather, (Dibeva was originally a part of

him to have been married with children.  Do you have any more information?

Moishe,
     
Thank you for emailing me regarding the Miller family.  I was very impressed 
with your Website!  I'm a relative beginner at genealogy, having only been 
doing this for a year.  What I know is that my great-grandmother's name was 
Gussie Miller (one of her children's birth certificates indicates it was 
actually Chaya Gitel Muller--with an umlat).  She was born circa 1881 in 
Nemirov, Galicia.  Her parents' names were Pesach and Rifka/Rachel (maiden 
name unknown).  Gussie immigrated to NYC in the 1890s; she married Jacob 
Thaler (previously spelled Tahler) on 5 December 1903 in NYC.  They had 8 
children:
    Rachel (Rose) -- my grandmother; born 9 September 1904 in NYC; died 3
                                    November 1989 in the Bronx
    Pesach (Paul) -- born 16 March 1906; died 22 July 1976 
    Anne Ethel -- born circa 1908; died 18 August 1972 
    David -- born 1911; died September 1918
    Bessie (Betty) -- born circa 1912; died 4 July 1988 
    Rebecca (Rhea) -- born 11 March 1913; died 7 January 1994 
    Sarah (Sandy) -- born December 1915; still living
    Edith Yetta -- born 1 June 1920; still living
     
Gussie died on 28 June 1966 in NYC and is buried with her husband in the 
Brzezaner Young Men's Benevolent Association section in Mt. Zion Cemetery in 
Maspeth.
     
I took a cursory look at your Miller information and did not see any 
connection.  If you believe that there may be a link, please let me know. 
If you need additional information about the children, I can provide that. 
Incidentally, all of the children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren of 
Gussie and Jacob have formed a &quot;Cousins Club&quot; and try to get together a 
couple times a year in the NYC area.
     
Hope this was helpful.

Moishe,

All I know about my g-g-grandfather Pesach Muller is that he lived in
Nemirov, Galicia.  He and his wife had three children:  Sholem, Meyer, and
Chaje Gitel (Gussie) who was my great grandmother.  According to Gussie's
1903 NYC marriage certificate, her mother's maiden name was Ruchel Millar
(with an &quot;a&quot;).  I don't know if this was a clerical error--it seems like too
much of a coincidence.  The children immigrated to NYC while their parents
remained behind in Europe.  I'm assuming Pesach died by 1906 because Gussie
and her husband had a son born in this year who was named after him.

Does any of this sound familiar?  Do you know where to write for records
from Nemirov?

Regards,

Deborah Peskin

        Shalom!  I found your web site rather interesting, as I also have a
Miller branch in my tree.  I can only go back to the mid 1800's, but do not have
the town/shtetl name.  The earliest Miller I have is Mordecai, all that is
known is he was from Poland.  He had 5 children, Jacob, William, Leo, Ruth,

brothers, my be she was my father's first wife that was killed in the 
Holocaust.

I found the lone survivor from my family, now living in Israel. His name 
is Yosef Massbaum and he lives at:
Rechov Hamavdil 19
Ramat Gan Israel 52562

He told me of his aunt, Miriam Miller, married to Binyomin Gottleib of 
Grybow. 
They had 2 girls and a boy (in that order), all of whom perished in the 
Holocaust. 
If you speak with him, please provide ANY other information he relates to 
you.

In a few weeks, my website will be updated to include this info. Once 
again, it is at:

Hello Moshe Miller
My name is Yael Kaniel.  I live in Israel.  My brother, Naftuli Hetzky
(Norman) told me that he met with you and Louis Schonfeld this week -
just the day after I returned to Israel from a visit to the family in
NY.  As my brother suggested, I checked your website and was very
impressed.  I have been working on ours for quite a while and about 90%
of it is already in the computer at Dorot in the Museum of the Diaspora,
Tel-Aviv.

Because we have a Miller in the family, the connection to Nyirbator,
Hungary jumped out at me.  My father's (Z&quot;L) family -Goldner from his
father and Rezmuves from his mother - came from Nyirbator where my
father grew up.  Avraham David (from Nyirbator), my father's maternal
grandfather, married Lea Bash (possibly of some connection to the writer
of &quot;Megaleh Amukot&quot;).  One of their daughters married Alexander Miller
and went to live in Zsibo.  Of their seven children, two survived -Moshe
and Baruch.  Baruch married Lea, had 9 children and lived in Meah
Shearim in Jerusalem till they moved to Brooklyn about 35 years ago.
Both Moshe and Baruch have since passed away.

I noticed you were looking for a Bluma Zipkin, so being in Israel, I
chacked the phone book for Tel-Aviv.  There is no Zipkin (or Sipkin)
listed at all.  I also checked with directory information and was told
the same.  They did find, however, Allen and Dvora Zipkin in Jerusalem
and a Harry Zipkin in the Smadar Hotel in Cesarea.  What I suggest you
do about Bluma is contact the &quot;Misrad Hapnim&quot; (Ministry of Interior)
here with the last known details to see if she had changed her name to
something Hebrew as many people do (we were Klein) or changed through
marriage.

My brother's oldest son is Zvi Elimelech, which you said is popular in
your tree.  I'll ask him about it. This probably came from his wife's
tree - Silver.

Shalom,

Hi,
thank you for your letter.
My father Shlomo or Shani, was born in Coshize (slovakia) at 1916,
His Father name was Menashe Miller (Or Muller)
Menahe's father name was Zeilig.
The names Zelig, Shlomo, Rozi and more that I found in your fantastic web 
site are also in my family.
I know that Menashe (My grandfather) was very young when his father Zelig 
died, may be - at 1890.
Menahe was born to his father when he was old man, to his second wife. All 
his brothers and sisters were from Zelig's first wife.
To make it shortly, we are &quot;LEVI&quot;, so it is very easy to check if ther is 
any connection between our families.
My father Z&quot;L, told us that ALL Miller (or Muller) who are LEVI - are 
relatives

Thank you again, And I hope any way to hear from you,
I am sorry about my English

	Aharon

Hi,
Thanks for your letter and the details you provided. We are from the tribe 
of Yissochur, not Levi, so we are not related through the Miller side, 
unless it was originally from a great-grandmother's side of the family in 
your branch. On our side, it was always Miller, since 1780's.
Drishat Shalom!

    My name is Don Iskowitz.  My father Chaim Shmuel was born in Dibrova
(Dubovje} currently in Ukraine (48' 00&quot;-23' 50&quot;) about 5.2 miles NNW of the
Romanian City of Sighet in the county of Maramures, in March of 1913.  His
mother was Faiga Shandel Muller and married my grandfather Mordcha
(Mordechai) Isaacovitch prior to 1908.  Faiga's father and several brothers
owned and operated an orchard farm in Dibrova.  My father came to Ellis
Island with his mother in Oct-Nov 1921, possibly on the SS Rotterdam 
leaving
from Antwerp Belgium, and settled in New York's &quot;Lower East Side&quot; where his
father had preceded them in 1913. He had gone AWOL while home on leave from
the &quot;Jewish Brigade&quot; of the Emperor Franz Josef of Austia-Hungary. I have a
picture of him at 23 years old in his uniform with a &quot;Star Of David&quot; on his
collar. Faiga and he were born around 1887. The extended family spoke 
Yiddish
and Hungarian at home and most were observant Chassidim.
My father was the youngest of three children to be born in Dibrova 
(referred
to  as Dubveh in Letter #27 and Dibeve in Letter #42) but the only child to
survive long enough to reach America.  His parents had five more children 
in
America, two boys (the older born in 1924, and for the benefit of Eric 
Miller
author #27 is named Yitzchok Isaac also) and three girls, one who died a
child.                                      The five surviving adult 
children
of Mordcha and Shandel (who died and is buried in Queens, NY in 1931 gave
them 14 grandchildren (of which I am one).  Those 14 produced 25
greatchildren so far, and those 25 have so far have given life to 6
great-great grandchildren.  The youngest born 5 days ago in New Jersey.
            I'm just getting started in my research and will be 
interviewing
my deceased fathers siblings and cousins for further information.  No doubt
their information will be  invaluable.  Until then if you can be of any 
help
it will certainly be appreciated and treasured.
                                    Thank you for your web page and please
post this letter in your &quot;Other Trees&quot; section.     Don Iskowitz,  Pompano

Stumbled upon your interesting web page recently.
 
I have had no luck in tracing my MILLER roots previous to the U.S. 
census of 1900. Most of the relatives are gone and how often I 
chide myself for never showing any interest as a young person when 
my father would relate stories which would be invaluable to my 
genealogical endeavers. At any rate this is what I know: My 
grandfather Abraham MILLER emigrated from Russia about 1890 
probably with his wife, Ida. My father Harry was born in NYC in 
1897 and his sister, Rose was born a year later. Abraham died in 
Philadelphia in 1910. My father and his sister moved to and 
remained in Philadelphia. My father married Rose LANE and his 
sister married Manfred LAPAYOWKER.
 
I doubt that I will "connect" with anyone but anyway it's worth a 
try.

My mother's mother was Gitle (Geezla) Froieda Miller (Gertrude or Gussie
in America).  She came to America approx 1906 with her husband Motle
Novodworsky and other N. family members and lived in Brooklyn.  Their
last residence in Russia was in Kishinev, but we believe they may hae
had earlier connections in the Minsk/Grodno area.  Gitle's mother was
Anna Petiler (possibly from Kolomia) and her father was Solomon Miller. 
Gitle's siglings were Clara, nat, Bluma and Esther.  Anna (my great gm)
lived to over 100 and died in the Brooklyn Hebrew Home and Hospital for
then Aged.


Anything familiar?

Hi, My name is Mitchell R. Miller and my father was Arthur Clayton Miller 
and he claimed roots from Cambria County Pennsylvania. We have not been 
able to find any of his relatives. We think he was born sometime between 
1865 and 1890. My mother traveled to Johnstown,Pa. in the early 60's and 
we think she found some people that knew him. He was married before and 
his wife and baby were supposed to have died in childbirth. My oldest 
brother was named Earl Franklin Miller, the next son was Arthur Glenn 
Miller. We have reason to believe that he was of Jewish descent as the 
military placed the star of David on his tombstone, military records are 
destroyed. He spoke French and served in WW I. If you think any of these 
pieces might fit into your research, I would really like to hear from you. 
My dad passed away in 1956 and we have been trying to fine some link for 
many years. 
 
Thank you,
 
Mitchell R. Miller

dear moishe
 
while watching my son surfing,i saw he had come to your website and your 
name struck me in an instant,for it is the name of my mother's great 
grandfather,so maybe there is a connection. i have not been able to get 
through to the records of vilkamir in lithuania to find out more of our 
roots.
 
my mother was a born miller born in oudtshoorn south africa in l9l0.her 
father came out to cape town alone and left his wife CHANA born sheigam 
from janeva lithuania and  four sons sons ,.it took him five years to save 
enough money to send for them to join him in cape town.after a few years 
two more sons were born to them twins this time alex and jos.
 
then in quick succession three daughters were born after the family had 
moved to oudtshoorn becky,rachel(my mother) and sarah the only surviving 
sibling stil living in johannesburg 89 years old now.
 
the oldest son simon had a departmental store in the town for many years 
he had five children louis,harold,the only daughter) reggie,meyer and natie,
harold still living in cape town and the youngest son natie living in england.
 
the second son cecil had four sons sam,harry,arthur and bokkie,bokkie is the 
only survivung one and living in johannesburg
 
the third son morris had three sons hymie who came to israel in l948 and has 
remained here ever since,davy who lived in bloemfontein who passed away recently 
and bennie who still lives in cape town.
 
the fourth son raphael had three sons and a daughter, jack who lives in port 
elizabeth s.a. abe who lived in toronto canada, deceased,aarie who lives in 
jerusalem and haddassah also of jerusalem,
 
alex had two children one still in cape town and a son now of haifa israe l .mary 
and sydney.
 
jos who came on aliyah with his parents and lived in ashkelon and later in nathanya
where his two sons live to this day.menashe and benzy
 
becky whose son lives in johannesburg and a daughter who lives is ashdod israel
richard and .doreen
rachel who had four children a son living in london a daughter living in israel and a 
son and daughter living in calgary canada.
issy minnie judy and len
sarah who son lives in london and daughter living in bloemfontein.goldie and mannie.
 
there  were 28 grandchildren born to chana and mordechai peretz miller and i do not know 
how many great grandchildren.
 
while mordechai peretz came to s.a. to make his fortune,his father benjamin and his two 
brothers simon and tuvia came to palestine,they owned a pardessand part of it was donated 
to the state and became the campus of the weitzman institute for this effort the eldest 
son was invited to be the first president of the new little state and being a very modest 
man and not wishing to be in the limelight he refused this honour.
 
many years a go a cousin came to israel on a visit and as all the offspring do,went to the 
cemetary at rehovot israel to visit the graves of our grandoparents. she also saw the graves 
of the three brothers,simon,tuvia and mordechai perez and their father,benjamin and of course 
on HIS tombstone was the name of his father,MOISHE MILLER. they all came from lithuania from 
a little town called then vilkamir near vilnius the capital,
 
i don't know if we are connected to you but the name was the same and it took my fancy,maybe 
there are other Millers floating around who may be interested and have other stories to tell,
i really wanted to go back a few more generations if anyone had information more than is at 
present in my  possession.
 
hope to hear from you or read more about ourselves in your website.lehitraot

Hello fellow Miller Family in Ukraine researchers !
    My Miller family is from Sambor, Austria-Hungary now in the Ukraine. 
Isaac Miller  & Hannah (nee) Limmer imigrated to the US about 1890 ( NYC then 
about 1900 to Buffalo,NY)   Before then for nearly 500 years my Miller family 
lived on a farm in or near Sambor. Take a look at my family info and see if 
there might be a connection.
