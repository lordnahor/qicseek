BibGene is a
<a href="http://www.santafe.edu/~vince/MacBibTeX.html">BibTeX</a>-compatible 
Macintosh application for maintaining databases of references to scientific 
papers.  BibGene was designed 
to maintain BibTeX information in a cross-linked object-oriented 
format which makes it easier to detect and correct common mistakes such as 
multiple spellings of an author's or journal's name.
BibGene also provides a way to store information that does not fit well into 
the BibTeX framework, such as citations from one paper to another, pointers 
to online preprints, and author addresses.

<p>BibGene is available as freeware for PowerPC-based Macintosh computers.

I am not currently supporting 68K-based Macs,
but <A HREF="68k.html">an older unsupported 68K version of BibGene is
available</A>.

A <a href="about.html">brief BibGene user manual</a>
is online.  For examples of BibGene databases,
and of BibTeX and HTML exported by BibGene,
see my <a href="/~eppstein/bibs/">bibliography page</a>.

BibGene is based on <a href="/~eppstein/gene/">Gene</a>, a shareware
genealogy database program.  For more detailed information about the
user interface features shared by Gene and BibGene, or on the file
format they use to store their data, see the documentation available
from the <A HREF="/~eppstein/gene/">Gene home page</A>.
