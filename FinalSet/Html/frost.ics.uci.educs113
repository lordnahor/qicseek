<h3>Ground rules</h3>
<UL>
<LI>Your grade will be based mostly
     on your team's accomplishments, which are primarily the
     design document, the delivered game, and the final presentation.
     <!--You will also create a small game individually.-->
     No quizzes, tests, or final exam.
     Usually all team members get the same grade for the team game.

<LI> <b>If</b> you add the course after Jan. 9, or if you do not fill out and turn
in the Team Information Form,
or if you drop from your team and do not find another team,
<b>then</b>
you will not be able to work on a team and the
best possible grade you can get for the course will be a B.
</UL>

<p>

Attendance at lecture period is required on certain days with student or
guest speakers:
<ul>
<li> Tuesday, Jan. 14: team announcements and first team meetings

	 choice is to use the
	 <a href="http://frost.ics.uci.edu/Ucigame/Ucigame-20120229/">Ucigame</a> framework.
	 You can use any language and/or library; run anything exotic by Prof. Frost first.
-->

<li> Third individual assignment: six weekly status reports,
	 due Mondays of sixth through Finals weeks.

<P>


<LI> The major part of the course is a project, to be completed by a team.
The project will be to design and implement substantial portions of
a computer game.
The project consists of the following:
<OL>
<LI> A statement of team composition.  Name the students on the team,
     the grade option of each student, the major of each student,
     the team name, brief descriptions of two ideas you are considering
     for the team's game, and the time and place your team will meet
     for three hours every week.
     If you plan to work with students from <!--LCAD, or anyone--> outside
     of the class, please mention that as well.
     Send by email to <i>eugenia.g@uci.edu</i>.
     <b>Wednesday, 1/15/2014, by noon.</b>
     Put "CS 113/Inf 125" at the start of the email's subject line.
<LI> A draft design document for the game.  This should be between
     20 and 40 pages in length.  It should be on the World Wide Web
     in HTML or PDF format (or another format that permits scrolling
     through the entire document).
     <!-- Google Docs fine, a wiki is not, you lose the order and it's
          more convenient for the reader to have all in one scrollable doc. -->
     Due <b>Wednesday, 1/29/2014</b> (by the end of the day).
     Email the URL of your draft to Prof. Frost.
     Structure your Design Doc based on
     <a href="DesignDoc.html">our recommended Design Doc structure</a>.
<LI> A presentation, or "pitch," of the team's game idea
     in the fifth or sixth week of the class <b>Tuesday, 2/4/2014</b>,
     or <b>Thursday, 2/6/2014</b>, or <b>Tuesday, 2/11/2014</b>,
<LI> A final design document for the game.  This should be about
     30 to 40 pages in length.  In addition to describing the game,
     technologies, art, and game play in detail,
     it should describe the specific responsibilities
     of each team member.
     <b>Due Wednesday, 2/12/2014.</b>  This is also on the web,
     and the URL should be emailed to Prof. Frost.
<LI> A presentation of the game development status in eighth week - dates and times TBD.
<LI> A presentation of the game at the end of week 10 or in Finals Week.
	 <b>To be scheduled; each team will have 30 minutes.</b>
     Your team's grade will be based
     on the game as of this presentation.
<LI> A completion document, which includes an optional users manual,
     revised design document,
     individual statements about the course of the project (optional), and a
     CD with source code, executables, art and
     music files, a video of the game being played, and at least two screen shots.
     <b>Due at final presentation.</b>
<LI> Participation in the CS 113/Informatics 125 Open House, held during
     the course's Final Exam period, <b>Tuesday, 3/18/2014 4:00-6:00pm</b>.

<h3>Scoring and grading</h3>

Grading will be on a straight scale, based on total points.
(A+ 97.0 or higher;
A  93.0 to 96.9;
A- 90.0 to 92.9;
B+ 87.0 to 89.9;
B  83.0 to 86.9;
B- 80.0 to 82.9; and so on.)

<p>

Each game project will receive a letter grade, e.g.
A, A-, B+, B (these are by far the most common grades).
The game project is worth at most 75 points, as follows:
A+, 73 to 75; A, 71; A-, 68; B+, 65; B, 62; and so on.

<p>
The game design document (including pitch and 8th
week status reports) is worth up to 10 points; most teams
will get 9 (an A).

<p>
Individual accomplishments are worth up to 15 points:

<blockquote>
<!--
3 - Individual game (0: none; 1-2: very partial; 3: nice game; 4: excellent &mdash; extra credit)
<br>
-->
5 - attendance (roll will be taken on six or more dates)
<br>
2 - comment on another team's draft design document
<br>
2 - attendance at and energy demonstrated in eighth week presentation
<br>
6 - six status reports
</blockquote>

At the Computer Game Design Conference on May 6, 1998, there
was a panel on design docs.  Moderator Alex Dunne referenced a real
design document which was submitted by panelist John Jack, a producer
at Monolith.  This design doc was from the company's recent computer
game, "Claw".
