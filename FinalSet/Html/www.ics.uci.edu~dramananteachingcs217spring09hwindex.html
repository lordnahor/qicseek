1. For math problems/derivations, show intermediate work.<br>
2. For programming problems, hand in code as well as any plots/output
illustrating its functionality.<br>
3. You are responsible for making handwritten solutions legible and straightforward to follow.
</p>

You can hand in homework in one of two ways:
<p> 1. <b> Hard-copy submission </b> <br>

Submit a hard-copy by the start of class on the due date. 
</p>

<p> or </p>

<p> 2. <b> Electronic submission </b> <br>
Submit an electronic copy into the appropriate homework folder in the
EEE dropbox. If you are handing in more than one file, please zip or
