<h2>About QQ Skeleton</h2>
Name:Tristen Reinhart<br>
E-mail: <code>eapu399@ea.oac.uci.edu</code><br>
Major: political science
<p>
Three neat Web finds:
<ol>
<li>One intersting thing that I found was the different programs that 
I can log onto to find information.  First, galaxy has an 
unlimited amount of information from politics to computers to 
sports.  IO also found thye yahoo which also has a lot of 
information from various universities and oither schools of 
thought.
<li> THe second intersting thing I found was the ability to log onto 
various television progams- such as the Late Night with David 
Letterman monologues.
 <li>The third aspect of the web that I found intersting was the 
homepages that are developed for each individual piece of information.  
After seeing what takes place in class to make a program, iI appreciate 
more the information that is presented. #3. </ol>

<LI><A NAME"QQ1"><B>explain the process of cashe and why us it so 
important</B></A><br> My answer is when one is working with several Web 
documents at once, and one wants to keep lookig at just one or two of 
them, it takes too much time to find the document, make the connection, 
and then download the page.  This is where<a 
href="http://galaxy.einet.net/cgi-bin/wais-html-multi"> cache</a> is 
useful.  Cache 
keeps the last few documents in memory, reloads them instantly when one 
requests it. <a 
href="http://akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo/Computers/World_Wide_Web/Caching/"> 
Mosaic</a> checks locally to see if it is there before sending 
the HTTP to  requests it.  THis is very useful because one can run multiple 
windows of the program while being able to browze at the same time,  and  
one does not have to separate all windows from each other.

<LI><A NAME="QQ2"><B>who is the governor of Texas and why is he so important</B></A><br>
My answer is Governor Bush.  The reasons why he is so important is 
because not only is he former President Bush's son, but he was also to 
beat a major Texan, former governor, Ann Richardson.  She was known 
throughout Texan, and she also received a major endorsement form Ross 
Perot.  As it is well known, Ross <a 
href="gopher://gopher.tamu.edu/11/.dir/polsci.dir/">Perot</a> 
was a contender against President 
George Bush in the last Presidential race.  Governor Bush has also 
shown that there are still political alignments going on at all times.  
Maybe Governor Bush will be a future <a 
href="gopher://ftp.std.com/11/nonprofits/ICRN/orgs/rnc">Presidential</a> 
, or vice presidential contender....

<LI><A NAME="QQ3"><B>what is markup language</B></A><br>
My answer is actually more <a 
href="http://www.pcweek.ziff.com/~eamonn/crash_course.html">simple 
</a>than I originally thought.  <a 
href="http://gnn.com/cgi-bin/imagemap/HOME?72,96">Mark up</a> 
is the act of inserting additional text into a document which is not 
usually visible to the reader nor is it part on the context.  Mark up 
enhances the document  in some way  such as capturing the document 
structure or adding references to the additional list - also known as 
tags....

<LI><A NAME="QQ4"><B>who is the dean of social sciences and what is his background </B></A><br>
My answer is the <a href="http://www.socsci.uci.edu/">dean</a> of social 
scienes is professor William R. 
Schonfeld.  His number is for undergraduate counseling is (714) 824-6803 
and his number for graduate counseling is (714) 824-5924.  He is a 
political science professor who received his Ph. D at <a 
href="http://www.socsci.uci.edu/pol/personnel/schonfeld/schonfeld.htm">Princeton</a> 
University.   if one needs to get in touch with him electronically, his 
e-mail address is wrschonf@ci.edu  <p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to 
list of questions.</it></a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ5"><B>how can the Library of Congress help me do research for my political science classes</B></A><br>
My answer is not a very simple one.  I tried to look at many resources 
and what I found was the the world Wide Web has a number of <a 
href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/govdocs.html">resources</a> 
that have direct information on the library of Congress, political 
elections and much more information.  For example, the first link that I 
found was through<a href="http://akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo/Government/"> 
yahoo</a>- it is an index on the federal government 
information on the Internet, also a Comprehensive government resourse.
