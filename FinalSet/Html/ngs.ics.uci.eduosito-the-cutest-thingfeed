		<description><![CDATA[Last time when I was at your place and saw Rashi waiting for you, that reminded me how Osito used to do -- very similar.  Their sizes are different, but affectionate nature seems to be the same. 
Unfortunately Osito is not going to be there -- worse, Sudha is also not coming.

I am eager to meet you and hear your talk.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[He is absolutely adorable...

Rashi is not quite as cute, but still stops traffic wherever we go...  Folks want to know where we got a &quot;black ridgeback.&quot;  Even when folks don&#039;t ask me directly, they point at her and whisper.  I&#039;ve also got my &quot;standard answers&quot; that I must have repeated a thousand times.

Osito is really something!  His personality really comes through in these photos.  Bring him to Santa Barbara!]]></description>
