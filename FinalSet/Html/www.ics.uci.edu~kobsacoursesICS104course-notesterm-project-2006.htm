The  project should be carried out by pairs of two students, one being the &quot;experimenter&quot; and  the other  the &quot;test user&quot; or &quot;subject&quot;. The   result of the project is a written report  that describes how the test  user interacted with these interfaces to solve given tasks, as well as  the  interface design and information    organization problems that you  encountered thereby.  The term papers are due  by <B>December   8 at 11:59pm</B> at the latest (to be uploaded electronically in the ICS 104   dropbox). The estimated work time per person is one hour for the experiment,   2-3 hours for analyzing   the interface, and less than a day for   writing the report.</FONT></P><P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This project will be conducted    in collaboration with the UCI libraries which also supplied  the  tasks. The library will be very eager to read your findings.</font></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><FONT SIZE="4"><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Tasks:&nbsp; </FONT></B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif">See          the separate sheet of instructions for the experimenter that will be      distributed in class. Experimenters should <em>not</em> share these instructions      with the subjects beforehand.</FONT></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" SIZE="4">  </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" SIZE="4"><B>How to proceed:</B> </FONT></P><UL>  <LI><font size="4" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">You will need paper      and a pen for the experimenter to take notes. If you have a voice recorder      (e.g. cassette recorder, voice recording software on your computer) that    can record for about an hour, this would also be useful.</font></LI>  <LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" SIZE="4">One student is the      test user who should solve the given tasks <em>alone</em>.</FONT></LI>  <LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" SIZE="4">The other  is      the experimenter who notes down all important actions/comments of the user,      specifically when the user has problems.</FONT></LI>  <LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" SIZE="4">This user should <I>think         aloud</I>, i.e. explain permanently whatever s/he is currently doing         and why, and whatever comes to his or her mind. A fictitious example         would         be: &quot;Now         I need to find the books by Peter Norvig. I look for a way to         enter his name     in a search field. However, I cannot find one. Let us browse through         these pulldown-menus to figure out how this can be done....&quot;</FONT></LI>  <LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" SIZE="4">When the user is done      with all tasks,      both partners should re-analyse the problems that the user encountered      and      document       them with screenshots.</FONT></LI>  <LI><font size="4" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">If you have suggestions      for improvements, also note them down (suggesting improvements is not very      important though).</font></LI>  <LI><font size="4" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Write a report of about      12 single-spaced pages (8 pages of text plus 4 pages of screendumps). It      will be graded based on</font>    <ul>      <li><font size="4" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">the clarity of          the description of what the user did and what problems s/he encountered</font></li>      <li><font size="4" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">the thoughtfullness          of your analysis of why these problems occurred</font></li>      <li><font size="4" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">the thoughtfulness          of your recommendations for improvement (less important)</font></li>    </ul>  </LI>  <LI><font size="4" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Upload your report      electronically by Dec.    8 at 11:59pm the ICS 104 dropbox.</font></LI></UL><P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" SIZE="4"><B>Some advice:</B></FONT></P><UL>   <LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" SIZE="4">Do not hesitate to      speak  out everything that comes to your mind. You do not have to be a      brilliant     user. This project is not about you, but about the interface. As many of      you  already experienced, even the brightest users encounter problems if      the user     interface is not well designed.</FONT></LI>  <LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" SIZE="4">I    plan to forward your reports to the UCI library, so that they can decide      on necessary improvements. Please therefore criticizewhatever you find problematic with the interface, but do it politely (and    do not blame the programmers :-). Do not include your student IDs in your      report. If you tell me so, I will leave out your names whenforwarding your report.</FONT></LI>  <LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" SIZE="4">Recording the user's comments on tape is useful for later analyzing usability problems.      This is not required though.</FONT></LI>  <LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif" SIZE="4">Your criticism and recommendations should be based on HCI and web design guidelines      presented in class (but you are welcome to also present a few personal      opinions that are      not      grounded      in HCI theory).</FONT></LI>  </UL> </BODY></HTML>
