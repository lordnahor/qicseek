We arrived a couple hours later than we intended, after having been stopped on I-5<br>
in Camp Pendleton for two hours due to a police standoff with the "$2 bill" bank robber.<br>
Our return trip wasn't any quicker: we got a flat tire just outside Oceanside.<br>
Fortunately the Rychnovskys had arrived earlier and secured a fine campsite for us.
