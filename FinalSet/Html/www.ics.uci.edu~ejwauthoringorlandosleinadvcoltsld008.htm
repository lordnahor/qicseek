1. It�s the owner of the target, not the owner of the reference, who cares about the secrecy of the target�s location.
</UL><UL>
But putting a constraint at the target would mean:
<UL>
A header for use with PUT, MKCOL, MKREF
<BR><BR>An ineffective attempt to control creation of references on other servers
</UL></UL><UL>
But, if the location is really secret, the only person who could create a reference to it is its owner.  So there is some use to providing an option at reference creation time to hide the location of the target.  In the real world there will be people other than the owner who know of the existence of the location and may create references to it.
</UL><UL>
2. It�s more complexity for the server.  In general, the server is required to return Ref-Target with every response on a direct reference.  But if we have an option to hide the location, the server must check before every response whether to return Ref-Target or not.</UL> </P>
