<p> Your writeup should be in a file like this called
<tt>index.html</tt>. 

</p><p> You can see that I've limited the width of the template webpage to
650 pixels.  Please make sure your inlined images fit within this
limit so that the page can be printed.  There is no limit on the size
of images that you link to.

</p><p> Answer your questions using an ordered list
(<tt>&lt;ol&gt;...&lt;/ol&gt;</tt>):

</p><ol>

<p></p><li> Here is my answer to the first question.  I need to show
puppies...

<p><a href="http://vision.bc.edu/%7Edmartin/teaching/cs342/2007f/hw/template/fig1.jpg"><img src="template_files/fig1.jpg" width="500"></a>

</p><p>...and kittens:

</p><p><a href="http://vision.bc.edu/%7Edmartin/teaching/cs342/2007f/hw/template/fig2.jpg"><img src="template_files/fig2.jpg" width="500"></a>

</p><p>I've set the width of each image manually so that it fits on the page,
but I also have the image linked to the high resolution version.  
If the source images are small enough, just show them at their native
resolution without specifying width or height:

</p><p><img src="template_files/fig3.jpg">

</p><p></p></li><li> Here is my answer to the second question, which is in 3 parts.  You
can put one ordered list inside another for situations like this:
<ol type="a">
<p></p><li> First part...
<p></p></li><li> Second part...
<p></p></li><li> Third part.
</li></ol>

</li></ol>
