		<description><![CDATA[Sounds very promising... just wish it would happen sooner rather than later! All these new technologies promoting &quot;green&quot; (http://www.pressportal.com.au/news/120/) and such technologies. Do you think we&#039;re concentrating on things that are not relevant? Shouldn&#039;t we be applying our knowledge elsewhere? Why can we enforce rapid change? Such as in the automotive industry to promote faster growth, safer and cleaner cars. I think we should be concentrating on our resources and the future generations problems to come!!]]></description>
