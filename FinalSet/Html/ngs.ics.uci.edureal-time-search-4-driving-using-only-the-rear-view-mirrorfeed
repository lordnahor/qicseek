		<description><![CDATA[My partner Evelyne introduced me to your blog and I must say that I like it...
What you say about your colleagues is typical of human behaviour generally. There are those who are early adopters of new ideas and those who won&#039;t get on the bus until it&#039;s full to overflowing...

I think that it may be connected to an aversion to change. Most folks do not like change and will do almost anything to maintain the status quo. For status quo read safety. Change is of itself a scary thing which is interesting in a world where the pace of change is getting ever faster.  



Enjoy your early adopter advantage as you&#039;re ahead of the curve....
