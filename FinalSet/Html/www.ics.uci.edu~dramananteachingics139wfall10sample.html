    <h1>Writing Sample</h1>

    <h2> Dates: Monday Sept 28 and Wednesday Sept 30 </h2>

    <p> We will have two in-class writing samples on the above dates. The topic for each sample will be something designed to be easy to write about, so you can concentrate on your writing rather than the underlying ideas. In the class period, we will ask you to write roughly 300 words (for comparison, this page contains nearly 600 words); this should give you plenty of time to revise and rewrite your passage. To pass, your writing must have essentially perfect mechanics, grammar, and usage, and it must be reasonably clear and well organized. You may bring a dictionary or any other reference works. Being able to produce clear and correct writing is a requirement for completing lower division writing, so we expect everyone in the class to be able to demonstrate this ability.
