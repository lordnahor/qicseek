<H2>CompSci 260 - Fundamentals of the Design and Analysis of Algorithms - Winter, 2013 (Dillencourt)</H2>

<p>The homework problems, while highly recommended, are optional.
Some of the problems are straightforward, others are a bit more challenging.
They are intended to help you learn the material by applying it.
This works if you make a serious attempt to solve them.
If instead of trying to solve them yourself you prefer to ignore them, 
obtain solutions from a friend, or look them up on the internet, 
that is your choice.</p>  


<p>Homework will not be collected or graded.  
Selected solutions will be discussed in the discussion sections.
The assignments will be posted here.
