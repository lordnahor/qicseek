Those dealing seriously with large volumes of data and software technology
are continually seeking improvements.  Issues affecting "quality of
results" are paramount as data volumes continue to grow, and opportunities
to address data quality issues abound.  Algorithms designed for complex
data including more powerful sampling strategies, dimension reduction
techniques, the ability to handle numerical and textual data, and the
effective use of heuristics to speed results will be key to distilling vast
data into quality information / knowledge / wisdom.   Examples from
genomics illustrate many of the important issues.
