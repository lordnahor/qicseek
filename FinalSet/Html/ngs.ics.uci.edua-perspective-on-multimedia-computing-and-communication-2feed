		<description><![CDATA[Yes very interesting read. This is true with Twitter. I am excited and hoping that this trend stays for a while. It will be interesting to see people have the ability to communicate without being censored, for the most part. What if people start to turn to this application for their news instead of the regular old news. I think they might be enlightened to what is really going on in this world and that will be good. 
On another note, think about medical knowledge. This is the first time in the history of man where anyone who has internet access, has access to a medical school. In the past you had to trust your doctor. Now you can research and communicate medical knowledge over the net. Can&#039;t wait to see what the internet will bring next.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi,

Thanks for the very interesting read, it is impressive just how far we&#039;ve come. With the new online media communication seems to be taking many different forms, I do wonder what is coming next. Twitter microblogging seems to facilitate a faster spread of information than has typically been seen before, the fact that anyone can do it at any time very easily almost has the power to change the way we receive news. It takes away some of the emphasis on big news corporations, allowing anyone to tell the world what is going on, I think this may be a new frontier for communications.

Regards,

Darryl]]></description>
