<LI><A NAME="QQ1"><B>My roomate is talking about doing a designer drug
called "ecstacy" for the first time with some of her "friends".  I want
her to be informed about the substance;  So, where can I find a personal
account of the effects and overall experiences related to the
drug?</B></A><br>
<p>On the <A HREF="http://webcrawler.cs.washington.edu/WebCrawler/Home.html">
Web Crawler Home Page</A>, type in "DRUGS" for a list of references
related to the topic of drugs.  On that list is an extensively researched
and extremely informative piece of work called <A
HREF="http://hyperreal.com/drugs/e4x/"> "E is for Ecstasy"</A> by Nicholas
Saunders.  Everything on would ever need to know about the drug ecstacy
(MDMA), is detailed in this document.  Tis includes a history of the
substance, explanations of what it is, what it does, how it works, where  
it comes from, who takes it and why, where to get it, and legal issues
involved.  Among the information in this report is an indepth description
of the authors personal experiences of taking ecstacy, as well as
experiences of friends and aquaintances.  There are also suggestions for
first time users, which give tips on how to ensure a safe and optimally
satisfying first time experience.

<LI><A NAME="QQ2"><B>I am distressed because I'm finding that the quizes 
are very difficult.  Consequently, I'm not doing very well on them.  How 
can I study for the final so that I don't fail?</B><br>
On the <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/">ICS 1C Home Page</A>, 
click on <A 
HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/schedule.html">                     
"schedule."</A>  Move to the bottom of this page, and you will see a 
listing for each one of the quizes in ICS 1C.  The information provided 
there is a copy of each of the questions on the quiz you choose, along 
with the answers.  By studying the answers to the quizes, you may get a 
better idea of what Dr. Franklin is looking for in terms of answers on 
future quizes.  Furthermore, if you study each quiz very carefully you 
may be able to do quite well on the final, even though you did not do 
well on the quizes themselves.  This is because much of the information 
covered on the quizes is very likely to show up on the final.

<LI><A NAME="QQ3"><B>I'll be traveling around the nation and the world 
this summer.  I really like to attend rave parties, where they play House 
and Techno music.  Since it is hard to find these parties, and you 
ususally have to know someone to find out where the good ones are, how 
can I find out where to go for these parties while I'm on the road?</B><br>

The "RAVE" scene has it's own listing on the world wide web!  This seems 
amazing, since most of these parties are illegal.  In order to find out 
where the party is in any part of the U.S. or many parts of Eastern 
Europe, just use the <A 
HREF="http://204.62.130.120/~eric/dblist.html">Global Rave Information 
Database</A>.  From there, you can select any region where Raves are 
happening, including San Francisco, L.A., Chicago, New York, the U.K., 
and Germany.  After selecting the desired region, you can click on "view" 
and you will get a list of all the up and comming rave parties in the 
area.  So, no matter where you are, you will be able to find out where a 
rave is, as long as you can access the world wide web.

<LI><A NAME="QQ4"><B>I am enrolled in a Physics class which is a study of 
the earth's atmosphere.  For my term report, I want to include some kind 
of picture of the earth, with emphasis on the atmosphere.  Where can I 
find such a picture?</B><br>

On the <A HREF="http://www.sgi.com/">Silicon Graphics Home Page</A>, 
there are a wide variety of graphics resources to choose from.  There are 
a couple of interesting pictures of planet Earth from space.  One of them 
is a very intense picture of the globed in infrared, which shows the <A 
HREF="http://www.sgi.com/Fun/free/climate.html">global climate 
zones</A>.  You can also find many other satalite photos of the Earth's 
atmosphere, including pictures of CO2 concentrations around the globe, 
and where UV rays are highest on the <A 
HREF="http://sst.lanl.gov/index.html">Nonproliferation and International 
Security division Home Page</A>.  These web site should prove to be 
useful and informative for your Physics class.
