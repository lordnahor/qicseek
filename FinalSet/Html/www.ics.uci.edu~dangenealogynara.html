<H2>Requesting Forms from the National Archives</H2>
</center>

The National Archives does not answer requests for specific information
about a person through e-mail. &nbsp;
All such requests are done by sending them a form through
regular U.S. postal mail, <B>not</B> the internet/e-mail.
<P>
However, you can request forms by email:
<OL>
<LI>Address your email to:
  <A href="mailto:inquire@arch2.nara.gov"><tt>inquire@arch2.nara.gov</tt></A>
<LI>Put the word '<B>form</B>' in the subject.
<LI>In the text of your message,
    include your name and your postal mailing address
    (<I>not</I> your email address).
<LI>In the text of your message, also state
    the number of the form, picking from
    the following list:
   <UL>
   <LI><B><U>GIL #7</U></B> - (brochure for Military Service Records)
   <LI><B><U>Form 80</U></B> - (Military service and pension records
       prior to World War I, including the Revolutionary War,
       War of 1812, Civil War, and Spanish-American War)
   <LI><B><U>Form 81</U></B> - (Passenger Arrivals)

   <LI><B><U>Form 84</U></B> - (Land Entry papers -- Federal lands only)
   <LI><B><U>Form 180</U></B> - (Military service records,
     World War I and later). &nbsp; Form 180 can be downloaded
     directly from <a href="http://www.nara.gov/regional/mpr.html">here</a>.
   </UL>
<LI>Also state how many copies of the form you wish to receive.
</UL>

Requests which do not contain the word 'form'
in the subject line get routed differently
and will take more time to process.
