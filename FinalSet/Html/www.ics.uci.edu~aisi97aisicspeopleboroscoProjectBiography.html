<BR>
<P>
Between the ages of 1 and 15, I grew up on various ranches;
I completed my high school education with honors.
Before I could get my acceptance form (at that time) Northrop School of
Engineering, my draft number came up.  I entered into the military attended
Warrant Officer Candidate School in Mineral Wells, Texas and acquired a
rotary-wing certification.  I accepted an earlier discharge because of
termination of the Vietnam conflict.  I returned at the age of 20 and returned
back to work in the greater Los Angeles area.

Between the ages of 20 and 27, I continued my education at various colleges.
Periodically I accepted various military assignments at different times and
for various reasons.

Originally I focused my education in chemical engineering;
returned to the manufacturing industry with emphasis on machine tool 
technology.

Four years ago while working for an explosives company, I suffered some
serious injuries during an experiment in the development of a new explosive
material.  After 2 years of rehabilitation I returned to school and
