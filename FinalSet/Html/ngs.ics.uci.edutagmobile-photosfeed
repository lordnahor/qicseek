				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Almost everyday a new photo related application is prominently in News.  Mobile phone cameras have pushed photography to new heights in its utilization and excitement. This has been going on for quite some time now.  One can not help but think whether there is a real transformation going on or is it just a froth that is going to disappear soon.</p>
<p>We are definitely going through a transformation in how we communicate and what we are seeing is the early stage of the new communication media.  Writing was invented for capturing fleeting speech.  That changed the culture by creating opportunities to share &#8216;speech&#8217; across time and space.  However speech is what a person articulates about his experience.  Speech represents articulation of experiences mediated by the person &#8212; it does not represent direct experience.  What we see or what we hear or what we experience from a vantage point in a real world is the fleeting sense of vision and sound.  Humans always wanted to capture these fleeting experiences, but there were no &#8216;means&#8217; to do that.  Technology has now transformed that.  Now it is possible to economically capture these fleeting or ephemeral experiences and make them eternal.  </p>
<p>Current excitement is the excitement of &#8216;look what we can do now&#8217;.  Where do we go from here and how do we use this newly discovered exciting capability is very intriguing.  I see enormous new trends emerging in near future.  As usual, the best practices of the time will survive and shape the future.  History has shown that neither the marketing alone nor the technology alone shapes the future, it is solid technology backed by creative imagination of its utilization that not only survives but also shapes our culture.  I believe that we are at the beginning of this new culture.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been working with a team of entrepreneurs in designing a Visual Sharing and Reflection system based primarily on mobile phones.    It is nice to see that this application, called VisR, is now released on Android. From the description of the application,</p>
<blockquote><p>
VisR:</p>
<p>VisR helps you spontaneously capture, share, organize, and reflect on moments effortlessly.  Seize the moments and relive with friends and family. Never again spend countless tedious hours searching for and organizing pictures on your phone.  </p>
<p>Do you love sharing  experiences, but find it aggravating to locate the perfect picture to describe it?  VisR removes this issue. VisR automagically classifies and organizes photos utilizing information readily available on your mobile phone in a what, when, where, and who form that is specific to you. You can find the photo of interest and with a few taps post it to your favorite place such as Facebook or Twitter.
</p></blockquote>
<p>iPhone application is coming soon.</p>
<p>Currently VisR is free and is also supported by a website where you can see all photos shared by you and others.  As usual, what you see is a very early functionality of this system.  The team wants to move fast and make an application that allows you to share your moments (may be using special effects and special lenses) spontaneously, but also effortlessly organize all the photos that you take in a form natural for you to access and share.  It uses events to organize photos but these events, unlike many current systems, and not just the date, but use multiple sources to identify them.</p>
<p>I am very happy to share this News with you.  I do intend to use all the feedback and work with the team in refining the system so my almost 20 year old dream of organizing and accessing photos and other visual media may become reality soon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my travels, I am amazed how many photos are now being captured using mobile devices.  At one time, I thought mobile cameras were just  third-class cameras used when you donâ€™t have the real one.  In just a few years, my opinion has changed: mobile cameras are becoming, if not already become,  the real cameras, the other cameras are more specialized devices used only on special occasions.  Mobile cameras are now taking the role of the â€˜penâ€™ that became more powerful than the sword about two century ago.  Mobile cameras are facilitating not only capturing â€˜momentsâ€™, but taking notes, creating stories,  sharing compelling experiences.  The only thing lacking is really a powerful environment to facilitate use of the captured data easily and appropriately.</p>
<p>Recently many interesting photo applications â€“ most notably Instagrams â€“ have been gaining popularity.  Flickr was good but was developed before mobile cameras started becoming mainstream.  Applications like Instagrams are becoming popular, because they do serve an impulsive sharing need.  I am sure we are going to see many more like those.  But currently, such services are being designed considering a component in the information sharing eco-system that has visual component.  Clearly a nice step.</p>
<p>But is this the real revolution in use of Mobile cameras?  Somehow it appears like the first step that is like climbing the tallest tree when your ambition is to get to the Moon.  So, the real question is how can we really develop technology eco-system that will take us to the Moon of compelling visual communication for sharing experiences.</p>
