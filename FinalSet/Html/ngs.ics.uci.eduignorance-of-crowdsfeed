		<description><![CDATA[What we need is a wake-up call about the quality of sites like Wikipedia - which calls itself an encyclopedia but is a rather unreliable political  campaign instrument for anonymous editors with a hidden agenda. A wake-up call about the fact that misinformation on the Internet is more widespread than it seems and that &quot;free information&quot; can be very costly once you wrecked your health, finance or friendships using bogus information from so called social networking sites. I am not calling for authorities but the amount of data - useless as well as useful - on the Internet is way bigger than the capability of its users to correctly evaluate it. And that is why I think a discussion like the one Keen is stirring up is way overdue.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[These are good questions, Ashish.  And we are going thru a period redefining lots of brick-and-mortar, or should I say paper-and-pencil, mechanisms to the cyber mechanisms.  I am a big believer in society developing appropriate mechanisms over time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with you on this. I raised similar issue in my weblog sometime back. People and society will find ways to focus back on what matters most  for them and filter the noise.

&quot;In  web of user generated content finding relevant and high quality content is a specially difficult problem.&quot;

You expressed  it much better with &quot; what is trustworthy, valuable, and reliable.&quot;

Questions remain.

1) How do we objectively define what is relevant and quality content?
2) Is majority recommendation neccassary relevant and high quality content?
