		<description><![CDATA[Looks like a very interesting project, Toby.

And about videos, I think popularity of video will result in better understanding among people and hence more peace.

Cheers,]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I couldn&#039;t agree with you more here about the concurrence of text &amp; video as equally useful info streams which will become more &amp; more useful with increased user friendliness.  

I just had a friend discover her editing program on her Mac which she then used to edit her grown son&#039;s videos of eagles feeding in Alaska, plus assorted other wildlife.  Unfortunately, youTube has a ten minute limit and hers was longer than that so she won&#039;t be posting any time soon....  and she is quite the creative user so certainly there will be a longer curve before we see what ppl can really do once they let it rip!  LOL.  

For your own interest, her website is www.peacemandala.com - she has several sites but this one might appeal - more on a hunch than anything else.   happy new year and new president!]]></description>
