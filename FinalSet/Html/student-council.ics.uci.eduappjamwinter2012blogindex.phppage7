<p><strong>Current Project Status:</strong><br />
No coding has been done yet, but we have decided on all of the basic features of our app. The general layout for the UI has also been sketched out.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Today:</strong><br />
We met this evening to further discuss the feature set and UI for the app. We are set on the main features that we want to implement and we have a good idea of how the app will look and how the user will interact with it. Also, we discussed what each of us will have to read and learn in preparation for coding the project.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong><br />
Each of us will have to do some studying to learn how to implement certain features. This may be a struggle because we are also dealing with midterms and projects. We will also have to set up a system in which we will coordinate our programming.</p>

<div class="content">
<p>Today was an awesome day for Team eMotion.</p>
<p>We were able to get a ton of things accomplished once we were able to find an empty room on campus for the day.</p>
<p>Today, if nothing else, I learned that the best way to collaborate and work with others is by being open to discussion and question and answer. We were able to manage all the administrative parts of our schedules very quickly because our communication was spectacular; we were all really on the ball.</p>
<p>We were able to created a basic template for our application. install and start up any software we need to use for collaboration (e.g Git), organize our meeting times for the rest of the project, and resolve all the bugs we had trying to manage the version control system with our project.</p>
<p>It was great to be able to collaborate together and set our path for the rest of the week in such a short amount of time. Even though meeting times may have been an issue until now, and problems came up while installing, by keeping our thoughts flowing, and sharing them with each other, we have already started down the path to completion at a fast pace.</p>
<p>I am excited to see what will happen tomorrow.</p>

<p>Current Project Status:</p>
<p>We have a general idea of what we want to make. However we are trying to narrow down the possible functions to come up with an app we can finish by next week.</p>
<p>Progress Today:</p>
<p>Met today in the evening. Spent most of the meeting  trying to flesh our idea more thoroughly. Right now not many of us have android experience or any experience developing in PHP and mySQL so we also spent a lot of time reviewing tutorials. Set up our repo using Github and we all have our development environment working, although some random errors we ran into made it take longer then expected. Plan on meeting again tomorrow and hopefully starting major coding.</p>
<p>Challenges:</p>
<p>We feel a bit behind compared to other teams because of our lack of experience compared to what we feel some other teams may have. Additionally, everyone in the group has projects and tests throughout the week, seeing as it near the end of the quarter.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Current Project Status:</span><br />
The app is still in alpha stage. Our original idea was realized to be too extravagant and unfeasible, so we decided to first work on implementing a simple version of the app and add the extra features if time allows. We as a group has successfully assessed what our  individuals strengths are and have delegated tasks to sub-teams. The basic wire diagram/flow of the app has been agreed upon and we are all working to implement our daily task</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Progress Today:</span></p>
<p><em>Android (Client Side):</em><br />
We are in the process of laying out the basic framework/flow of Activities. This sub-team continually has an open channel of conversation with the Design sub-team, receiving updates and discussing design/implementation issues.</p>
<p>DataBase/Server:<br />
We decided to use an Apache Tomcat/MySql platform unfortunately the provided webspace didn&#8217;t support that. So to fix this problem we set up the server environment on a Amazon EC2 instance. Our basic objective today was to get an Android client to communicate with an HTTP server.</p>
<p>Design:</p>
<p>We were able to finish a rough mockup of what the user will see when accessing the app. The design is somewhat restricted to certain layouts that android provides due to the time restriction and the difficulty of the code, but we were able to work our way around the obstacles by constantly communicating with the android team. We are currently working on the graphics that will eventually be implemented into the app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Challenges:<br />
</span>One of challenge that we have faced so far was drawing the line between what we want in the app as opposed to do what is feasible to put in the app. The more features and eye-catching views we want to include equates to us learning more and more about Android, as none of us has ever developed an Android app near this scale.</p>

<p>Current Progress Status:</p>
<p>Today we were not able to meet up as a team until around 6:30 p.m. tonight. There was some confusion on where we would be meeting so finding one another was a little more difficult than necessary. Once we all got together and started working, things went very smoothly. Since we mutually decided upon an idea last night, we already had a general idea of what needed to happen today.</p>
<p>So far we have created our home screen layout, collected some of the data that we will need in our app, and uploaded that data to the database. We will continue working tonight to get as much progress done as we can tonight and try and establish some goals for tomorrow.</p>
<p>Challenges:<br />
Since everything is still very basic in terms of the current tasks, we have not been faced with too many challenges today. However, I am sure there will be great challenges to overcome in the near future&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Current Project Status:</strong></p>
<p>We have developed a solid foundation for our app. We have also begun drawing the layout of the app with a mock up program, and we divided jobs among the group members. For example, parts of the code are divided among the members, and other people had to collect the necessary information needed for the app. We are currently in the phase of writing the code and designing the layout.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Today:</strong></p>
<p>Today, we met up with each other and solidify our idea(s) for the app. We found sources to aid us in developing this application and we have a vision for the UI. We divided the tasks among group members and each of us has begun our parts of the app project. We know our target audience and we have a general idea of how to pitch this app to that audience.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<p>Although we are unable to meet on a daily basis, we utilize facebook group and skype to communicate. But other than meeting up with each other, the only other challenge is time. We have members who have other commitments and we are hoping to design and develop the app by the coming weekend.</p>

<p><strong>Current Project Status:</strong><br />
Currently, we have our idea for the app and basic design of the UI set. We have discussed the key features and even some extra for added versatility. Communication and planning is done through a Facebook group (when we can&#8217;t meet in person).</p>
<p><strong>Progress Today:</strong><br />
Today, we met in the evening and decided on an idea for the app and its basic functionality and features.  We have a vision for the UI, but we will need to make final decisions before we move forward with it. We received the webspace and MySQL database for use with the app, and we discussed how we will integrate it with our idea. We also did some minor delegation of tasks, but again, we will need to finalize our ideas before we can do serious work on the research/coding.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong><br />
It&#8217;s going to be tough finding time on the weekdays to make major headway on the app, so the weekends might be looking pretty busy for us. We&#8217;re also going to need to do a good amount of research in learning how to use the webspace and database with Android, in addition to coding with Android itself, as we do not have much experience with app development.</p>

<p>Current Project Status:<br />
We have come up with and decided on the final idea for our app. We have begun laying out the foundations and design specs for the app.</p>
<p>Progress Today:<br />
Today we met on campus at 11:00am to decide on our final idea for the app and begin work. We started by discussing each of the ideas we had come up with, and checking the Android Market to see if there were already similar apps out there. In the end we made our decision and went with the idea we were not able to find on the marketplace. We then began to flesh out the idea and talk about the different screens the app would require. In the end we decided on a tabbed interface with 5 screens to switch between. After that we familiarized everyone with how to use Mercurial, our version control system. We then made our starter project in Eclipse and uploaded it to our repository. Finally, we decided to each go learn more about developing for Android and then meet again tomorrow at the same time.</p>
<p>Challenges:<br />
Only one member of our team has any experience working with Android, and not much at that. We decided to go over the android workshops and learn more so that tomorrow we would be better prepared to code our app. We also decided we will be needing the MySQL database, so we need to get familiar with that and how to communicate with it.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Challengers</span>:  Though we&#8217;ve set times to meet, pressing matters and emergencies made our group unable to solidify our ideas. The few of us that showed up to our meeting started drawing the blueprints of our app. We will be dividing into teams that will focus on specific tasks (UI/Database/etc.). Meeting times have been difficult to coordinate for the first few days of the competition, but we have solid meetings for the latter half of the competition and will have on-the-spot meetings whenever possible until then.</p>
