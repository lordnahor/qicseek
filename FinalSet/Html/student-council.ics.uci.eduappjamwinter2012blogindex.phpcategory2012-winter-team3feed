<p>Currently we have a lot done, merging and finalizing is smooth with some difficulties. Everything is getting done, documentation and Power Points and everything. We are starting to wrap up the final features to be implemented.</p>
<p>Progress Today:</p>
<p>Today we finished up with the main interface of the application and we are getting closer to debugging the maps feature. We are running into bugs, but we are addressing them as they come. Progressing as a team, we are helping each other finish. Guerilla code-fare!</p>
<p>Challenges:</p>
<p>The biggest challenge is now the deadline.</p>

<p>Working on finalizing the UI features, making sure everything is working the way we want it to. We are also making sure we have the functionality needed for the app to work in its first stages. We are focusing on the basic features that will accomplish the necessities.</p>
<p>Progress Today:</p>
<p>Most of the application is done, we still have to implement a few features and fix the maps. We are working on the how the database is communicating with the application itself. We are also making progress on the overall aesthetic look of the application.</p>
<p>Challenges:</p>
<p>The biggest challenge today was splitting our existing user interface into multiple activities instead of one, so that we could utilize both tabs and list views. We could not have our whole team present, but we continued to work on finalizing the app. We also had some difficulty with the database.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Current Project Status:</p>
<p>Currently we have a basic, working User Interface for each tab of our application.   We have setup the SQL database and created the PHP files to interface with it.  We have implemented pins, panning, and current location with the google maps api.</p>
<p>Progress Today:</p>
<p>Today, finished up the database and started creating java classes to interface with the php files for the database.  We also added Expandable List and List view User Interfaces for our tabs.  We created custom images for the UI and map icons.</p>
<p>Challenges:</p>
<p>The biggest challenge today was splitting our existing user interface into multiple activities instead of one, so that we could utilize both tabs and list views.</p>

<p>Team Mnemonic</p>
<p>Platform 2.3.3 Google API</p>
<p>Patrick Do (Advisor)</p>
<p>So today we worked mostly on integrating our code and resolving conflicts in the merge. We decided to merge them in each others presence so as to alleviate the problems with conflict resolution, and it really helped out. Unfortunately, some of our code was incompatible as there were some classes that needed to extend others and as such couldn&#8217;t be joined, but this didn&#8217;t stop the freight train that is our perseverance. With hunger on our minds and the touch of the keyboard blistering our fingertips, we chipped away at the work, each member in silence aside from the solemn sound of the keyboard clicks nagging at the silence. We found comfort in the fact that we were able to appease the merging problem by applying a simple change to our UI, a simple change that preserved the inner beauty of the app while still maintaining the modern theme we are inviting. With a stream of code sweeping aside our mental exhaustion, we delegated new work, some to the UI and some to the database, and decided to retreat for all to bask in the radiance of determination on the sea of semicolons.</p>

<p>We are in the process of implementing Google maps API, interfacing with MySQL Database, and implementing UI.  We are also creating a logo.</p>
<p>Progress Today:</p>
<p>Today,  we implemented swipe gesture to change views.  We also implemented a tab based UI with custom images. Also, the basic UI layouts for each tab have been implemented.  We also got the basic map to show up using Google Maps API.</p>
<p>Challenges:</p>
<p>The major challenge so far has been trying to merge our code.</p>

We are in the process implementing a Google Map integration, MySQL integration, and a UI.</p>
<p>Progress Today:<br />
Today, we finialized our idea on our app. We also designed and implemented a rough UI. We shared the project containing our app with each other using Saros. At the end of the meeting we split tasks for each member to do for the app.</p>
<p>Challenges:</p>
<p>One challenge we had was agreeing on finalizing an idea for the app. Another challenge was that when we used Saros to share the project with each other for some reason we were unable to see the graphical layout of the xml files containing the UI.</p>

<p>So far, we have decided on an app, starting working on designing the user interface, started brainstorming on features and name, and setup version control.</p>
<p>Progress Today:</p>
<p>Today, we decided on an idea for our app.  We started brainstorming on what features we would like to implement and what we want to call the app.  We setup the SAROS plugin for Eclipse as a method of version control.</p>
<p>Challenges:</p>
<p>The major challenges we&#8217;ve had so far were  agreeing on an idea and agreeing on which features to implement.</p>
