		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not a big fan of G+ circles either. It has become apparent that Google has a considerable way to go still to catch up to Facebook&#039;s social presence. I&#039;m sure that the big G is not too concerned as they will be willing to play this game for a long time and continually try to improve their social applications.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ramesh, i agree about what you are saying, but we all know that Google is a industry leader today, and i believe what they do is considered trendy by others. That&#039;s a big advantage also, i&#039;m already seeing some ads on tv&#039;s about google plus, especially android phones.. So let us see how google + will change social market, what folks are planning about this market at google!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ramesh

You raise an interesting point about G+ circles. If your interest in G+ is mostly commercial with some family or interest sharing, then circles can split groups in a way that will work for you. The commercial split will probably be by how close and/or intense you want the relationship(?) to be. If you are interested in sharing ideas in the broad way that you suggest, then the approach is not very useful.

I believe that the concept was designed to keep G+ away from the shallow linking that you get in apps like Facebook and to give people an app that would allow fewer but deeper linkages. However, the commercial intent behind the app also comes through in the design.]]></description>
