As in previous natural disasters, the Indian government has made statements of concern and promised to provide assistance. The Indian airforce immediately flew to the Andaman Islands, where its base has been severely battered. Two naval ships were also dispatched. But the aid dispatched so far to alleviate the suffering of those left homeless in southern India has been limited. A belated advisory was issued to ships and fishermen to keep away from the coast for 24 hours.
