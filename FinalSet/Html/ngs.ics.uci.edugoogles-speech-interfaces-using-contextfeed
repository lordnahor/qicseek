		<description><![CDATA[This is interesting, my home ISP seems to be on cost reduction mode and they&#039;ve used voice recognition to direct all service calls,  it is 95% working except that it can run into a deadlock after you follow certain sequence of choices (5% chances). In this event you can&#039;t get out of it, you hang up and do it all over again, and run into the same deadlock. 

I hope Google&#039;s system is better, at least it should provide a way out of possible deadlock. By the way, Microsoft is reportedly researching all sorts of speech recognition, so where is the product? It is shame for Microsoft to let Google lead on this again.]]></description>
