		<description><![CDATA[Btw, there was a NYT article last month (sorry, don&#039;t have the link) which discussed the sales slowdown of digital cameras as people begin to take most of their photos with mobile devices.   As mobile cameras improve it will only hasten the demise of the digital camera.

Mobile is the most Borg-like technology there has ever been.  It consumes other markets over and over again.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Have spent quite a bit of time trying to understand Instagram, Hipsmatic, Path and others.  They are all addressing socializing with photos instantly captured on mobile devices and shared on FB, Twitter, MySpace etc.  

Their plan is to create photo-based social networks and I&#039;m not convinced how this is going to be possible.  For example, &gt;100m photos are uploaded to FB every day and how long before FB has a similar capability to Instagram et al?  Since these startups are all investor funded the strategy must be to sell to FB, Twitter, MySpace, or Yahoo!]]></description>
