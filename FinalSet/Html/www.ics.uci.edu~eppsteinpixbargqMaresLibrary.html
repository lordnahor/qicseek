This time we went in to the Mares museum.  In the entrance courtyard, there was some kind of convention of collectors of cards, coins, champagne bottle tops, and who knows what.  Inside most of the museum was more of the same -- it's no coincidence that the collectors chose this location for their get-together -- but this library held many examples of Mares' own sculptures.
