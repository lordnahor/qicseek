Describes efficient sequential and parallel algorithms for orienting the edges of
an undirected planar graph so that each vertex has few outgoing edges.
From such an orientation one can test in constant time whether a given edge exists.
One consequence is a parallel algorithm to list all subgraphs isomorphic to K3 or K4.
More recently this paper has been cited for its applications to
scheduling update operations in parallel finite element methods.

The complement of a
<a href="mst.html">minimum spanning tree</a> is a maximum spanning tree in
the dual graph.  By applying this fact we can use a modified form of
Sleator and Tarjan's dynamic tree data structure to update the MST in
logarithmic time per update.

It was known that planar graphs have O(<i>n</i>) subgraphs isomorphic
to K<sub>3</sub> or K<sub>4</sub>. That is, K<sub>3</sub> and
K<sub>4</sub> have linear subgraph multiplicity.
This paper shows that the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in
the planar graphs are exactly the 3-connected planar graphs.
Also, the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in the outerplanar
graphs are exactly the 2-connected outerplanar graphs.
<p>
More generally, let F be a minor-closed family, and let x be the
smallest number such that some complete bipartite graph K<sub>x,y</sub>
is a forbidden minor for F. Then the x-connected graphs have linear
subgraph multiplicity for F, and there exists an
(x&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1)-connected graph (namely
K<sub>x&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1,x&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1</sub>) that does not
have linear subgraph multiplicity.
When x&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;3 or when x&nbsp;=&nbsp;4 and the minimal
forbidden minors for F are triangle-free, then the graphs with linear
subgraph multiplicity for F are exactly the x-connected graphs.

Uses an idea of Baker to cover a planar graph with subgraphs
of low treewidth.  As a consequence, any fixed pattern can
be found as a subgraph in linear time; the same methods can be used to
solve other planar graph problems
including vertex connectivity, diameter, girth, induced subgraph
isomorphism, and shortest paths.
A companion paper, "<a href="p-dtwmcgf.html">Diameter and treewidth in
minor-closed graph families</a>", presents a result announced in the
conference version of this paper,
that exactly characterizes the minor-closed graph families for which the
same techniques apply.

Any algorithm that maintains the connected components
of a bitmap image must take Omega(log <i>n</i> / log log <i>n</i>)
time per change to the image.  The problem can be solved in 
O(log <i>n</i>) time per change using dynamic planar graph techniques.
We discuss applications to computer Go and other games.

<p>
This paper introduces the <i>diameter-treewidth
property</i> (later known as <i>bounded local treewidth</i>): a
functional relationship between the diameter of its graph and its treewidth.
Previously known results imply that planar graphs have
bounded local treewidth; we characterize the
other minor-closed families with this property. Specifically,
minor-closed family F has bounded local treewidth if and only if there
exists an <i>apex graph</i> G that is not in F; an apex graph is a graph
that can be made planar by removing a single vertex.
The minor-free families that exclude an apex graph (and therefore have
bounded local treewidth) include the bounded-genus
graphs (for which, as with planar graphs, we show a linear bound for the
treewidth as a function of the diameter) and K<sub>3,a</sub>-free graphs.  As
a consequence, subgraph isomorphism for subgraphs of bounded size and
approximations to several NP-hard optimization problems can be computed
efficiently on these graphs, extending previous results for planar
graphs.
<p>Some of these results
were announced in the conference version of
"<a href="p-psgi.html">subgraph isomorphism for planar graphs and related
problems</a>" but not included in the journal version. Since its
publication, there have been many more works on local treewidth. The class of
problems that could be solved quickly on graphs of bounded local
treewidth was extended and classified by Frick and Grohe, "<a
href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/504794.504798">Deciding first-order
properties of locally tree-decomposable structures</a>", <i>J. ACM</i>
48:1184-1206, 2001;
the proof that bounded local treewidth is equivalent to having an
excluded apex minor was simplified, and the dependence of the treewidth
on diameter
improved, by a subsequent paper of Demaine and Hajiaghayi, "<a href="http://erikdemaine.org/papers/DiameterTreewidth_Algorithmica/">Diameter and
treewidth in minor-closed graph families, revisited</a>", <i>Algorithmica</i>
40:211-215, 2004. The concept of local treewidth is the basis for the
theory of <i>bidimensionality</i>, a general framework for
fixed-parameter-tractable algorithms and approximation algorithms in
minor-closed graph families; for a survey, see Demaine and Hajiaghayi,

We describe two algorithms for finding planar layouts of
<a href="graph-cube.html">partial cubes</a>:
one based on
<a href="p-latdim.html">finding the minimum-dimension
lattice embedding of the graph</a> and then projecting
the lattice onto the plane,
and the other based on representing the graph
as the planar dual to a weak pseudoline arrangement.
<p>
Due to editorial mishandling there will be no journal version of this
paper: I submitted it to a journal in 2004, the reviews were supposedly
sent back to me in 2005, but I didn't receive them and didn't respond to
them, leading the editors to assume that I intended to withdraw the submission.
Large portions of the paper have since been incorporated into my
book <i>Media Theory</i>, making journal publication moot.

We study straight-line drawings of planar graphs with few segments and
few slopes. Optimal results are obtained for all trees. Tight bounds are
obtained for outerplanar graphs, 2-trees, and planar 3-trees. We prove
that every 3-connected plane graph on n vertices has a plane drawing
with at most 5n/2 segments and at most 2n slopes. We prove that
every cubic 3-connected plane graph has a plane drawing with three
slopes (and three bends on the outerface).

We consider graph drawing algorithms for learning spaces, a type of
st-oriented partial cube derived from antimatroids and used to model
states of knowledge of students. We show how to draw any st-planar
learning space so all internal faces are convex quadrilaterals with the
bottom side horizontal and the left side vertical, with one minimal and
one maximal vertex. Conversely, every such drawing represents an
$st$-planar learning space.  We also describe connections between these
graphs and arrangements of translates of a quadrant.

find the minimum value of &lambda; for which the graph contains no

Tutte's method of spring embeddings allows any triangulated planar graph
to be drawn so that the outer face has any pre-specified convex shape,
but it may place vertices exponentially close to each other. Alternative
graph drawing methods provide polynomial-area straight line drawings but
do not allow the outer face shape to be specified. We describe a drawing
method that combines both properties: it has polynomial area, and can
match any pre-specified shape of the outer face, even a shape in which
some of the vertices have 180 degree angles. We apply our results to
drawing polygonal schemas for graphs embedded on surfaces of positive genus.
