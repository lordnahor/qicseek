<font color="#660033 size="+1"><i>Who is Indian?</i></font><br>
           <p>No single federal or tribal criteria establishes a person's identity as an 		Indian.
           To be eligible for Bureau of Indian Affairs services, an Indian must (1) be a
           member of a tribe recognized by the federal government and (2) must, for some
           purposes, be of one-fourth or more Indian ancestry.</p>

<font color="#660033 size="+1"><i>What is an Indian Tribe?</i></font><br>
<p>         Originally, an Indian tribe was a body of people bound together by blood ties 		that were socially, politically, and religiously organized, who lived 		together in a defined territory and who spoke a common language or dialect.
           The establishment of the reservation system created some new tribal groupings
           when two or three tribes were placed on one reservation, or when members of 		one tribe were spread over two or three reservations.</p>

<font color="#660033 size="+1"><i>What is a reservation?</i></font><br>
          <p> An Indian reservation is land a tribe reserved for itself when it 		relinquished its other land areas to the U.S. through treaties.</p>

<font color="#660033 size="+1"><i>Are Indians required to stay on reservations?</i></font><br>
<p>           No. Indians are free to move above like all other Americans.</p>

<font color="#660033 size="+1"><i>Are Indians wards of the government?</i></font><br>
<p>           No. The federal government is a trustee of Indian property, it is not a 		guardian of individual Indians. The Secretary of the Interior is authorized 		by law, in many instances, to protect the interests of minors and 		incompetents, but this protection does not confer a guardian-ward 		relationship.</p>

<font color="#660033 size="+1"><i>Are Indians U.S. citizens?</i></font><br>

<p>           Yes. Before the U.S. Congress extended American citizenship in 1924 to all
           Indians born in the territorial limits of the United States, citizenship had 		been conferred upon approximately two-thirds of the Indian population through 		treaty agreements, statutes, naturalization proceedings, and by "service in 		the Armed Forces with an honorable discharge" in World War I. Indians are 		also members of their respective tribes.</p>
<font color="#660033 size="+1"><i>How do Indian tribes govern themselves?</i></font><br>

	<p>Most tribal governments are organized democratically, that is, with an eleceted leadership. The governing body is generally referred to as a "council" ans is compirsed of persons elected by vote of the eligible adult tribal memeber.  The presiding official is called the "chairman," although some tribes use other titles such as "principal chief." </p>
	Tribal governments generally define conditions of memebership, regulate domestic relations of members, prescribe rules of inheritance for reservation property not in trust status, levy taxes, regulate property under tribal jurisdiction, control conduct of member by tribal ordinances, and administer justice.</p><br>

<font color="#660033 size="+1"><i>Do Indians have any special rights different from other citizens?</i></font><br>
	<p>Any special rights that Indian tribes or member of those tribes have are generally based on treaties or other agreements between the United States and tribes.  The heavy price Indians paid to retain certain "sovereign" rights was to relinquih much of their land to the United States. The inherent rights they did not relinquish are protected by U.S. law. Among those may be huting and fishing rights and access to religious sites.</p>
<font color="#660033 size="+1"><i>What does tribal sovereignty mean to Indians?</i></font><br>
	<p>When Indian tribes first encountered Europeans, they were dealt with from strength of numbers and were treated as sovereigns with whom treaties were made.  When tribes were forced to give up their lands to the U.S., they retained certain sovereingty over the lands they kept.  While such sovereignty is limited today, it is nevertheless jealously guarded by the tribes against enroachments by other sovereign entities such as states.  Tribes enjoy a direct government-to-governement relationship with the U.S government wherein no decisions about their lands and people are made without their consent.</p>
