<P>Hello fellow Internet surfer and welcome to my home page. I'm
very glad that you made it this far . . . and I hope that you'll stick
around long enough to get to know just a little bit more about me and my
life. After all, these days, acquaintances that begin in cyberspace are
often the most real, vivid, and long-lasting - and maybe that will be true
of us. <BR>

<CENTER><P>I was born in Torrance, Ca on June 3, 1979 in the disco age.
I lived in Gardena most of my life and spent some more time in Bishop and
Montebello. I am the oldest of three children. </P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>I just graduated high school. The accomplishment of my life(so
far). I thought I never would do it but I did. Others thought I wouldn't
either but I showed them.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>And, before we go any further, just in case (not that I'm looking
to get hired, but - just <BR>
in case you ARE my big break), here's my <A HREF="resume.html">resume</A>.

<CENTER><P>I guess that the best - and fastest - way to really get to know
me <BR>
is by discovering what I like. So here goes . . . </P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>I absolutely love to read especially horror stories King, Koontz,
Craven, Barker, Saul, you name it. I have been slipping into the Classics,
slowly but surely. I also love to play sports any and all. If I don't know
how, teach me, and I'll play. I also enjoy camping, backpacking, and fishing.
(Thanks to my father.)<BR>

<CENTER><P>Another way to really get to know someone - especially someone
who spends <BR>
as much time on the Internet as I do - is to learn their favorite sites:
