<p>Check back here every day or so.  I will generally post important coursewide announcements here.  They will be listed in reverse-chronological order (i.e., newest items first).</p>

      <p>Welcome!  Please note a couple of things as we get started this quarter:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The first lecture will meet on Tuesday, January 7.  There are no scheduled lab sections, but we will have informal lab meetings, which will begin on Tuesday, January 14.  For more information about meeting times of lab meetings, see the <a href="CourseReference.html">Course Reference</a>.  For information about lecture material and readings, see the <a href="Schedule.html">Schedule</a>.</li>
        <li>I encourage you to spend some time reading through the material on the course web site.  It will be updated periodically throughout the quarter, and there will always be an announcement here describing each update.  For now, notice the set of links at the top of this (and every) page, leading you to the <a href="CourseReference.html">Course Reference</a>, the <a href="Schedule.html">Schedule</a>, and the <a href="ProjectGuide">Project Guide</a>, as well as a set of <a href="CodeExamples">Code Examples</a> &mdash; mostly emanating from the lectures &mdash; that will be posted throughout the quarter.</li>
