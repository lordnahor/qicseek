Reviews</B></A><br>
<I>Definitely my personal favorite.  I love to watch movies during 
weekends.  This will be a great way to find out what's good and what's 
not.</I> 
<li><A HREF="http://metaverse.com/woodstock/index.html"><B>The Woodstock 
Home Page</B></A><br>
<I>Unbelievable!! Even cartoons have a place on the Net.  It's wonderful 
since little children will find navigating on the Net interesting and 
relevant to them.  This can be a great educational tool.</I>
<li><A HREF="http://nuscc.nus.sg/NUShome.html"><B>The National University 
of Singapore</B></A><br>
<I>This is absolutely amazing.  Even though I knew I am within reach of 
the entire world on the Net, I could not believe it is this 
easy. This discovery is especially exciting for me since I grew up in 
Singapore and almost went to its National University for college.</I>

<LI><A NAME="QQ1"><H2>What makes the Web so popular?</H2></A>
The Web, unlike its predecessors, is extremely <A 
HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/guide.61.html/guide.05.html#4">easy to 
use.</A>  Users do not have to master certain advanced technology to use 
the Web.  In this day and age, it is extremely important for 
communication and information transfer to be as efficient and as cheap 
as possible.  Vannevar Bush's <A 
HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/VBush.html.Z">As We May Think</A> 
describes the importance of highly-accessible information and communication.  The <A 
HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/guide.61.html/guide.01.html"> 
World Wide Web</A> provides exactly this easy access.  It is officially 
defined as a "wide-area hypermedia information retrieval initiative 
aiming to give universal access to a large universe of documents."<p><A 
HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ2"><H2>What are Web clients and servers, and how do 
they negotiate data format?</H2></A> 
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Terms.html#client">The client</A> 
is what a user uses to access the Web.  It requests and obtains 
information from <A 
HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Terms.html#server">the 
server</A>.  The server in turn searches for the information and 
delivers the answer of the request from the file that it serves back to 
the client.  The documents or resources are written in <A 
HREF="http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/reports/soasis-slides/HTML-Intro.html">Hypertext 
Markup Language (HTML)</A>.  The client tells the server what data 
formats it can handle, and the server delivers the document in the 
appropriate format.  The file name of the document helps the server to 
identify which format is being used.

<LI><A NAME="QQ3"><H2>"The X-files"--How popular is this T.V. show?</H2></A>
<P>I HAD no clue.  I have seen previews of each episode on television, but they look so 
bizarre and terrifying I did not have the nerve to watch any.  But when I found the 
<A HREF="http://www.rutgers.edu/x-files.html">X-Files Home Page</A>, with its full image 
and sound offerings, I was stunned.  I thought someone must be really serious about this 
show.  I looked through the web and discovered some very interesting information, including 
<A HREF="http://www.rutgers.edu/test/x-files/cast.html">Pictures of the Cast</A>, <A 
HREF="http://www.rutgers.edu/test/x-files/survey-report.html">Viewer Survey</A>, and an <A 
HREF="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cliff/xfiles-ep-guide.html">X-Files Episode 
Guide</A>.  I 
guess it should be safe to say that the "X-files" is a very popular 
show.</P> 
<p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ4"><H2>How does one construct a sentence in Spanish?</H2></A>
<P>First, you need to know the Spanish vocabulary for the words you want to use in your 
sentence. For beginners, you can use the <A 
HREF="http://www.willamette.edu/~tjones/forms/spanish.html">small 
English-Spanish Dictionary</A>.  If you already know the simple words, you 
might want to purchase a good dictionary from the <A 
HREF="gopher://gopher-server.cwis.uci.edu/7waissrc%3a/departments/books/BookstoreDatabaseSearch/browse.src?spanish+dictionary">UCI Bookstore</A>.  Next, 
you need to learn the basic verbs, prepositions, adjectives, and other grammar usages.  <A 
HREF="http://www.willamette.edu/~tjones/Spanish/lesson2.html">Spanish Lessons</A> will give 
you a brief idea of how to put different words together using the correct grammar. Practice 
writing simple sentences.  Ask your Spanish-speaking friends to help you.</P <p><A 
HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>

<LI><A NAME="QQ5"><H2>What's new in business today?</H2></A> 
First, the <A HREF="http://www.ora.com/cgi%2Dbin/ora/currency">Currency 
Exchange Rate</A> is extremely important.  It has tremendous direct as 
well as indirect impact on both domestic and international business.  
Second, politics, commerce and the society all have impacts on business, 
some in more ways than one.  It is therefore important not only to know 
about a specific industry, but  also of <A 
HREF="http://www.pbn.com/w021395.htm">business news in general</A>.  
If one is really serious about today's business, he or she could access 
the <A HREF="gopher://128.103.125.21/11/">Harvard Business School Publishing 
Menu</A> to find new, and better 
yet, analyzed, business information.<p><A HREF="#Questions"><it>Return to
