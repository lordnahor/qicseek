<hr>
<p><b>2.2</b>: Apply algorithm FINDINTERSECTIONS from this chapter
of the text, but terminate the algorithm as soon as it finds the
first intersection.</p>

<p><b>2.5</b>: All but the third equality are true.</p>

<p><b>8.2(a)</b>: The collection of lines that do not pass through
the top or bottom infinite cells of the three-line arrangement dual
to p, q, r.</p>

<p><b>8.2(b)</b>: The points on a line that are outside of some
line segment.</p>

<p><b>8.14</b>: Construct the dual line arrangement using algorithm
CONSTRUCTARRANGEMENT and look for the vertex with the largest
number of incident lines.</p>

<hr>
<p><b>3.6</b>: Lemma: any tree with vertex degree at most three has
an edgewhich splits the tree into two parts, each of which has at
least 1/3 of the vertices of the tree. (Proof idea: if an edge e
splits the tree more unevenly, one side of e contains more than 2/3
of the vertices, and one of its two neighboring edges on that side
gives a better split. So a split that can not be improved must at
least be 1/3-2/3.)So to solve the problem, triangulate the polygon,
apply the lemma to the dual tree, and split the polygon on the
diagonal dual to the tree-splitting edge.</p>

<p><b>4.7(a)</b>: A square can not be removed by rotation, but can
by translation. See below for rest of answer.</p>

<p><b>4.7(b)</b>: Draw a line perpendicular to each edge of the
object, through the counterclockwise endpoint of the edge. Form a
halfplane bounded by this line, on the other side of the line from
the edge. A center of rotation must be inside this halfplane, and a
center exists if and only if all these halfplanes have a nonempty
intersection. A translation corresponds to a pivot point at
infinity, so if the intersection is bounded, as in the drawing
below, the object can not be removed by a translation.</p>

<p><b>4.12(a)</b>: By construction, any item is equally likely to
be the last item in the permutation, so the probability of
generating any particular permutation is 1/n times the probability
of generating the permutation of the other n-1 items. But by
induction this is 1/(n-1)! so the probability of generating the
overall permutation is 1/n! as required.</p>

<p><b>4.12(b)</b>: If n=3, and we change the line, then there are
two calls to RANDOM(3) so the probability of any particular
sequence of events is 1/9 and the probability of any particular
output is a multiple of 1/9. But the desired output probability of
each permutation, 1/6, is not a multiple of 1/9.</p>

<p><b>15.1</b>: Choose a start and goal near the midpoints of
opposite edges of a regular n-gon.</p>

<hr>
<p><b>5.11</b>: Sweep a vertical line left-right across the line
segments, using a sorted list of segment endpoints to keep track of
the sweep events. Also keep a binary search tree of the
intersections of the sweep line with the horizontal segments,
sorted by the y-coordinates of the intersection, and store at each
node of the search tree a count of the number of descendants of
that node.When the sweep line crosses the left or right endpoint of
a horizontal segment, update the augmented binary search tree
appropriately. When the sweep line crosses a vertical segment, use
the search tree to count the number of horizontal segments it
crosses.</p>

<p><b>6.7</b>: Binary search to find the edge of P crossed by a ray
from p in the direction of q. If p is not given you could use
linear programming to find it as a preprocessing step.</p>

<p><b>7.7</b>: No. Whenever any new point is crossed by the sweep
line, it creates two new breakpoints, both moving in opposite
directions along the same Voronoi edge; unless this edge is
parallel to the sweep line, only one of the breakpoints will move
downwards.</p>

<p><b>10.9</b>: Store a range tree of left endpoints of
intervals.At each node of the range tree, store the intervals in
the canonical subset of the node, in sorted order by their right
endpoints. To answer a query, use the range tree to find O(log n)
canonical subsets covering the intervals with left endpoints
greater than x, and scan each canonical subset's sorted list until
reaching a right endpoint greater than x'.</p>

<p><b>12.10</b>: As the hint says, start the partition by using all
vertical lines x=2i where i is an integer and where the line cuts
at least one disk. Each disk is cut at most once so the total
complexity of all vertical strips after this step is at most 2n.
Next, within each strip, cut horizontally by lines y=2i whenever
such a line crosses a part of the disk within the strip; this again
at most doubles the total complexity. After these two stages,each
remaining cell of the partition can contain at most a constant
number of disk parts, so if we repeatedly find two parts in the
same cell and separate them by a line the complexity will remain
linear.</p>

<hr>

<p><b>9.8</b>: Let C be the circle circumscribing triangle
p<sub>i</sub>p<sub>j</sub>p<sub>k</sub>.  Form circle C<sub>i</sub> by
starting with C and continuously shrinking it, keeping the shrunken
circle tangent to C at p<sub>i</sub>, until it crosses q; the resulting
C<sub>i</sub> is empty and has q and p<sub>i</sub> on its boundary, so
qp<sub>i</sub> is a Delaunay edge.  By a symmetric argument, so are
qp<sub>j</sub> and qp<sub>k</sub>.</p>

<p><b>9.17</b>: Form an isosceles triangle with base smaller than its
height,
and add a fourth point outside the triangle and very close to the
midpoint of the base.  The Delaunay triangulation will use the diagonal
from the fourth point to the apex, the minimum weight triangulation will
instead use the isosceles triangle's base.</p>

<p><b>11.2</b>: Each new point uses at most linear time (due to the
upper bound theorem) so the total time is O(n^2).  One bad example
consists of n/2 points on or near a circle and n/2 points along or near
a line perpendicular to the circle through its center.  If the points
are added on the circle first, and then in increasing order of their
distance from the circle, each point along the line will have a visible
region boundary with complexity Theta(n) and the total complexity will
be Theta(n<sup>2</sup>).</p>

<hr>
<p><b>F1</b>: Two crossing double wedges each contain the apex of
the other wedge.</p>

<p><b>F2</b>: Use the lifting transformation taking each two
dimensional point (x,y) to a three dimensional point
(x,y,z=x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup>); a circle in two dimensions
separating the red points from the blue points corresponds to a
linear function ax+by+cz+d that is negative for the red points and
positive for the blue points.The constraint that ax+by+cz+d be
positive or negative is linear, so the coefficients a,b,c,d can be
solved as a linear programming feasibility problem.</p>

<p><b>F3(a)</b>: Form the arrangement of lines, preprocess it for
point location, and locate each input point within the
arrangement.</p>

<p><b>F3(b)</b>: Partition the lines arbitrarily into sqrt(m)
groups of sqrt(m) lines each, and apply part (a) separately to each
group.</p>

<p><b>F4</b>: The problem is somewhere in the sentence "When we
handle a query, we use the segment tree to find O(log n) canonical
sets, and we apply the query to the third-level data structure for
each set". The query does not have any information to tell us which
range of slopes to look at, so there is no obvious way of picking
out only O(log n) canonical sets to query.</p>
