<h2>EventShop</h2>
<b>Overview</b><br>
EventShop is our initial effort towards developing a framework over which applications for Social Life Networks will be developed. These applications make use of heterogeneous streams of data in order to detect situations. EventShop has abilities to process streaming data from heterogeneous data sources, detect various situations, as well as send out appropriate alerts to relevant users based on their current situations. Users can configure the system to detect different situations at different granularities, and take corresponding actions. In addition, our simple and user friendly GUI (shown below) allows nontechnical users to experiment with different data streams, and integrate them for diverse applications.<br>

EventShop draws inspiration from ImageShop. ImageShop provides several image processing operators which a user can interactively play around with. In the same way, EventShop lets a user to formulate and process a query on spatio-temporal data by using several spatio-temporal operators in the Operators Panel. The user can register data streams in the Data Source Panel, and then select one or more data streams to process. There is a panel to view the intermediate queries. Once the user is satisfied with the query formulation, it can be executed. Result of the query would be displayed in the Results Panel. The following video demonstrates how EventShop can be used to find regions within a hurricane's path are not adequate covered by relief shelters.<br>
