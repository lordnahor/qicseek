		<description><![CDATA[Hi,

Came to your site via Webyantra (www.webyantra.net), which has dome a profile of your company SEraja, which is about the event web. Heard this term for the first time, so curious about it. The product looks very good but as the review mentions, better communication is needed about its benefits and capabilities.
