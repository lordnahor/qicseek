<LI> In lecture we saw that if X has pdf = {.4,.2,.2,.1,.1}
then all 3 size-5 compact codes are optimal for X.
<UL type=a>
    <LI> Are there any other pdf's on 5 symbols for which this is true?
         If so, what are they?
    <LI> Is there a pdf on 6 symbols such that
         all 5 size-6 compact codes are optimal?

<LI> Binary-coded decimal (BCD) encodes 0 as 0000, 1 as 0001, and so on
up to 9, coded as 1001, with other 4-digit binary codes being discarded.
Consider a source that emits equally likely digits in the range 0-9.
It has entropy lg 10.  Consider encoding analagously in blocks, i.e.,
coding all <I>k</I>-blocks of decimal digits by binary <I>m</I>-blocks.
Prove that for suitable <I>k</I> and <I>m</I> you can get arbitrarily
near the lower bound lg 10 on codeword-length per decimal digit.

<LI> Three information sources with alphabet {a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h} are
characterized by the probabilities in the following table.  For each
source, find a binary, ternary, and quaternary (four code symbols)
Huffman code, and calculate its average length.
<pre>
              a     b      c      d     e      f      g    h
source 1     1/8   1/8    1/8    1/8   1/8    1/8    1/8  1/8
source 2     .1     .2     .1    .3    .05    .1     .05   .1
source 3     .15   .15    .15    .15    .1    .1     .1    .1
</pre>

<LI> Apply the adaptive Huffman method to the following
     11-symbol string "<tt>abracadabra</tt>".
     The encoder/decoder know that the universe of allowable source symbols
     consists of the 26 lowercase alphabetic characters.
     For each symbol input,
     show the output, the tree after the symbol has been added to it,
     and the tree after being rearranged (if necessary).
<BR> &nbsp;

<LI> Generate a binary sequence of length L with Prob(0) = 0.8,
     and use arithmetic coding to encode it.
     Plot the difference of the rate in bits/symbol
     and the entropy as a function of L.
     Comment on the effect of L on the rate.
<BR> &nbsp;

<LI> Assume a 2-symbol input alphabet {<tt>a, b</tt>}
     with probabilities {.7, .3}, respectively.
  <UL type=a>
  <LI> Encode strings "<tt>bab</tt>" and "<tt>aaa</tt>"
       in binary using arithmetic coding,
       assuming that the string lengths are known a priori.
  <LI> Now assume that strings are terminated with an &lt;eof&gt; character
       which is assigned a probability of .01, thereby changing the
       probabilities of {<tt>a, b</tt>} to {.7, .29} respectively.
       Again, encode each in binary using arithmetic coding.
